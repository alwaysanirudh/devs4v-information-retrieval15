036:014 Therefore thou shalt devour men no more, neither bereave thy
        nations any more, saith the Lord GOD.

036:015 Neither will I cause men to hear in thee the shame of the
        heathen any more, neither shalt thou bear the reproach of the
        people any more, neither shalt thou cause thy nations to fall
        any more, saith the Lord GOD.

036:016 Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

036:017 Son of man, when the house of Israel dwelt in their own land,
        they defiled it by their own way and by their doings: their
        way was before me as the uncleanness of a removed woman.

036:018 Wherefore I poured my fury upon them for the blood that they
        had shed upon the land, and for their idols wherewith they had
        polluted it:

036:019 And I scattered them among the heathen, and they were
        dispersed through the countries: according to their way and
        according to their doings I judged them.

036:020 And when they entered unto the heathen, whither they went,
        they profaned my holy name, when they said to them, These are
        the people of the LORD, and are gone forth out of his land.

036:021 But I had pity for mine holy name, which the house of Israel
        had profaned among the heathen, whither they went.

036:022 Therefore say unto the house of Israel, thus saith the Lord
        GOD; I do not this for your sakes, O house of Israel, but for
        mine holy name's sake, which ye have profaned among the
        heathen, whither ye went.

036:023 And I will sanctify my great name, which was profaned among
        the heathen, which ye have profaned in the midst of them; and
        the heathen shall know that I am the LORD, saith the Lord GOD,
        when I shall be sanctified in you before their eyes.

036:024 For I will take you from among the heathen, and gather you out
        of all countries, and will bring you into your own land.

036:025 Then will I sprinkle clean water upon you, and ye shall be
        clean: from all your filthiness, and from all your idols, will
        I cleanse you.

036:026 A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put
        within you: and I will take away the stony heart out of your
        flesh, and I will give you an heart of flesh.

036:027 And I will put my spirit within you, and cause you to walk in
        my statutes, and ye shall keep my judgments, and do them.

036:028 And ye shall dwell in the land that I gave to your fathers;
        and ye shall be my people, and I will be your God.

036:029 I will also save you from all your uncleannesses: and I will
        call for the corn, and will increase it, and lay no famine
        upon you.

036:030 And I will multiply the fruit of the tree, and the increase of
        the field, that ye shall receive no more reproach of famine
        among the heathen.

036:031 Then shall ye remember your own evil ways, and your doings
        that were not good, and shall lothe yourselves in your own
        sight for your iniquities and for your abominations.

036:032 Not for your sakes do I this, saith the Lord GOD, be it known
        unto you: be ashamed and confounded for your own ways, O house
        of Israel.

036:033 Thus saith the Lord GOD; In the day that I shall have cleansed
        you from all your iniquities I will also cause you to dwell in
        the cities, and the wastes shall be builded.

036:034 And the desolate land shall be tilled, whereas it lay desolate
        in the sight of all that passed by.

036:035 And they shall say, This land that was desolate is become like
        the garden of Eden; and the waste and desolate and ruined
        cities are become fenced, and are inhabited.

036:036 Then the heathen that are left round about you shall know that
        I the LORD build the ruined places, and plant that that was
        desolate: I the LORD have spoken it, and I will do it.

036:037 Thus saith the Lord GOD; I will yet for this be enquired of by
        the house of Israel, to do it for them; I will increase them
        with men like a flock.

036:038 As the holy flock, as the flock of Jerusalem in her solemn
        feasts; so shall the waste cities be filled with flocks of
        men: and they shall know that I am the LORD.

037:001 The hand of the LORD was upon me, and carried me out in the
        spirit of the LORD, and set me down in the midst of the valley
        which was full of bones,

037:002 And caused me to pass by them round about: and, behold, there
        were very many in the open valley; and, lo, they were very
        dry.

037:003 And he said unto me, Son of man, can these bones live? And I
        answered, O Lord GOD, thou knowest.

037:004 Again he said unto me, Prophesy upon these bones, and say unto
        them, O ye dry bones, hear the word of the LORD.

037:005 Thus saith the Lord GOD unto these bones; Behold, I will cause
        breath to enter into you, and ye shall live:

037:006 And I will lay sinews upon you, and will bring up flesh upon
        you, and cover you with skin, and put breath in you, and ye
        shall live; and ye shall know that I am the LORD.

037:007 So I prophesied as I was commanded: and as I prophesied, there
        was a noise, and behold a shaking, and the bones came
        together, bone to his bone.

037:008 And when I beheld, lo, the sinews and the flesh came up upon
        them, and the skin covered them above: but there was no breath
        in them.

037:009 Then said he unto me, Prophesy unto the wind, prophesy, son of
        man, and say to the wind, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Come from
        the four winds, O breath, and breathe upon these slain, that
        they may live.

037:010 So I prophesied as he commanded me, and the breath came into
        them, and they lived, and stood up upon their feet, an
        exceeding great army.

037:011 Then he said unto me, Son of man, these bones are the whole
        house of Israel: behold, they say, Our bones are dried, and
        our hope is lost: we are cut off for our parts.

037:012 Therefore prophesy and say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD;
        Behold, O my people, I will open your graves, and cause you to
        come up out of your graves, and bring you into the land of
        Israel.

037:013 And ye shall know that I am the LORD, when I have opened your
        graves, O my people, and brought you up out of your graves,

037:014 And shall put my spirit in you, and ye shall live, and I shall
        place you in your own land: then shall ye know that I the LORD
        have spoken it, and performed it, saith the LORD.

037:015 The word of the LORD came again unto me, saying,

037:016 Moreover, thou son of man, take thee one stick, and write upon
        it, For Judah, and for the children of Israel his companions:
        then take another stick, and write upon it, For Joseph, the
        stick of Ephraim and for all the house of Israel his
        companions:

037:017 And join them one to another into one stick; and they shall
        become one in thine hand.

037:018 And when the children of thy people shall speak unto thee,
        saying, Wilt thou not shew us what thou meanest by these?

037:019 Say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will take
        the stick of Joseph, which is in the hand of Ephraim, and the
        tribes of Israel his fellows, and will put them with him, even
        with the stick of Judah, and make them one stick, and they
        shall be one in mine hand.

037:020 And the sticks whereon thou writest shall be in thine hand
        before their eyes.

037:021 And say unto them, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I will
        take the children of Israel from among the heathen, whither
        they be gone, and will gather them on every side, and bring
        them into their own land:

037:022 And I will make them one nation in the land upon the mountains
        of Israel; and one king shall be king to them all: and they
        shall be no more two nations, neither shall they be divided
        into two kingdoms any more at all.

037:023 Neither shall they defile themselves any more with their
        idols, nor with their detestable things, nor with any of their
        transgressions: but I will save them out of all their
        dwellingplaces, wherein they have sinned, and will cleanse
        them: so shall they be my people, and I will be their God.

037:024 And David my servant shall be king over them; and they all
        shall have one shepherd: they shall also walk in my judgments,
        and observe my statutes, and do them.

037:025 And they shall dwell in the land that I have given unto Jacob
        my servant, wherein your fathers have dwelt; and they shall
        dwell therein, even they, and their children, and their
        children's children for ever: and my servant David shall be
        their prince for ever.

037:026 Moreover I will make a covenant of peace with them; it shall
        be an everlasting covenant with them: and I will place them,
        and multiply them, and will set my sanctuary in the midst of
        them for evermore.

037:027 My tabernacle also shall be with them: yea, I will be their
        God, and they shall be my people.

037:028 And the heathen shall know that I the LORD do sanctify Israel,
        when my sanctuary shall be in the midst of them for evermore.

038:001 And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

038:002 Son of man, set thy face against Gog, the land of Magog, the
        chief prince of Meshech and Tubal, and prophesy against him,

038:003 And say, Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I am against thee, O
        Gog, the chief prince of Meshech and Tubal:

038:004 And I will turn thee back, and put hooks into thy jaws, and I
        will bring thee forth, and all thine army, horses and
        horsemen, all of them clothed with all sorts of armour, even a
        great company with bucklers and shields, all of them handling
        swords:

038:005 Persia, Ethiopia, and Libya with them; all of them with shield
        and helmet:

038:006 Gomer, and all his bands; the house of Togarmah of the north
        quarters, and all his bands: and many people with thee.

038:007 Be thou prepared, and prepare for thyself, thou, and all thy
        company that are assembled unto thee, and be thou a guard unto
        them.

038:008 After many days thou shalt be visited: in the latter years
        thou shalt come into the land that is brought back from the
        sword, and is gathered out of many people, against the
        mountains of Israel, which have been always waste: but it is
        brought forth out of the nations, and they shall dwell safely
        all of them.

038:009 Thou shalt ascend and come like a storm, thou shalt be like a
        cloud to cover the land, thou, and all thy bands, and many
        people with thee.

038:010 Thus saith the Lord GOD; It shall also come to pass, that at
        the same time shall things come into thy mind, and thou shalt
        think an evil thought:

038:011 And thou shalt say, I will go up to the land of unwalled
        villages; I will go to them that are at rest, that dwell
        safely, all of them dwelling without walls, and having neither
        bars nor gates,

038:012 To take a spoil, and to take a prey; to turn thine hand upon
        the desolate places that are now inhabited, and upon the
        people that are gathered out of the nations, which have gotten
        cattle and goods, that dwell in the midst of the land.

038:013 Sheba, and Dedan, and the merchants of Tarshish, with all the
        young lions thereof, shall say unto thee, Art thou come to
        take a spoil? hast thou gathered thy company to take a prey?
        to carry away silver and gold, to take away cattle and goods,
        to take a great spoil?

038:014 Therefore, son of man, prophesy and say unto Gog, Thus saith
        the Lord GOD; In that day when my people of Israel dwelleth
        safely, shalt thou not know it?

038:015 And thou shalt come from thy place out of the north parts,
        thou, and many people with thee, all of them riding upon
        horses, a great company, and a mighty army:

038:016 And thou shalt come up against my people of Israel, as a cloud
        to cover the land; it shall be in the latter days, and I will
        bring thee against my land, that the heathen may know me, when
        I shall be sanctified in thee, O Gog, before their eyes.

038:017 Thus saith the Lord GOD; Art thou he of whom I have spoken in
        old time by my servants the prophets of Israel, which
        prophesied in those days many years that I would bring thee
        against them?

038:018 And it shall come to pass at the same time when Gog shall come
        against the land of Israel, saith the Lord GOD, that my fury
        shall come up in my face.

038:019 For in my jealousy and in the fire of my wrath have I spoken,
        Surely in that day there shall be a great shaking in the land
        of Israel;

038:020 So that the fishes of the sea, and the fowls of the heaven,
        and the beasts of the field, and all creeping things that
        creep upon the earth, and all the men that are upon the face
        of the earth, shall shake at my presence, and the mountains
        shall be thrown down, and the steep places shall fall, and
        every wall shall fall to the ground.

038:021 And I will call for a sword against him throughout all my
        mountains, saith the Lord GOD: every man's sword shall be
        against his brother.

038:022 And I will plead against him with pestilence and with blood;
        and I will rain upon him, and upon his bands, and upon the
        many people that are with him, an overflowing rain, and great
        hailstones, fire, and brimstone.

038:023 Thus will I magnify myself, and sanctify myself; and I will be
        known in the eyes of many nations, and they shall know that I
        am the LORD.

039:001 Therefore, thou son of man, prophesy against Gog, and say,
        Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I am against thee, O Gog, the
        chief prince of Meshech and Tubal:

039:002 And I will turn thee back, and leave but the sixth part of
        thee, and will cause thee to come up from the north parts, and
        will bring thee upon the mountains of Israel:

039:003 And I will smite thy bow out of thy left hand, and will cause
        thine arrows to fall out of thy right hand.

039:004 Thou shalt fall upon the mountains of Israel, thou, and all
        thy bands, and the people that is with thee: I will give thee
        unto the ravenous birds of every sort, and to the beasts of
        the field to be devoured.

039:005 Thou shalt fall upon the open field: for I have spoken it,
        saith the Lord GOD.

039:006 And I will send a fire on Magog, and among them that dwell
        carelessly in the isles: and they shall know that I am the
        LORD.

039:007 So will I make my holy name known in the midst of my people
        Israel; and I will not let them pollute my holy name any more:
        and the heathen shall know that I am the LORD, the Holy One in
        Israel.

039:008 Behold, it is come, and it is done, saith the Lord GOD; this
        is the day whereof I have spoken.

039:009 And they that dwell in the cities of Israel shall go forth,
        and shall set on fire and burn the weapons, both the shields
        and the bucklers, the bows and the arrows, and the handstaves,
        and the spears, and they shall burn them with fire seven
        years:

039:010 So that they shall take no wood out of the field, neither cut
        down any out of the forests; for they shall burn the weapons
        with fire: and they shall spoil those that spoiled them, and
        rob those that robbed them, saith the Lord GOD.

039:011 And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will give unto
        Gog a place there of graves in Israel, the valley of the
        passengers on the east of the sea: and it shall stop the noses
        of the passengers: and there shall they bury Gog and all his
        multitude: and they shall call it The valley of Hamongog.

039:012 And seven months shall the house of Israel be burying of them,
        that they may cleanse the land.

039:013 Yea, all the people of the land shall bury them; and it shall
        be to them a renown the day that I shall be glorified, saith
        the Lord GOD.

039:014 And they shall sever out men of continual employment, passing
        through the land to bury with the passengers those that remain
        upon the face of the earth, to cleanse it: after the end of
        seven months shall they search.

039:015 And the passengers that pass through the land, when any seeth
        a man's bone, then shall he set up a sign by it, till the
        buriers have buried it in the valley of Hamongog.

039:016 And also the name of the city shall be Hamonah. Thus shall
        they cleanse the land.

039:017 And, thou son of man, thus saith the Lord GOD; Speak unto
        every feathered fowl, and to every beast of the field,
        Assemble yourselves, and come; gather yourselves on every side
        to my sacrifice that I do sacrifice for you, even a great
        sacrifice upon the mountains of Israel, that ye may eat flesh,
        and drink blood.

039:018 Ye shall eat the flesh of the mighty, and drink the blood of
        the princes of the earth, of rams, of lambs, and of goats, of
        bullocks, all of them fatlings of Bashan.

039:019 And ye shall eat fat till ye be full, and drink blood till ye
        be drunken, of my sacrifice which I have sacrificed for you.

039:020 Thus ye shall be filled at my table with horses and chariots,
        with mighty men, and with all men of war, saith the Lord GOD.

039:021 And I will set my glory among the heathen, and all the heathen
        shall see my judgment that I have executed, and my hand that I
        have laid upon them.

039:022 So the house of Israel shall know that I am the LORD their God
        from that day and forward.

039:023 And the heathen shall know that the house of Israel went into
        captivity for their iniquity: because they trespassed against
        me, therefore hid I my face from them, and gave them into the
        hand of their enemies: so fell they all by the sword.

039:024 According to their uncleanness and according to their
        transgressions have I done unto them, and hid my face from
        them.

039:025 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Now will I bring again the
        captivity of Jacob, and have mercy upon the whole house of
        Israel, and will be jealous for my holy name;

039:026 After that they have borne their shame, and all their
        trespasses whereby they have trespassed against me, when they
        dwelt safely in their land, and none made them afraid.

039:027 When I have brought them again from the people, and gathered
        them out of their enemies' lands, and am sanctified in them in
        the sight of many nations;

039:028 Then shall they know that I am the LORD their God, which
        caused them to be led into captivity among the heathen: but I
        have gathered them unto their own land, and have left none of
        them any more there.

039:029 Neither will I hide my face any more from them: for I have
        poured out my spirit upon the house of Israel, saith the Lord
        GOD.

040:001 In the five and twentieth year of our captivity, in the
        beginning of the year, in the tenth day of the month, in the
        fourteenth year after that the city was smitten, in the
        selfsame day the hand of the LORD was upon me, and brought me
        thither.

040:002 In the visions of God brought he me into the land of Israel,
        and set me upon a very high mountain, by which was as the
        frame of a city on the south.

040:003 And he brought me thither, and, behold, there was a man, whose
        appearance was like the appearance of brass, with a line of
        flax in his hand, and a measuring reed; and he stood in the
        gate.

040:004 And the man said unto me, Son of man, behold with thine eyes,
        and hear with thine ears, and set thine heart upon all that I
        shall shew thee; for to the intent that I might shew them unto
        thee art thou brought hither: declare all that thou seest to
        the house of Israel.

040:005 And behold a wall on the outside of the house round about, and
        in the man's hand a measuring reed of six cubits long by the
        cubit and an hand breadth: so he measured the breadth of the
        building, one reed; and the height, one reed.

040:006 Then came he unto the gate which looketh toward the east, and
        went up the stairs thereof, and measured the threshold of the
        gate, which was one reed broad; and the other threshold of the
        gate, which was one reed broad.

040:007 And every little chamber was one reed long, and one reed
        broad; and between the little chambers were five cubits; and
        the threshold of the gate by the porch of the gate within was
        one reed.

040:008 He measured also the porch of the gate within, one reed.

040:009 Then measured he the porch of the gate, eight cubits; and the
        posts thereof, two cubits; and the porch of the gate was
        inward.

040:010 And the little chambers of the gate eastward were three on
        this side, and three on that side; they three were of one
        measure: and the posts had one measure on this side and on
        that side.

040:011 And he measured the breadth of the entry of the gate, ten
        cubits; and the length of the gate, thirteen cubits.

040:012 The space also before the little chambers was one cubit on
        this side, and the space was one cubit on that side: and the
        little chambers were six cubits on this side, and six cubits
        on that side.

040:013 He measured then the gate from the roof of one little chamber
        to the roof of another: the breadth was five and twenty
        cubits, door against door.

040:014 He made also posts of threescore cubits, even unto the post of
        the court round about the gate.

040:015 And from the face of the gate of the entrance unto the face of
        the porch of the inner gate were fifty cubits.

040:016 And there were narrow windows to the little chambers, and to
        their posts within the gate round about, and likewise to the
        arches: and windows were round about inward: and upon each
        post were palm trees.

040:017 Then brought he me into the outward court, and, lo, there were
        chambers, and a pavement made for the court round about:
        thirty chambers were upon the pavement.

040:018 And the pavement by the side of the gates over against the
        length of the gates was the lower pavement.

040:019 Then he measured the breadth from the forefront of the lower
        gate unto the forefront of the inner court without, an hundred
        cubits eastward and northward.

040:020 And the gate of the outward court that looked toward the
        north, he measured the length thereof, and the breadth
        thereof.

040:021 And the little chambers thereof were three on this side and
        three on that side; and the posts thereof and the arches
        thereof were after the measure of the first gate: the length
        thereof was fifty cubits, and the breadth five and twenty
        cubits.

040:022 And their windows, and their arches, and their palm trees,
        were after the measure of the gate that looketh toward the
        east; and they went up unto it by seven steps; and the arches
        thereof were before them.

040:023 And the gate of the inner court was over against the gate
        toward the north, and toward the east; and he measured from
        gate to gate an hundred cubits.

040:024 After that he brought me toward the south, and behold a gate
        toward the south: and he measured the posts thereof and the
        arches thereof according to these measures.

040:025 And there were windows in it and in the arches thereof round
        about, like those windows: the length was fifty cubits, and
        the breadth five and twenty cubits.

040:026 And there were seven steps to go up to it, and the arches
        thereof were before them: and it had palm trees, one on this
        side, and another on that side, upon the posts thereof.

040:027 And there was a gate in the inner court toward the south: and
        he measured from gate to gate toward the south an hundred
        cubits.

040:028 And he brought me to the inner court by the south gate: and he
        measured the south gate according to these measures;

040:029 And the little chambers thereof, and the posts thereof, and
        the arches thereof, according to these measures: and there
        were windows in it and in the arches thereof round about: it
        was fifty cubits long, and five and twenty cubits broad.

040:030 And the arches round about were five and twenty cubits long,
        and five cubits broad.

040:031 And the arches thereof were toward the utter court; and palm
        trees were upon the posts thereof: and the going up to it had
        eight steps.

040:032 And he brought me into the inner court toward the east: and he
        measured the gate according to these measures.

040:033 And the little chambers thereof, and the posts thereof, and
        the arches thereof, were according to these measures: and
        there were windows therein and in the arches thereof round
        about: it was fifty cubits long, and five and twenty cubits
        broad.

040:034 And the arches thereof were toward the outward court; and palm
        trees were upon the posts thereof, on this side, and on that
        side: and the going up to it had eight steps.

040:035 And he brought me to the north gate, and measured it according
        to these measures;

040:036 The little chambers thereof, the posts thereof, and the arches
        thereof, and the windows to it round about: the length was
        fifty cubits, and the breadth five and twenty cubits.

040:037 And the posts thereof were toward the utter court; and palm
        trees were upon the posts thereof, on this side, and on that
        side: and the going up to it had eight steps.

040:038 And the chambers and the entries thereof were by the posts of
        the gates, where they washed the burnt offering.

040:039 And in the porch of the gate were two tables on this side, and
        two tables on that side, to slay thereon the burnt offering
        and the sin offering and the trespass offering.

040:040 And at the side without, as one goeth up to the entry of the
        north gate, were two tables; and on the other side, which was
        at the porch of the gate, were two tables.

040:041 Four tables were on this side, and four tables on that side,
        by the side of the gate; eight tables, whereupon they slew
        their sacrifices.

040:042 And the four tables were of hewn stone for the burnt offering,
        of a cubit and an half long, and a cubit and an half broad,
        and one cubit high: whereupon also they laid the instruments
        wherewith they slew the burnt offering and the sacrifice.

040:043 And within were hooks, an hand broad, fastened round about:
        and upon the tables was the flesh of the offering.

040:044 And without the inner gate were the chambers of the singers in
        the inner court, which was at the side of the north gate; and
        their prospect was toward the south: one at the side of the
        east gate having the prospect toward the north.

040:045 And he said unto me, This chamber, whose prospect is toward
        the south, is for the priests, the keepers of the charge of
        the house.

040:046 And the chamber whose prospect is toward the north is for the
        priests, the keepers of the charge of the altar: these are the
        sons of Zadok among the sons of Levi, which come near to the
        LORD to minister unto him.

040:047 So he measured the court, an hundred cubits long, and an
        hundred cubits broad, foursquare; and the altar that was
        before the house.

040:048 And he brought me to the porch of the house, and measured each
        post of the porch, five cubits on this side, and five cubits
        on that side: and the breadth of the gate was three cubits on
        this side, and three cubits on that side.

040:049 The length of the porch was twenty cubits, and the breadth
        eleven cubits, and he brought me by the steps whereby they
        went up to it: and there were pillars by the posts, one on
        this side, and another on that side.

041:001 Afterward he brought me to the temple, and measured the posts,
        six cubits broad on the one side, and six cubits broad on the
        other side, which was the breadth of the tabernacle.

041:002 And the breadth of the door was ten cubits; and the sides of
        the door were five cubits on the one side, and five cubits on
        the other side: and he measured the length thereof, forty
        cubits: and the breadth, twenty cubits.

041:003 Then went he inward, and measured the post of the door, two
        cubits; and the door, six cubits; and the breadth of the door,
        seven cubits.

041:004 So he measured the length thereof, twenty cubits; and the
        breadth, twenty cubits, before the temple: and he said unto
        me, This is the most holy place.

041:005 After he measured the wall of the house, six cubits; and the
        breadth of every side chamber, four cubits, round about the
        house on every side.

041:006 And the side chambers were three, one over another, and thirty
        in order; and they entered into the wall which was of the
        house for the side chambers round about, that they might have
        hold, but they had not hold in the wall of the house.

041:007 And there was an enlarging, and a winding about still upward
        to the side chambers: for the winding about of the house went
        still upward round about the house: therefore the breadth of
        the house was still upward, and so increased from the lowest
        chamber to the highest by the midst.

041:008 I saw also the height of the house round about: the
        foundations of the side chambers were a full reed of six great
        cubits.

041:009 The thickness of the wall, which was for the side chamber
        without, was five cubits: and that which was left was the
        place of the side chambers that were within.

041:010 And between the chambers was the wideness of twenty cubits
        round about the house on every side.

041:011 And the doors of the side chambers were toward the place that
        was left, one door toward the north, and another door toward
        the south: and the breadth of the place that was left was five
        cubits round about.

041:012 Now the building that was before the separate place at the end
        toward the west was seventy cubits broad; and the wall of the
        building was five cubits thick round about, and the length
        thereof ninety cubits.

041:013 So he measured the house, an hundred cubits long; and the
        separate place, and the building, with the walls thereof, an
        hundred cubits long;

041:014 Also the breadth of the face of the house, and of the separate
        place toward the east, an hundred cubits.

041:015 And he measured the length of the building over against the
        separate place which was behind it, and the galleries thereof
        on the one side and on the other side, an hundred cubits, with
        the inner temple, and the porches of the court;

041:016 The door posts, and the narrow windows, and the galleries
        round about on their three stories, over against the door,
        cieled with wood round about, and from the ground up to the
        windows, and the windows were covered;

041:017 To that above the door, even unto the inner house, and
        without, and by all the wall round about within and without,
        by measure.

041:018 And it was made with cherubims and palm trees, so that a palm
        tree was between a cherub and a cherub; and every cherub had
        two faces;

041:019 So that the face of a man was toward the palm tree on the one
        side, and the face of a young lion toward the palm tree on the
        other side: it was made through all the house round about.

041:020 From the ground unto above the door were cherubims and palm
        trees made, and on the wall of the temple.

041:021 The posts of the temple were squared, and the face of the
        sanctuary; the appearance of the one as the appearance of the
        other.

041:022 The altar of wood was three cubits high, and the length
        thereof two cubits; and the corners thereof, and the length
        thereof, and the walls thereof, were of wood: and he said unto
        me, This is the table that is before the LORD.

041:023 And the temple and the sanctuary had two doors.

041:024 And the doors had two leaves apiece, two turning leaves; two
        leaves for the one door, and two leaves for the other door.

041:025 And there were made on them, on the doors of the temple,
        cherubims and palm trees, like as were made upon the walls;
        and there were thick planks upon the face of the porch
        without.

041:026 And there were narrow windows and palm trees on the one side
        and on the other side, on the sides of the porch, and upon the
        side chambers of the house, and thick planks.

042:001 Then he brought me forth into the utter court, the way toward
        the north: and he brought me into the chamber that was over
        against the separate place, and which was before the building
        toward the north.

042:002 Before the length of an hundred cubits was the north door, and
        the breadth was fifty cubits.

042:003 Over against the twenty cubits which were for the inner court,
        and over against the pavement which was for the utter court,
        was gallery against gallery in three stories.

042:004 And before the chambers was a walk to ten cubits breadth
        inward, a way of one cubit; and their doors toward the north.

042:005 Now the upper chambers were shorter: for the galleries were
        higher than these, than the lower, and than the middlemost of
        the building.

042:006 For they were in three stories, but had not pillars as the
        pillars of the courts: therefore the building was straitened
        more than the lowest and the middlemost from the ground.

042:007 And the wall that was without over against the chambers,
        toward the utter court on the forepart of the chambers, the
        length thereof was fifty cubits.

042:008 For the length of the chambers that were in the utter court
        was fifty cubits: and, lo, before the temple were an hundred
        cubits.

042:009 And from under these chambers was the entry on the east side,
        as one goeth into them from the utter court.

042:010 The chambers were in the thickness of the wall of the court
        toward the east, over against the separate place, and over
        against the building.

042:011 And the way before them was like the appearance of the
        chambers which were toward the north, as long as they, and as
        broad as they: and all their goings out were both according to
        their fashions, and according to their doors.

042:012 And according to the doors of the chambers that were toward
        the south was a door in the head of the way, even the way
        directly before the wall toward the east, as one entereth into
        them.

042:013 Then said he unto me, The north chambers and the south
        chambers, which are before the separate place, they be holy
        chambers, where the priests that approach unto the LORD shall
        eat the most holy things: there shall they lay the most holy
        things, and the meat offering, and the sin offering, and the
        trespass offering; for the place is holy.

042:014 When the priests enter therein, then shall they not go out of
        the holy place into the utter court, but there they shall lay
        their garments wherein they minister; for they are holy; and
        shall put on other garments, and shall approach to those
        things which are for the people.

042:015 Now when he had made an end of measuring the inner house, he
        brought me forth toward the gate whose prospect is toward the
        east, and measured it round about.

042:016 He measured the east side with the measuring reed, five
        hundred reeds, with the measuring reed round about.

042:017 He measured the north side, five hundred reeds, with the
        measuring reed round about.

042:018 He measured the south side, five hundred reeds, with the
        measuring reed.

042:019 He turned about to the west side, and measured five hundred
        reeds with the measuring reed.

042:020 He measured it by the four sides: it had a wall round about,
        five hundred reeds long, and five hundred broad, to make a
        separation between the sanctuary and the profane place.

043:001 Afterward he brought me to the gate, even the gate that
        looketh toward the east:

043:002 And, behold, the glory of the God of Israel came from the way
        of the east: and his voice was like a noise of many waters:
        and the earth shined with his glory.

043:003 And it was according to the appearance of the vision which I
        saw, even according to the vision that I saw when I came to
        destroy the city: and the visions were like the vision that I
        saw by the river Chebar; and I fell upon my face.

043:004 And the glory of the LORD came into the house by the way of
        the gate whose prospect is toward the east.

043:005 So the spirit took me up, and brought me into the inner court;
        and, behold, the glory of the LORD filled the house.

043:006 And I heard him speaking unto me out of the house; and the man
        stood by me.

043:007 And he said unto me, Son of man, the place of my throne, and
        the place of the soles of my feet, where I will dwell in the
        midst of the children of Israel for ever, and my holy name,
        shall the house of Israel no more defile, neither they, nor
        their kings, by their whoredom, nor by the carcases of their
        kings in their high places.

043:008 In their setting of their threshold by my thresholds, and
        their post by my posts, and the wall between me and them, they
        have even defiled my holy name by their abominations that they
        have committed: wherefore I have consumed them in mine anger.

043:009 Now let them put away their whoredom, and the carcases of
        their kings, far from me, and I will dwell in the midst of
        them for ever.

043:010 Thou son of man, shew the house to the house of Israel, that
        they may be ashamed of their iniquities: and let them measure
        the pattern.

043:011 And if they be ashamed of all that they have done, shew them
        the form of the house, and the fashion thereof, and the goings
        out thereof, and the comings in thereof, and all the forms
        thereof, and all the ordinances thereof, and all the forms
        thereof, and all the laws thereof: and write it in their
        sight, that they may keep the whole form thereof, and all the
        ordinances thereof, and do them.

043:012 This is the law of the house; Upon the top of the mountain the
        whole limit thereof round about shall be most holy. Behold,
        this is the law of the house.

043:013 And these are the measures of the altar after the cubits: The
        cubit is a cubit and an hand breadth; even the bottom shall be
        a cubit, and the breadth a cubit, and the border thereof by
        the edge thereof round about shall be a span: and this shall
        be the higher place of the altar.

043:014 And from the bottom upon the ground even to the lower settle
        shall be two cubits, and the breadth one cubit; and from the
        lesser settle even to the greater settle shall be four cubits,
        and the breadth one cubit.

043:015 So the altar shall be four cubits; and from the altar and
        upward shall be four horns.

043:016 And the altar shall be twelve cubits long, twelve broad,
        square in the four squares thereof.

043:017 And the settle shall be fourteen cubits long and fourteen
        broad in the four squares thereof; and the border about it
        shall be half a cubit; and the bottom thereof shall be a cubit
        about; and his stairs shall look toward the east.

043:018 And he said unto me, Son of man, thus saith the Lord GOD;
        These are the ordinances of the altar in the day when they
        shall make it, to offer burnt offerings thereon, and to
        sprinkle blood thereon.

043:019 And thou shalt give to the priests the Levites that be of the
        seed of Zadok, which approach unto me, to minister unto me,
        saith the Lord GOD, a young bullock for a sin offering.

043:020 And thou shalt take of the blood thereof, and put it on the
        four horns of it, and on the four corners of the settle, and
        upon the border round about: thus shalt thou cleanse and purge
        it.

043:021 Thou shalt take the bullock also of the sin offering, and he
        shall burn it in the appointed place of the house, without the
        sanctuary.

043:022 And on the second day thou shalt offer a kid of the goats
        without blemish for a sin offering; and they shall cleanse the
        altar, as they did cleanse it with the bullock.

043:023 When thou hast made an end of cleansing it, thou shalt offer a
        young bullock without blemish, and a ram out of the flock
        without blemish.

043:024 And thou shalt offer them before the LORD, and the priests
        shall cast salt upon them, and they shall offer them up for a
        burnt offering unto the LORD.

043:025 Seven days shalt thou prepare every day a goat for a sin
        offering: they shall also prepare a young bullock, and a ram
        out of the flock, without blemish.

043:026 Seven days shall they purge the altar and purify it; and they
        shall consecrate themselves.

043:027 And when these days are expired, it shall be, that upon the
        eighth day, and so forward, the priests shall make your burnt
        offerings upon the altar, and your peace offerings; and I will
        accept you, saith the Lord GOD.

044:001 Then he brought me back the way of the gate of the outward
        sanctuary which looketh toward the east; and it was shut.

044:002 Then said the LORD unto me; This gate shall be shut, it shall
        not be opened, and no man shall enter in by it; because the
        LORD, the God of Israel, hath entered in by it, therefore it
        shall be shut.

044:003 It is for the prince; the prince, he shall sit in it to eat
        bread before the LORD; he shall enter by the way of the porch
        of that gate, and shall go out by the way of the same.

044:004 Then brought he me the way of the north gate before the house:
        and I looked, and, behold, the glory of the LORD filled the
        house of the LORD: and I fell upon my face.

044:005 And the LORD said unto me, Son of man, mark well, and behold
        with thine eyes, and hear with thine ears all that I say unto
        thee concerning all the ordinances of the house of the LORD,
        and all the laws thereof; and mark well the entering in of the
        house, with every going forth of the sanctuary.

044:006 And thou shalt say to the rebellious, even to the house of
        Israel, Thus saith the Lord GOD; O ye house of Israel, let it
        suffice you of all your abominations,

044:007 In that ye have brought into my sanctuary strangers,
        uncircumcised in heart, and uncircumcised in flesh, to be in
        my sanctuary, to pollute it, even my house, when ye offer my
        bread, the fat and the blood, and they have broken my covenant
        because of all your abominations.

044:008 And ye have not kept the charge of mine holy things: but ye
        have set keepers of my charge in my sanctuary for yourselves.

044:009 Thus saith the Lord GOD; No stranger, uncircumcised in heart,
        nor uncircumcised in flesh, shall enter into my sanctuary, of
        any stranger that is among the children of Israel.

044:010 And the Levites that are gone away far from me, when Israel
        went astray, which went astray away from me after their idols;
        they shall even bear their iniquity.

044:011 Yet they shall be ministers in my sanctuary, having charge at
        the gates of the house, and ministering to the house: they
        shall slay the burnt offering and the sacrifice for the
        people, and they shall stand before them to minister unto
        them.

044:012 Because they ministered unto them before their idols, and
        caused the house of Israel to fall into iniquity; therefore
        have I lifted up mine hand against them, saith the Lord GOD,
        and they shall bear their iniquity.

044:013 And they shall not come near unto me, to do the office of a
        priest unto me, nor to come near to any of my holy things, in
        the most holy place: but they shall bear their shame, and
        their abominations which they have committed.

044:014 But I will make them keepers of the charge of the house, for
        all the service thereof, and for all that shall be done
        therein.

044:015 But the priests the Levites, the sons of Zadok, that kept the
        charge of my sanctuary when the children of Israel went astray
        from me, they shall come near to me to minister unto me, and
        they shall stand before me to offer unto me the fat and the
        blood, saith the Lord GOD:

044:016 They shall enter into my sanctuary, and they shall come near
        to my table, to minister unto me, and they shall keep my
        charge.

044:017 And it shall come to pass, that when they enter in at the
        gates of the inner court, they shall be clothed with linen
        garments; and no wool shall come upon them, whiles they
        minister in the gates of the inner court, and within.

044:018 They shall have linen bonnets upon their heads, and shall have
        linen breeches upon their loins; they shall not gird
        themselves with any thing that causeth sweat.

044:019 And when they go forth into the utter court, even into the
        utter court to the people, they shall put off their garments
        wherein they ministered, and lay them in the holy chambers,
        and they shall put on other garments; and they shall not
        sanctify the people with their garments.

044:020 Neither shall they shave their heads, nor suffer their locks
        to grow long; they shall only poll their heads.

044:021 Neither shall any priest drink wine, when they enter into the
        inner court.

044:022 Neither shall they take for their wives a widow, nor her that
        is put away: but they shall take maidens of the seed of the
        house of Israel, or a widow that had a priest before.

044:023 And they shall teach my people the difference between the holy
        and profane, and cause them to discern between the unclean and
        the clean.

044:024 And in controversy they shall stand in judgment; and they
        shall judge it according to my judgments: and they shall keep
        my laws and my statutes in all mine assemblies; and they shall
        hallow my sabbaths.

044:025 And they shall come at no dead person to defile themselves:
        but for father, or for mother, or for son, or for daughter,
        for brother, or for sister that hath had no husband, they may
        defile themselves.

044:026 And after he is cleansed, they shall reckon unto him seven
        days.

044:027 And in the day that he goeth into the sanctuary, unto the
        inner court, to minister in the sanctuary, he shall offer his
        sin offering, saith the Lord GOD.

044:028 And it shall be unto them for an inheritance: I am their
        inheritance: and ye shall give them no possession in Israel: I
        am their possession.

044:029 They shall eat the meat offering, and the sin offering, and
        the trespass offering: and every dedicated thing in Israel
        shall be theirs.

044:030 And the first of all the firstfruits of all things, and every
        oblation of all, of every sort of your oblations, shall be the
        priest's: ye shall also give unto the priest the first of your
        dough, that he may cause the blessing to rest in thine house.

044:031 The priests shall not eat of any thing that is dead of itself,
        or torn, whether it be fowl or beast.

045:001 Moreover, when ye shall divide by lot the land for
        inheritance, ye shall offer an oblation unto the LORD, an holy
        portion of the land: the length shall be the length of five
        and twenty thousand reeds, and the breadth shall be ten
        thousand. This shall be holy in all the borders thereof round
        about.

045:002 Of this there shall be for the sanctuary five hundred in
        length, with five hundred in breadth, square round about; and
        fifty cubits round about for the suburbs thereof.

045:003 And of this measure shalt thou measure the length of five and
        twenty thousand, and the breadth of ten thousand: and in it
        shall be the sanctuary and the most holy place.

045:004 The holy portion of the land shall be for the priests the
        ministers of the sanctuary, which shall come near to minister
        unto the LORD: and it shall be a place for their houses, and
        an holy place for the sanctuary.

045:005 And the five and twenty thousand of length, and the ten
        thousand of breadth shall also the Levites, the ministers of
        the house, have for themselves, for a possession for twenty
        chambers.

045:006 And ye shall appoint the possession of the city five thousand
        broad, and five and twenty thousand long, over against the
        oblation of the holy portion: it shall be for the whole house
        of Israel.

045:007 And a portion shall be for the prince on the one side and on
        the other side of the oblation of the holy portion, and of the
        possession of the city, before the oblation of the holy
        portion, and before the possession of the city, from the west
        side westward, and from the east side eastward: and the length
        shall be over against one of the portions, from the west
        border unto the east border.

045:008 In the land shall be his possession in Israel: and my princes
        shall no more oppress my people; and the rest of the land
        shall they give to the house of Israel according to their
        tribes.

045:009 Thus saith the Lord GOD; Let it suffice you, O princes of
        Israel: remove violence and spoil, and execute judgment and
        justice, take away your exactions from my people, saith the
        Lord GOD.

045:010 Ye shall have just balances, and a just ephah, and a just
        bath.

045:011 The ephah and the bath shall be of one measure, that the bath
        may contain the tenth part of an homer, and the ephah the
        tenth part of an homer: the measure thereof shall be after the
        homer.

045:012 And the shekel shall be twenty gerahs: twenty shekels, five
        and twenty shekels, fifteen shekels, shall be your maneh.

045:013 This is the oblation that ye shall offer; the sixth part of an
        ephah of an homer of wheat, and ye shall give the sixth part
        of an ephah of an homer of barley:

045:014 Concerning the ordinance of oil, the bath of oil, ye shall
        offer the tenth part of a bath out of the cor, which is an
        homer of ten baths; for ten baths are an homer:

045:015 And one lamb out of the flock, out of two hundred, out of the
        fat pastures of Israel; for a meat offering, and for a burnt
        offering, and for peace offerings, to make reconciliation for
        them, saith the Lord GOD.

045:016 All the people of the land shall give this oblation for the
        prince in Israel.

045:017 And it shall be the prince's part to give burnt offerings, and
        meat offerings, and drink offerings, in the feasts, and in the
        new moons, and in the sabbaths, in all solemnities of the
        house of Israel: he shall prepare the sin offering, and the
        meat offering, and the burnt offering, and the peace
        offerings, to make reconciliation for the house of Israel.

045:018 Thus saith the Lord GOD; In the first month, in the first day
        of the month, thou shalt take a young bullock without blemish,
        and cleanse the sanctuary:

045:019 And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering,
        and put it upon the posts of the house, and upon the four
        corners of the settle of the altar, and upon the posts of the
        gate of the inner court.

045:020 And so thou shalt do the seventh day of the month for every
        one that erreth, and for him that is simple: so shall ye
        reconcile the house.

045:021 In the first month, in the fourteenth day of the month, ye
        shall have the passover, a feast of seven days; unleavened
        bread shall be eaten.

045:022 And upon that day shall the prince prepare for himself and for
        all the people of the land a bullock for a sin offering.

045:023 And seven days of the feast he shall prepare a burnt offering
        to the LORD, seven bullocks and seven rams without blemish
        daily the seven days; and a kid of the goats daily for a sin
        offering.

045:024 And he shall prepare a meat offering of an ephah for a
        bullock, and an ephah for a ram, and an hin of oil for an
        ephah.

045:025 In the seventh month, in the fifteenth day of the month, shall
        he do the like in the feast of the seven days, according to
        the sin offering, according to the burnt offering, and
        according to the meat offering, and according to the oil.

046:001 Thus saith the Lord GOD; The gate of the inner court that
        looketh toward the east shall be shut the six working days;
        but on the sabbath it shall be opened, and in the day of the
        new moon it shall be opened.

046:002 And the prince shall enter by the way of the porch of that
        gate without, and shall stand by the post of the gate, and the
        priests shall prepare his burnt offering and his peace
        offerings, and he shall worship at the threshold of the gate:
        then he shall go forth; but the gate shall not be shut until
        the evening.

046:003 Likewise the people of the land shall worship at the door of
        this gate before the LORD in the sabbaths and in the new
        moons.

046:004 And the burnt offering that the prince shall offer unto the
        LORD in the sabbath day shall be six lambs without blemish,
        and a ram without blemish.

046:005 And the meat offering shall be an ephah for a ram, and the
        meat offering for the lambs as he shall be able to give, and
        an hin of oil to an ephah.

046:006 And in the day of the new moon it shall be a young bullock
        without blemish, and six lambs, and a ram: they shall be
        without blemish.

046:007 And he shall prepare a meat offering, an ephah for a bullock,
        and an ephah for a ram, and for the lambs according as his
        hand shall attain unto, and an hin of oil to an ephah.

046:008 And when the prince shall enter, he shall go in by the way of
        the porch of that gate, and he shall go forth by the way
        thereof.

046:009 But when the people of the land shall come before the LORD in
        the solemn feasts, he that entereth in by the way of the north
        gate to worship shall go out by the way of the south gate; and
        he that entereth by the way of the south gate shall go forth
        by the way of the north gate: he shall not return by the way
        of the gate whereby he came in, but shall go forth over
        against it.

046:010 And the prince in the midst of them, when they go in, shall go
        in; and when they go forth, shall go forth.

046:011 And in the feasts and in the solemnities the meat offering
        shall be an ephah to a bullock, and an ephah to a ram, and to
        the lambs as he is able to give, and an hin of oil to an
        ephah.

046:012 Now when the prince shall prepare a voluntary burnt offering
        or peace offerings voluntarily unto the LORD, one shall then
        open him the gate that looketh toward the east, and he shall
        prepare his burnt offering and his peace offerings, as he did
        on the sabbath day: then he shall go forth; and after his
        going forth one shall shut the gate.

046:013 Thou shalt daily prepare a burnt offering unto the LORD of a
        lamb of the first year without blemish: thou shalt prepare it
        every morning.

046:014 And thou shalt prepare a meat offering for it every morning,
        the sixth part of an ephah, and the third part of an hin of
        oil, to temper with the fine flour; a meat offering
        continually by a perpetual ordinance unto the LORD.

046:015 Thus shall they prepare the lamb, and the meat offering, and
        the oil, every morning for a continual burnt offering.

046:016 Thus saith the Lord GOD; If the prince give a gift unto any of
        his sons, the inheritance thereof shall be his sons'; it shall
        be their possession by inheritance.

046:017 But if he give a gift of his inheritance to one of his
        servants, then it shall be his to the year of liberty; after
        it shall return to the prince: but his inheritance shall be
        his sons' for them.

046:018 Moreover the prince shall not take of the people's inheritance
        by oppression, to thrust them out of their possession; but he
        shall give his sons inheritance out of his own possession:
        that my people be not scattered every man from his possession.

046:019 After he brought me through the entry, which was at the side
        of the gate, into the holy chambers of the priests, which
        looked toward the north: and, behold, there was a place on the
        two sides westward.

046:020 Then said he unto me, This is the place where the priests
        shall boil the trespass offering and the sin offering, where
        they shall bake the meat offering; that they bear them not out
        into the utter court, to sanctify the people.

046:021 Then he brought me forth into the utter court, and caused me
        to pass by the four corners of the court; and, behold, in
        every corner of the court there was a court.

046:022 In the four corners of the court there were courts joined of
        forty cubits long and thirty broad: these four corners were of
        one measure.

046:023 And there was a row of building round about in them, round
        about them four, and it was made with boiling places under the
        rows round about.

046:024 Then said he unto me, These are the places of them that boil,
        where the ministers of the house shall boil the sacrifice of
        the people.

047:001 Afterward he brought me again unto the door of the house; and,
        behold, waters issued out from under the threshold of the
        house eastward: for the forefront of the house stood toward
        the east, and the waters came down from under from the right
        side of the house, at the south side of the altar.

047:002 Then brought he me out of the way of the gate northward, and
        led me about the way without unto the utter gate by the way
        that looketh eastward; and, behold, there ran out waters on
        the right side.

047:003 And when the man that had the line in his hand went forth
        eastward, he measured a thousand cubits, and he brought me
        through the waters; the waters were to the ankles.

047:004 Again he measured a thousand, and brought me through the
        waters; the waters were to the knees. Again he measured a
        thousand, and brought me through; the waters were to the
        loins.

047:005 Afterward he measured a thousand; and it was a river that I
        could not pass over: for the waters were risen, waters to swim
        in, a river that could not be passed over.

047:006 And he said unto me, Son of man, hast thou seen this? Then he
        brought me, and caused me to return to the brink of the river.

047:007 Now when I had returned, behold, at the bank of the river were
        very many trees on the one side and on the other.

047:008 Then said he unto me, These waters issue out toward the east
        country, and go down into the desert, and go into the sea:
        which being brought forth into the sea, the waters shall be
        healed.

047:009 And it shall come to pass, that every thing that liveth, which
        moveth, whithersoever the rivers shall come, shall live: and
        there shall be a very great multitude of fish, because these
        waters shall come thither: for they shall be healed; and every
        thing shall live whither the river cometh.

047:010 And it shall come to pass, that the fishers shall stand upon
        it from Engedi even unto Eneglaim; they shall be a place to
        spread forth nets; their fish shall be according to their
        kinds, as the fish of the great sea, exceeding many.

047:011 But the miry places thereof and the marishes thereof shall not
        be healed; they shall be given to salt.

047:012 And by the river upon the bank thereof, on this side and on
        that side, shall grow all trees for meat, whose leaf shall not
        fade, neither shall the fruit thereof be consumed: it shall
        bring forth new fruit according to his months, because their
        waters they issued out of the sanctuary: and the fruit thereof
        shall be for meat, and the leaf thereof for medicine.

047:013 Thus saith the Lord GOD; This shall be the border, whereby ye
        shall inherit the land according to the twelve tribes of
        Israel: Joseph shall have two portions.

047:014 And ye shall inherit it, one as well as another: concerning
        the which I lifted up mine hand to give it unto your fathers:
        and this land shall fall unto you for inheritance.

047:015 And this shall be the border of the land toward the north
        side, from the great sea, the way of Hethlon, as men go to
        Zedad;

047:016 Hamath, Berothah, Sibraim, which is between the border of
        Damascus and the border of Hamath; Hazarhatticon, which is by
        the coast of Hauran.

047:017 And the border from the sea shall be Hazarenan, the border of
        Damascus, and the north northward, and the border of Hamath.
        And this is the north side.

047:018 And the east side ye shall measure from Hauran, and from
        Damascus, and from Gilead, and from the land of Israel by
        Jordan, from the border unto the east sea. And this is the
        east side.

047:019 And the south side southward, from Tamar even to the waters of
        strife in Kadesh, the river to the great sea. And this is the
        south side southward.

047:020 The west side also shall be the great sea from the border,
        till a man come over against Hamath. This is the west side.

047:021 So shall ye divide this land unto you according to the tribes
        of Israel.

047:022 And it shall come to pass, that ye shall divide it by lot for
        an inheritance unto you, and to the strangers that sojourn
        among you, which shall beget children among you: and they
        shall be unto you as born in the country among the children of
        Israel; they shall have inheritance with you among the tribes
        of Israel.

047:023 And it shall come to pass, that in what tribe the stranger
        sojourneth, there shall ye give him his inheritance, saith the
        Lord GOD.

048:001 Now these are the names of the tribes. From the north end to
        the coast of the way of Hethlon, as one goeth to Hamath,
        Hazarenan, the border of Damascus northward, to the coast of
        Hamath; for these are his sides east and west; a portion for
        Dan.

048:002 And by the border of Dan, from the east side unto the west
        side, a portion for Asher.

048:003 And by the border of Asher, from the east side even unto the
        west side, a portion for Naphtali.

048:004 And by the border of Naphtali, from the east side unto the
        west side, a portion for Manasseh.

048:005 And by the border of Manasseh, from the east side unto the
        west side, a portion for Ephraim.

048:006 And by the border of Ephraim, from the east side even unto the
        west side, a portion for Reuben.

048:007 And by the border of Reuben, from the east side unto the west
        side, a portion for Judah.

048:008 And by the border of Judah, from the east side unto the west
        side, shall be the offering which ye shall offer of five and
        twenty thousand reeds in breadth, and in length as one of the
        other parts, from the east side unto the west side: and the
        sanctuary shall be in the midst of it.

048:009 The oblation that ye shall offer unto the LORD shall be of
        five and twenty thousand in length, and of ten thousand in
        breadth.

048:010 And for them, even for the priests, shall be this holy
        oblation; toward the north five and twenty thousand in length,
        and toward the west ten thousand in breadth, and toward the
        east ten thousand in breadth, and toward the south five and
        twenty thousand in length: and the sanctuary of the LORD shall
        be in the midst thereof.

048:011 It shall be for the priests that are sanctified of the sons of
        Zadok; which have kept my charge, which went not astray when
        the children of Israel went astray, as the Levites went
        astray.

048:012 And this oblation of the land that is offered shall be unto
        them a thing most holy by the border of the Levites.

048:013 And over against the border of the priests the Levites shall
        have five and twenty thousand in length, and ten thousand in
        breadth: all the length shall be five and twenty thousand, and
        the breadth ten thousand.

048:014 And they shall not sell of it, neither exchange, nor alienate
        the firstfruits of the land: for it is holy unto the LORD.

048:015 And the five thousand, that are left in the breadth over
        against the five and twenty thousand, shall be a profane place
        for the city, for dwelling, and for suburbs: and the city
        shall be in the midst thereof.

048:016 And these shall be the measures thereof; the north side four
        thousand and five hundred, and the south side four thousand
        and five hundred, and on the east side four thousand and five
        hundred, and the west side four thousand and five hundred.

048:017 And the suburbs of the city shall be toward the north two
        hundred and fifty, and toward the south two hundred and fifty,
        and toward the east two hundred and fifty, and toward the west
        two hundred and fifty.

048:018 And the residue in length over against the oblation of the
        holy portion shall be ten thousand eastward, and ten thousand
        westward: and it shall be over against the oblation of the
        holy portion; and the increase thereof shall be for food unto
        them that serve the city.

048:019 And they that serve the city shall serve it out of all the
        tribes of Israel.

048:020 All the oblation shall be five and twenty thousand by five and
        twenty thousand: ye shall offer the holy oblation foursquare,
        with the possession of the city.

048:021 And the residue shall be for the prince, on the one side and
        on the other of the holy oblation, and of the possession of
        the city, over against the five and twenty thousand of the
        oblation toward the east border, and westward over against the
        five and twenty thousand toward the west border, over against
        the portions for the prince: and it shall be the holy
        oblation; and the sanctuary of the house shall be in the midst
        thereof.

048:022 Moreover from the possession of the Levites, and from the
        possession of the city, being in the midst of that which is
        the prince's, between the border of Judah and the border of
        Benjamin, shall be for the prince.

048:023 As for the rest of the tribes, from the east side unto the
        west side, Benjamin shall have a portion.

048:024 And by the border of Benjamin, from the east side unto the
        west side, Simeon shall have a portion.

048:025 And by the border of Simeon, from the east side unto the west
        side, Issachar a portion.

048:026 And by the border of Issachar, from the east side unto the
        west side, Zebulun a portion.

048:027 And by the border of Zebulun, from the east side unto the west
        side, Gad a portion.

048:028 And by the border of Gad, at the south side southward, the
        border shall be even from Tamar unto the waters of strife in
        Kadesh, and to the river toward the great sea.

048:029 This is the land which ye shall divide by lot unto the tribes
        of Israel for inheritance, and these are their portions, saith
        the Lord GOD.

048:030 And these are the goings out of the city on the north side,
        four thousand and five hundred measures.

048:031 And the gates of the city shall be after the names of the
        tribes of Israel: three gates northward; one gate of Reuben,
        one gate of Judah, one gate of Levi.

048:032 And at the east side four thousand and five hundred: and three
        gates; and one gate of Joseph, one gate of Benjamin, one gate
        of Dan.

048:033 And at the south side four thousand and five hundred measures:
        and three gates; one gate of Simeon, one gate of Issachar, one
        gate of Zebulun.

048:034 At the west side four thousand and five hundred, with their
        three gates; one gate of Gad, one gate of Asher, one gate of
        Naphtali.

048:035 It was round about eighteen thousand measures: and the name of
        the city from that day shall be, The LORD is there.

Book 27	Daniel

001:001 In the third year of the reign of Jehoiakim king of Judah came
        Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon unto Jerusalem, and besieged
        it.

001:002 And the Lord gave Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand, with
        part of the vessels of the house of God: which he carried into
        the land of Shinar to the house of his god; and he brought the
        vessels into the treasure house of his god.

001:003 And the king spake unto Ashpenaz the master of his eunuchs,
        that he should bring certain of the children of Israel, and of
        the king's seed, and of the princes;

001:004 Children in whom was no blemish, but well favoured, and
        skilful in all wisdom, and cunning in knowledge, and
        understanding science, and such as had ability in them to
        stand in the king's palace, and whom they might teach the
        learning and the tongue of the Chaldeans.

001:005 And the king appointed them a daily provision of the king's
        meat, and of the wine which he drank: so nourishing them three
        years, that at the end thereof they might stand before the
        king.

001:006 Now among these were of the children of Judah, Daniel,
        Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah:

001:007 Unto whom the prince of the eunuchs gave names: for he gave
        unto Daniel the name of Belteshazzar; and to Hananiah, of
        Shadrach; and to Mishael, of Meshach; and to Azariah, of
        Abednego.

001:008 But Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile
        himself with the portion of the king's meat, nor with the wine
        which he drank: therefore he requested of the prince of the
        eunuchs that he might not defile himself.

001:009 Now God had brought Daniel into favour and tender love with
        the prince of the eunuchs.

001:010 And the prince of the eunuchs said unto Daniel, I fear my lord
        the king, who hath appointed your meat and your drink: for why
        should he see your faces worse liking than the children which
        are of your sort? then shall ye make me endanger my head to
        the king.

001:011 Then said Daniel to Melzar, whom the prince of the eunuchs had
        set over Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah,

001:012 Prove thy servants, I beseech thee, ten days; and let them
        give us pulse to eat, and water to drink.

001:013 Then let our countenances be looked upon before thee, and the
        countenance of the children that eat of the portion of the
        king's meat: and as thou seest, deal with thy servants.

001:014 So he consented to them in this matter, and proved them ten
        days.

001:015 And at the end of ten days their countenances appeared fairer
        and fatter in flesh than all the children which did eat the
        portion of the king's meat.

001:016 Thus Melzar took away the portion of their meat, and the wine
        that they should drink; and gave them pulse.

001:017 As for these four children, God gave them knowledge and skill
        in all learning and wisdom: and Daniel had understanding in
        all visions and dreams.

001:018 Now at the end of the days that the king had said he should
        bring them in, then the prince of the eunuchs brought them in
        before Nebuchadnezzar.

001:019 And the king communed with them; and among them all was found
        none like Daniel, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah: therefore
        stood they before the king.

001:020 And in all matters of wisdom and understanding, that the king
        enquired of them, he found them ten times better than all the
        magicians and astrologers that were in all his realm.

001:021 And Daniel continued even unto the first year of king Cyrus.

002:001 And in the second year of the reign of Nebuchadnezzar
        Nebuchadnezzar dreamed dreams, wherewith his spirit was
        troubled, and his sleep brake from him.

002:002 Then the king commanded to call the magicians, and the
        astrologers, and the sorcerers, and the Chaldeans, for to shew
        the king his dreams. So they came and stood before the king.

002:003 And the king said unto them, I have dreamed a dream, and my
        spirit was troubled to know the dream.

002:004 Then spake the Chaldeans to the king in Syriack, O king, live
        for ever: tell thy servants the dream, and we will shew the
        interpretation.

002:005 The king answered and said to the Chaldeans, The thing is gone
        from me: if ye will not make known unto me the dream, with the
        interpretation thereof, ye shall be cut in pieces, and your
        houses shall be made a dunghill.

002:006 But if ye shew the dream, and the interpretation thereof, ye
        shall receive of me gifts and rewards and great honour:
        therefore shew me the dream, and the interpretation thereof.

002:007 They answered again and said, Let the king tell his servants
        the dream, and we will shew the interpretation of it.

002:008 The king answered and said, I know of certainty that ye would
        gain the time, because ye see the thing is gone from me.

002:009 But if ye will not make known unto me the dream, there is but
        one decree for you: for ye have prepared lying and corrupt
        words to speak before me, till the time be changed: therefore
        tell me the dream, and I shall know that ye can shew me the
        interpretation thereof.

002:010 The Chaldeans answered before the king, and said, There is not
        a man upon the earth that can shew the king's matter:
        therefore there is no king, lord, nor ruler, that asked such
        things at any magician, or astrologer, or Chaldean.

002:011 And it is a rare thing that the king requireth, and there is
        none other that can shew it before the king, except the gods,
        whose dwelling is not with flesh.

002:012 For this cause the king was angry and very furious, and
        commanded to destroy all the wise men of Babylon.

002:013 And the decree went forth that the wise men should be slain;
        and they sought Daniel and his fellows to be slain.

002:014 Then Daniel answered with counsel and wisdom to Arioch the
        captain of the king's guard, which was gone forth to slay the
        wise men of Babylon:

002:015 He answered and said to Arioch the king's captain, Why is the
        decree so hasty from the king? Then Arioch made the thing
        known to Daniel.

002:016 Then Daniel went in, and desired of the king that he would
        give him time, and that he would shew the king the
        interpretation.

002:017 Then Daniel went to his house, and made the thing known to
        Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah, his companions:

002:018 That they would desire mercies of the God of heaven concerning
        this secret; that Daniel and his fellows should not perish
        with the rest of the wise men of Babylon.

002:019 Then was the secret revealed unto Daniel in a night vision.
        Then Daniel blessed the God of heaven.

002:020 Daniel answered and said, Blessed be the name of God for ever
        and ever: for wisdom and might are his:

002:021 And he changeth the times and the seasons: he removeth kings,
        and setteth up kings: he giveth wisdom unto the wise, and
        knowledge to them that know understanding:

002:022 He revealeth the deep and secret things: he knoweth what is in
        the darkness, and the light dwelleth with him.

002:023 I thank thee, and praise thee, O thou God of my fathers, who
        hast given me wisdom and might, and hast made known unto me
        now what we desired of thee: for thou hast now made known unto
        us the king's matter.

002:024 Therefore Daniel went in unto Arioch, whom the king had
        ordained to destroy the wise men of Babylon: he went and said
        thus unto him; Destroy not the wise men of Babylon: bring me
        in before the king, and I will shew unto the king the
        interpretation.

002:025 Then Arioch brought in Daniel before the king in haste, and
        said thus unto him, I have found a man of the captives of
        Judah, that will make known unto the king the interpretation.

002:026 The king answered and said to Daniel, whose name was
        Belteshazzar, Art thou able to make known unto me the dream
        which I have seen, and the interpretation thereof?

002:027 Daniel answered in the presence of the king, and said, The
        secret which the king hath demanded cannot the wise men, the
        astrologers, the magicians, the soothsayers, shew unto the
        king;

002:028 But there is a God in heaven that revealeth secrets, and
        maketh known to the king Nebuchadnezzar what shall be in the
        latter days. Thy dream, and the visions of thy head upon thy
        bed, are these;

002:029 As for thee, O king, thy thoughts came into thy mind upon thy
        bed, what should come to pass hereafter: and he that revealeth
        secrets maketh known to thee what shall come to pass.

002:030 But as for me, this secret is not revealed to me for any
        wisdom that I have more than any living, but for their sakes
        that shall make known the interpretation to the king, and that
        thou mightest know the thoughts of thy heart.

002:031 Thou, O king, sawest, and behold a great image. This great
        image, whose brightness was excellent, stood before thee; and
        the form thereof was terrible.

002:032 This image's head was of fine gold, his breast and his arms of
        silver, his belly and his thighs of brass,

002:033 His legs of iron, his feet part of iron and part of clay.

002:034 Thou sawest till that a stone was cut out without hands, which
        smote the image upon his feet that were of iron and clay, and
        brake them to pieces.

002:035 Then was the iron, the clay, the brass, the silver, and the
        gold, broken to pieces together, and became like the chaff of
        the summer threshingfloors; and the wind carried them away,
        that no place was found for them: and the stone that smote the
        image became a great mountain, and filled the whole earth.

002:036 This is the dream; and we will tell the interpretation thereof
        before the king.

002:037 Thou, O king, art a king of kings: for the God of heaven hath
        given thee a kingdom, power, and strength, and glory.

002:038 And wheresoever the children of men dwell, the beasts of the
        field and the fowls of the heaven hath he given into thine
        hand, and hath made thee ruler over them all. Thou art this
        head of gold.

002:039 And after thee shall arise another kingdom inferior to thee,
        and another third kingdom of brass, which shall bear rule over
        all the earth.

002:040 And the fourth kingdom shall be strong as iron: forasmuch as
        iron breaketh in pieces and subdueth all things: and as iron
        that breaketh all these, shall it break in pieces and bruise.

002:041 And whereas thou sawest the feet and toes, part of potters'
        clay, and part of iron, the kingdom shall be divided; but
        there shall be in it of the strength of the iron, forasmuch as
        thou sawest the iron mixed with miry clay.

002:042 And as the toes of the feet were part of iron, and part of
        clay, so the kingdom shall be partly strong, and partly
        broken.

002:043 And whereas thou sawest iron mixed with miry clay, they shall
        mingle themselves with the seed of men: but they shall not
        cleave one to another, even as iron is not mixed with clay.

002:044 And in the days of these kings shall the God of heaven set up
        a kingdom, which shall never be destroyed: and the kingdom
        shall not be left to other people, but it shall break in
        pieces and consume all these kingdoms, and it shall stand for
        ever.

002:045 Forasmuch as thou sawest that the stone was cut out of the
        mountain without hands, and that it brake in pieces the iron,
        the brass, the clay, the silver, and the gold; the great God
        hath made known to the king what shall come to pass hereafter:
        and the dream is certain, and the interpretation thereof sure.

002:046 Then the king Nebuchadnezzar fell upon his face, and
        worshipped Daniel, and commanded that they should offer an
        oblation and sweet odours unto him.

002:047 The king answered unto Daniel, and said, Of a truth it is,
        that your God is a God of gods, and a Lord of kings, and a
        revealer of secrets, seeing thou couldest reveal this secret.

002:048 Then the king made Daniel a great man, and gave him many great
        gifts, and made him ruler over the whole province of Babylon,
        and chief of the governors over all the wise men of Babylon.

002:049 Then Daniel requested of the king, and he set Shadrach,
        Meshach, and Abednego, over the affairs of the province of
        Babylon: but Daniel sat in the gate of the king.

003:001 Nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold, whose height
        was threescore cubits, and the breadth thereof six cubits: he
        set it up in the plain of Dura, in the province of Babylon.

003:002 Then Nebuchadnezzar the king sent to gather together the
        princes, the governors, and the captains, the judges, the
        treasurers, the counsellors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers
        of the provinces, to come to the dedication of the image which
        Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up.

003:003 Then the princes, the governors, and captains, the judges, the
        treasurers, the counsellors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers
        of the provinces, were gathered together unto the dedication
        of the image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up; and they
        stood before the image that Nebuchadnezzar had set up.

003:004 Then an herald cried aloud, To you it is commanded, O people,
        nations, and languages,

003:005 That at what time ye hear the sound of the cornet, flute,
        harp, sackbut, psaltery, dulcimer, and all kinds of musick, ye
        fall down and worship the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the
        king hath set up:

003:006 And whoso falleth not down and worshippeth shall the same hour
        be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace.

003:007 Therefore at that time, when all the people heard the sound of
        the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and all kinds of
        musick, all the people, the nations, and the languages, fell
        down and worshipped the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the
        king had set up.

003:008 Wherefore at that time certain Chaldeans came near, and
        accused the Jews.

003:009 They spake and said to the king Nebuchadnezzar, O king, live
        for ever.

003:010 Thou, O king, hast made a decree, that every man that shall
        hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery,
        and dulcimer, and all kinds of musick, shall fall down and
        worship the golden image:

003:011 And whoso falleth not down and worshippeth, that he should be
        cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace.

003:012 There are certain Jews whom thou hast set over the affairs of
        the province of Babylon, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego;
        these men, O king, have not regarded thee: they serve not thy
        gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up.

003:013 Then Nebuchadnezzar in his rage and fury commanded to bring
        Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. Then they brought these men
        before the king.

003:014 Nebuchadnezzar spake and said unto them, Is it true, O
        Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, do not ye serve my gods, nor
        worship the golden image which I have set up?

003:015 Now if ye be ready that at what time ye hear the sound of the
        cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and dulcimer, and all
        kinds of musick, ye fall down and worship the image which I
        have made; well: but if ye worship not, ye shall be cast the
        same hour into the midst of a burning fiery furnace; and who
        is that God that shall deliver you out of my hands?

003:016 Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, answered and said to the
        king, O Nebuchadnezzar, we are not careful to answer thee in
        this matter.

003:017 If it be so, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from
        the burning fiery furnace, and he will deliver us out of thine
        hand, O king.

003:018 But if not, be it known unto thee, O king, that we will not
        serve thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast
        set up.

003:019 Then was Nebuchadnezzar full of fury, and the form of his
        visage was changed against Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego:
        therefore he spake, and commanded that they should heat the
        furnace one seven times more than it was wont to be heated.

003:020 And he commanded the most mighty men that were in his army to
        bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, and to cast them into
        the burning fiery furnace.

003:021 Then these men were bound in their coats, their hosen, and
        their hats, and their other garments, and were cast into the
        midst of the burning fiery furnace.

003:022 Therefore because the king's commandment was urgent, and the
        furnace exceeding hot, the flames of the fire slew those men
        that took up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego.

003:023 And these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, fell
        down bound into the midst of the burning fiery furnace.

003:024 Then Nebuchadnezzar the king was astonied, and rose up in
        haste, and spake, and said unto his counsellors, Did not we
        cast three men bound into the midst of the fire? They answered
        and said unto the king, True, O king.

003:025 He answered and said, Lo, I see four men loose, walking in the
        midst of the fire, and they have no hurt; and the form of the
        fourth is like the Son of God.

003:026 Then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the mouth of the burning
        fiery furnace, and spake, and said, Shadrach, Meshach, and
        Abednego, ye servants of the most high God, come forth, and
        come hither. Then Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, came forth
        of the midst of the fire.

003:027 And the princes, governors, and captains, and the king's
        counsellors, being gathered together, saw these men, upon
        whose bodies the fire had no power, nor was an hair of their
        head singed, neither were their coats changed, nor the smell
        of fire had passed on them.

003:028 Then Nebuchadnezzar spake, and said, Blessed be the God of
        Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, who hath sent his angel, and
        delivered his servants that trusted in him, and have changed
        the king's word, and yielded their bodies, that they might not
        serve nor worship any god, except their own God.

003:029 Therefore I make a decree, That every people, nation, and
        language, which speak any thing amiss against the God of
        Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, shall be cut in pieces, and
        their houses shall be made a dunghill: because there is no
        other God that can deliver after this sort.

003:030 Then the king promoted Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, in the
        province of Babylon.

004:001 Nebuchadnezzar the king, unto all people, nations, and
        languages, that dwell in all the earth; Peace be multiplied
        unto you.

004:002 I thought it good to shew the signs and wonders that the high
        God hath wrought toward me.

004:003 How great are his signs! and how mighty are his wonders! his
        kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and his dominion is from
        generation to generation.

004:004 I Nebuchadnezzar was at rest in mine house, and flourishing in
        my palace:

004:005 I saw a dream which made me afraid, and the thoughts upon my
        bed and the visions of my head troubled me.

004:006 Therefore made I a decree to bring in all the wise men of
        Babylon before me, that they might make known unto me the
        interpretation of the dream.

004:007 Then came in the magicians, the astrologers, the Chaldeans,
        and the soothsayers: and I told the dream before them; but
        they did not make known unto me the interpretation thereof.

004:008 But at the last Daniel came in before me, whose name was
        Belteshazzar, according to the name of my God, and in whom is
        the spirit of the holy gods: and before him I told the dream,
        saying,

004:009 O Belteshazzar, master of the magicians, because I know that
        the spirit of the holy gods is in thee, and no secret
        troubleth thee, tell me the visions of my dream that I have
        seen, and the interpretation thereof.

004:010 Thus were the visions of mine head in my bed; I saw, and
        behold a tree in the midst of the earth, and the height
        thereof was great.

004:011 The tree grew, and was strong, and the height thereof reached
        unto heaven, and the sight thereof to the end of all the
        earth:

004:012 The leaves thereof were fair, and the fruit thereof much, and
        in it was meat for all: the beasts of the field had shadow
        under it, and the fowls of the heaven dwelt in the boughs
        thereof, and all flesh was fed of it.

004:013 I saw in the visions of my head upon my bed, and, behold, a
        watcher and an holy one came down from heaven;

004:014 He cried aloud, and said thus, Hew down the tree, and cut off
        his branches, shake off his leaves, and scatter his fruit: let
        the beasts get away from under it, and the fowls from his
        branches:

004:015 Nevertheless leave the stump of his roots in the earth, even
        with a band of iron and brass, in the tender grass of the
        field; and let it be wet with the dew of heaven, and let his
        portion be with the beasts in the grass of the earth:

004:016 Let his heart be changed from man's, and let a beast's heart
        be given unto him; and let seven times pass over him.

004:017 This matter is by the decree of the watchers, and the demand
        by the word of the holy ones: to the intent that the living
        may know that the most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and
        giveth it to whomsoever he will, and setteth up over it the
        basest of men.

004:018 This dream I king Nebuchadnezzar have seen. Now thou, O
        Belteshazzar, declare the interpretation thereof, forasmuch as
        all the wise men of my kingdom are not able to make known unto
        me the interpretation: but thou art able; for the spirit of
        the holy gods is in thee.

004:019 Then Daniel, whose name was Belteshazzar, was astonied for one
        hour, and his thoughts troubled him. The king spake, and said,
        Belteshazzar, let not the dream, or the interpretation
        thereof, trouble thee. Belteshazzar answered and said, My
        lord, the dream be to them that hate thee, and the
        interpretation thereof to thine enemies.

004:020 The tree that thou sawest, which grew, and was strong, whose
        height reached unto the heaven, and the sight thereof to all
        the earth;

004:021 Whose leaves were fair, and the fruit thereof much, and in it
        was meat for all; under which the beasts of the field dwelt,
        and upon whose branches the fowls of the heaven had their
        habitation:

004:022 It is thou, O king, that art grown and become strong: for thy
        greatness is grown, and reacheth unto heaven, and thy dominion
        to the end of the earth.

004:023 And whereas the king saw a watcher and an holy one coming down
        from heaven, and saying, Hew the tree down, and destroy it;
        yet leave the stump of the roots thereof in the earth, even
        with a band of iron and brass, in the tender grass of the
        field; and let it be wet with the dew of heaven, and let his
        portion be with the beasts of the field, till seven times pass
        over him;

004:024 This is the interpretation, O king, and this is the decree of
        the most High, which is come upon my lord the king:

004:025 That they shall drive thee from men, and thy dwelling shall be
        with the beasts of the field, and they shall make thee to eat
        grass as oxen, and they shall wet thee with the dew of heaven,
        and seven times shall pass over thee, till thou know that the
        most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to
        whomsoever he will.

004:026 And whereas they commanded to leave the stump of the tree
        roots; thy kingdom shall be sure unto thee, after that thou
        shalt have known that the heavens do rule.

004:027 Wherefore, O king, let my counsel be acceptable unto thee, and
        break off thy sins by righteousness, and thine iniquities by
        shewing mercy to the poor; if it may be a lengthening of thy
        tranquillity.

004:028 All this came upon the king Nebuchadnezzar.

004:029 At the end of twelve months he walked in the palace of the
        kingdom of Babylon.

004:030 The king spake, and said, Is not this great Babylon, that I
        have built for the house of the kingdom by the might of my
        power, and for the honour of my majesty?

004:031 While the word was in the king's mouth, there fell a voice
        from heaven, saying, O king Nebuchadnezzar, to thee it is
        spoken; The kingdom is departed from thee.

004:032 And they shall drive thee from men, and thy dwelling shall be
        with the beasts of the field: they shall make thee to eat
        grass as oxen, and seven times shall pass over thee, until
        thou know that the most High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and
        giveth it to whomsoever he will.

004:033 The same hour was the thing fulfilled upon Nebuchadnezzar: and
        he was driven from men, and did eat grass as oxen, and his
        body was wet with the dew of heaven, till his hairs were grown
        like eagles' feathers, and his nails like birds' claws.

004:034 And at the end of the days I Nebuchadnezzar lifted up mine
        eyes unto heaven, and mine understanding returned unto me, and
        I blessed the most High, and I praised and honoured him that
        liveth for ever, whose dominion is an everlasting dominion,
        and his kingdom is from generation to generation:

004:035 And all the inhabitants of the earth are reputed as nothing:
        and he doeth according to his will in the army of heaven, and
        among the inhabitants of the earth: and none can stay his
        hand, or say unto him, What doest thou?

004:036 At the same time my reason returned unto me; and for the glory
        of my kingdom, mine honour and brightness returned unto me;
        and my counsellors and my lords sought unto me; and I was
        established in my kingdom, and excellent majesty was added
        unto me.

004:037 Now I Nebuchadnezzar praise and extol and honour the King of
        heaven, all whose works are truth, and his ways judgment: and
        those that walk in pride he is able to abase.

005:001 Belshazzar the king made a great feast to a thousand of his
        lords, and drank wine before the thousand.

005:002 Belshazzar, whiles he tasted the wine, commanded to bring the
        golden and silver vessels which his father Nebuchadnezzar had
        taken out of the temple which was in Jerusalem; that the king,
        and his princes, his wives, and his concubines, might drink
        therein.

005:003 Then they brought the golden vessels that were taken out of
        the temple of the house of God which was at Jerusalem; and the
        king, and his princes, his wives, and his concubines, drank in
        them.

005:004 They drank wine, and praised the gods of gold, and of silver,
        of brass, of iron, of wood, and of stone.

005:005 In the same hour came forth fingers of a man's hand, and wrote
        over against the candlestick upon the plaister of the wall of
        the king's palace: and the king saw the part of the hand that
        wrote.

005:006 Then the king's countenance was changed, and his thoughts
        troubled him, so that the joints of his loins were loosed, and
        his knees smote one against another.

005:007 The king cried aloud to bring in the astrologers, the
        Chaldeans, and the soothsayers. And the king spake, and said
        to the wise men of Babylon, Whosoever shall read this writing,
        and shew me the interpretation thereof, shall be clothed with
        scarlet, and have a chain of gold about his neck, and shall be
        the third ruler in the kingdom.

005:008 Then came in all the king's wise men: but they could not read
        the writing, nor make known to the king the interpretation
        thereof.

005:009 Then was king Belshazzar greatly troubled, and his countenance
        was changed in him, and his lords were astonied.

005:010 Now the queen by reason of the words of the king and his lords
        came into the banquet house: and the queen spake and said, O
        king, live for ever: let not thy thoughts trouble thee, nor
        let thy countenance be changed:

005:011 There is a man in thy kingdom, in whom is the spirit of the
        holy gods; and in the days of thy father light and
        understanding and wisdom, like the wisdom of the gods, was
        found in him; whom the king Nebuchadnezzar thy father, the
        king, I say, thy father, made master of the magicians,
        astrologers, Chaldeans, and soothsayers;

005:012 Forasmuch as an excellent spirit, and knowledge, and
        understanding, interpreting of dreams, and shewing of hard
        sentences, and dissolving of doubts, were found in the same
        Daniel, whom the king named Belteshazzar: now let Daniel be
        called, and he will shew the interpretation.

005:013 Then was Daniel brought in before the king. And the king spake
        and said unto Daniel, Art thou that Daniel, which art of the
        children of the captivity of Judah, whom the king my father
        brought out of Jewry?

005:014 I have even heard of thee, that the spirit of the gods is in
        thee, and that light and understanding and excellent wisdom is
        found in thee.

005:015 And now the wise men, the astrologers, have been brought in
        before me, that they should read this writing, and make known
        unto me the interpretation thereof: but they could not shew
        the interpretation of the thing:

005:016 And I have heard of thee, that thou canst make
        interpretations, and dissolve doubts: now if thou canst read
        the writing, and make known to me the interpretation thereof,
        thou shalt be clothed with scarlet, and have a chain of gold
        about thy neck, and shalt be the third ruler in the kingdom.

005:017 Then Daniel answered and said before the king, Let thy gifts
        be to thyself, and give thy rewards to another; yet I will
        read the writing unto the king, and make known to him the
        interpretation.

005:018 O thou king, the most high God gave Nebuchadnezzar thy father
        a kingdom, and majesty, and glory, and honour:

005:019 And for the majesty that he gave him, all people, nations, and
        languages, trembled and feared before him: whom he would he
        slew; and whom he would he kept alive; and whom he would he
        set up; and whom he would he put down.

005:020 But when his heart was lifted up, and his mind hardened in
        pride, he was deposed from his kingly throne, and they took
        his glory from him:

005:021 And he was driven from the sons of men; and his heart was made
        like the beasts, and his dwelling was with the wild asses:
        they fed him with grass like oxen, and his body was wet with
        the dew of heaven; till he knew that the most high God ruled
        in the kingdom of men, and that he appointeth over it
        whomsoever he will.

005:022 And thou his son, O Belshazzar, hast not humbled thine heart,
        though thou knewest all this;

005:023 But hast lifted up thyself against the Lord of heaven; and
        they have brought the vessels of his house before thee, and
        thou, and thy lords, thy wives, and thy concubines, have drunk
        wine in them; and thou hast praised the gods of silver, and
        gold, of brass, iron, wood, and stone, which see not, nor
        hear, nor know: and the God in whose hand thy breath is, and
        whose are all thy ways, hast thou not glorified:

005:024 Then was the part of the hand sent from him; and this writing
        was written.

005:025 And this is the writing that was written, MENE, MENE, TEKEL,
        UPHARSIN.

005:026 This is the interpretation of the thing: MENE; God hath
        numbered thy kingdom, and finished it.

005:027 TEKEL; Thou art weighed in the balances, and art found
        wanting.

005:028 PERES; Thy kingdom is divided, and given to the Medes and
        Persians.

005:029 Then commanded Belshazzar, and they clothed Daniel with
        scarlet, and put a chain of gold about his neck, and made a
        proclamation concerning him, that he should be the third ruler
        in the kingdom.

005:030 In that night was Belshazzar the king of the Chaldeans slain.

005:031 And Darius the Median took the kingdom, being about threescore
        and two years old.

006:001 It pleased Darius to set over the kingdom an hundred and
        twenty princes, which should be over the whole kingdom;

006:002 And over these three presidents; of whom Daniel was first:
        that the princes might give accounts unto them, and the king
        should have no damage.

006:003 Then this Daniel was preferred above the presidents and
        princes, because an excellent spirit was in him; and the king
        thought to set him over the whole realm.

006:004 Then the presidents and princes sought to find occasion
        against Daniel concerning the kingdom; but they could find
        none occasion nor fault; forasmuch as he was faithful, neither
        was there any error or fault found in him.

006:005 Then said these men, We shall not find any occasion against
        this Daniel, except we find it against him concerning the law
        of his God.

006:006 Then these presidents and princes assembled together to the
        king, and said thus unto him, King Darius, live for ever.

006:007 All the presidents of the kingdom, the governors, and the
        princes, the counsellors, and the captains, have consulted
        together to establish a royal statute, and to make a firm
        decree, that whosoever shall ask a petition of any God or man
        for thirty days, save of thee, O king, he shall be cast into
        the den of lions.

006:008 Now, O king, establish the decree, and sign the writing, that
        it be not changed, according to the law of the Medes and
        Persians, which altereth not.

006:009 Wherefore king Darius signed the writing and the decree.

006:010 Now when Daniel knew that the writing was signed, he went into
        his house; and his windows being open in his chamber toward
        Jerusalem, he kneeled upon his knees three times a day, and
        prayed, and gave thanks before his God, as he did aforetime.

006:011 Then these men assembled, and found Daniel praying and making
        supplication before his God.

006:012 Then they came near, and spake before the king concerning the
        king's decree; Hast thou not signed a decree, that every man
        that shall ask a petition of any God or man within thirty
        days, save of thee, O king, shall be cast into the den of
        lions? The king answered and said, The thing is true,
        according to the law of the Medes and Persians, which altereth
        not.

006:013 Then answered they and said before the king, That Daniel,
        which is of the children of the captivity of Judah, regardeth
        not thee, O king, nor the decree that thou hast signed, but
        maketh his petition three times a day.

006:014 Then the king, when he heard these words, was sore displeased
        with himself, and set his heart on Daniel to deliver him: and
        he laboured till the going down of the sun to deliver him.

006:015 Then these men assembled unto the king, and said unto the
        king, Know, O king, that the law of the Medes and Persians is,
        That no decree nor statute which the king establisheth may be
        changed.

006:016 Then the king commanded, and they brought Daniel, and cast him
        into the den of lions. Now the king spake and said unto
        Daniel, Thy God whom thou servest continually, he will deliver
        thee.

006:017 And a stone was brought, and laid upon the mouth of the den;
        and the king sealed it with his own signet, and with the
        signet of his lords; that the purpose might not be changed
        concerning Daniel.

006:018 Then the king went to his palace, and passed the night
        fasting: neither were instruments of musick brought before
        him: and his sleep went from him.

006:019 Then the king arose very early in the morning, and went in
        haste unto the den of lions.

006:020 And when he came to the den, he cried with a lamentable voice
        unto Daniel: and the king spake and said to Daniel, O Daniel,
        servant of the living God, is thy God, whom thou servest
        continually, able to deliver thee from the lions?

006:021 Then said Daniel unto the king, O king, live for ever.

006:022 My God hath sent his angel, and hath shut the lions' mouths,
        that they have not hurt me: forasmuch as before him innocency
        was found in me; and also before thee, O king, have I done no
        hurt.

006:023 Then was the king exceedingly glad for him, and commanded that
        they should take Daniel up out of the den. So Daniel was taken
        up out of the den, and no manner of hurt was found upon him,
        because he believed in his God.

006:024 And the king commanded, and they brought those men which had
        accused Daniel, and they cast them into the den of lions,
        them, their children, and their wives; and the lions had the
        mastery of them, and brake all their bones in pieces or ever
        they came at the bottom of the den.

006:025 Then king Darius wrote unto all people, nations, and
        languages, that dwell in all the earth; Peace be multiplied
        unto you.

006:026 I make a decree, That in every dominion of my kingdom men
        tremble and fear before the God of Daniel: for he is the
        living God, and stedfast for ever, and his kingdom that which
        shall not be destroyed, and his dominion shall be even unto
        the end.

006:027 He delivereth and rescueth, and he worketh signs and wonders
        in heaven and in earth, who hath delivered Daniel from the
        power of the lions.

006:028 So this Daniel prospered in the reign of Darius, and in the
        reign of Cyrus the Persian.

007:001 In the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon Daniel had a
        dream and visions of his head upon his bed: then he wrote the
        dream, and told the sum of the matters.

007:002 Daniel spake and said, I saw in my vision by night, and,
        behold, the four winds of the heaven strove upon the great
        sea.

007:003 And four great beasts came up from the sea, diverse one from
        another.

007:004 The first was like a lion, and had eagle's wings: I beheld
        till the wings thereof were plucked, and it was lifted up from
        the earth, and made stand upon the feet as a man, and a man's
        heart was given to it.

007:005 And behold another beast, a second, like to a bear, and it
        raised up itself on one side, and it had three ribs in the
        mouth of it between the teeth of it: and they said thus unto
        it, Arise, devour much flesh.

007:006 After this I beheld, and lo another, like a leopard, which had
        upon the back of it four wings of a fowl; the beast had also
        four heads; and dominion was given to it.

007:007 After this I saw in the night visions, and behold a fourth
        beast, dreadful and terrible, and strong exceedingly; and it
        had great iron teeth: it devoured and brake in pieces, and
        stamped the residue with the feet of it: and it was diverse
        from all the beasts that were before it; and it had ten horns.

007:008 I considered the horns, and, behold, there came up among them
        another little horn, before whom there were three of the first
        horns plucked up by the roots: and, behold, in this horn were
        eyes like the eyes of man, and a mouth speaking great things.

007:009 I beheld till the thrones were cast down, and the Ancient of
        days did sit, whose garment was white as snow, and the hair of
        his head like the pure wool: his throne was like the fiery
        flame, and his wheels as burning fire.

007:010 A fiery stream issued and came forth from before him: thousand
        thousands ministered unto him, and ten thousand times ten
        thousand stood before him: the judgment was set, and the books
        were opened.

007:011 I beheld then because of the voice of the great words which
        the horn spake: I beheld even till the beast was slain, and
        his body destroyed, and given to the burning flame.

007:012 As concerning the rest of the beasts, they had their dominion
        taken away: yet their lives were prolonged for a season and
        time.

007:013 I saw in the night visions, and, behold, one like the Son of
        man came with the clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancient of
        days, and they brought him near before him.

007:014 And there was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom,
        that all people, nations, and languages, should serve him: his
        dominion is an everlasting dominion, which shall not pass
        away, and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed.

007:015 I Daniel was grieved in my spirit in the midst of my body, and
        the visions of my head troubled me.

007:016 I came near unto one of them that stood by, and asked him the
        truth of all this. So he told me, and made me know the
        interpretation of the things.

007:017 These great beasts, which are four, are four kings, which
        shall arise out of the earth.

007:018 But the saints of the most High shall take the kingdom, and
        possess the kingdom for ever, even for ever and ever.

007:019 Then I would know the truth of the fourth beast, which was
        diverse from all the others, exceeding dreadful, whose teeth
        were of iron, and his nails of brass; which devoured, brake in
        pieces, and stamped the residue with his feet;

007:020 And of the ten horns that were in his head, and of the other
        which came up, and before whom three fell; even of that horn
        that had eyes, and a mouth that spake very great things, whose
        look was more stout than his fellows.

007:021 I beheld, and the same horn made war with the saints, and
        prevailed against them;

007:022 Until the Ancient of days came, and judgment was given to the
        saints of the most High; and the time came that the saints
        possessed the kingdom.

007:023 Thus he said, The fourth beast shall be the fourth kingdom
        upon earth, which shall be diverse from all kingdoms, and
        shall devour the whole earth, and shall tread it down, and
        break it in pieces.

007:024 And the ten horns out of this kingdom are ten kings that shall
        arise: and another shall rise after them; and he shall be
        diverse from the first, and he shall subdue three kings.

007:025 And he shall speak great words against the most High, and
        shall wear out the saints of the most High, and think to
        change times and laws: and they shall be given into his hand
        until a time and times and the dividing of time.

007:026 But the judgment shall sit, and they shall take away his
        dominion, to consume and to destroy it unto the end.

007:027 And the kingdom and dominion, and the greatness of the kingdom
        under the whole heaven, shall be given to the people of the
        saints of the most High, whose kingdom is an everlasting
        kingdom, and all dominions shall serve and obey him.

007:028 Hitherto is the end of the matter. As for me Daniel, my
        cogitations much troubled me, and my countenance changed in
        me: but I kept the matter in my heart.

008:001 In the third year of the reign of king Belshazzar a vision
        appeared unto me, even unto me Daniel, after that which
        appeared unto me at the first.

008:002 And I saw in a vision; and it came to pass, when I saw, that I
        was at Shushan in the palace, which is in the province of
        Elam; and I saw in a vision, and I was by the river of Ulai.

008:003 Then I lifted up mine eyes, and saw, and, behold, there stood
        before the river a ram which had two horns: and the two horns
        were high; but one was higher than the other, and the higher
        came up last.

008:004 I saw the ram pushing westward, and northward, and southward;
        so that no beasts might stand before him, neither was there
        any that could deliver out of his hand; but he did according
        to his will, and became great.

008:005 And as I was considering, behold, an he goat came from the
        west on the face of the whole earth, and touched not the
        ground: and the goat had a notable horn between his eyes.

008:006 And he came to the ram that had two horns, which I had seen
        standing before the river, and ran unto him in the fury of his
        power.

008:007 And I saw him come close unto the ram, and he was moved with
        choler against him, and smote the ram, and brake his two
        horns: and there was no power in the ram to stand before him,
        but he cast him down to the ground, and stamped upon him: and
        there was none that could deliver the ram out of his hand.

008:008 Therefore the he goat waxed very great: and when he was
        strong, the great horn was broken; and for it came up four
        notable ones toward the four winds of heaven.

008:009 And out of one of them came forth a little horn, which waxed
        exceeding great, toward the south, and toward the east, and
        toward the pleasant land.

008:010 And it waxed great, even to the host of heaven; and it cast
        down some of the host and of the stars to the ground, and
        stamped upon them.

008:011 Yea, he magnified himself even to the prince of the host, and
        by him the daily sacrifice was taken away, and the place of
        the sanctuary was cast down.

008:012 And an host was given him against the daily sacrifice by
        reason of transgression, and it cast down the truth to the
        ground; and it practised, and prospered.

008:013 Then I heard one saint speaking, and another saint said unto
        that certain saint which spake, How long shall be the vision
        concerning the daily sacrifice, and the transgression of
        desolation, to give both the sanctuary and the host to be
        trodden under foot?

008:014 And he said unto me, Unto two thousand and three hundred days;
        then shall the sanctuary be cleansed.

008:015 And it came to pass, when I, even I Daniel, had seen the
        vision, and sought for the meaning, then, behold, there stood
        before me as the appearance of a man.

008:016 And I heard a man's voice between the banks of Ulai, which
        called, and said, Gabriel, make this man to understand the
        vision.

008:017 So he came near where I stood: and when he came, I was afraid,
        and fell upon my face: but he said unto me, Understand, O son
        of man: for at the time of the end shall be the vision.

008:018 Now as he was speaking with me, I was in a deep sleep on my
        face toward the ground: but he touched me, and set me upright.

008:019 And he said, Behold, I will make thee know what shall be in
        the last end of the indignation: for at the time appointed the
        end shall be.

008:020 The ram which thou sawest having two horns are the kings of
        Media and Persia.

008:021 And the rough goat is the king of Grecia: and the great horn
        that is between his eyes is the first king.

008:022 Now that being broken, whereas four stood up for it, four
        kingdoms shall stand up out of the nation, but not in his
        power.

008:023 And in the latter time of their kingdom, when the
        transgressors are come to the full, a king of fierce
        countenance, and understanding dark sentences, shall stand up.

008:024 And his power shall be mighty, but not by his own power: and
        he shall destroy wonderfully, and shall prosper, and practise,
        and shall destroy the mighty and the holy people.

008:025 And through his policy also he shall cause craft to prosper in
        his hand; and he shall magnify himself in his heart, and by
        peace shall destroy many: he shall also stand up against the
        Prince of princes; but he shall be broken without hand.

008:026 And the vision of the evening and the morning which was told
        is true: wherefore shut thou up the vision; for it shall be
        for many days.

008:027 And I Daniel fainted, and was sick certain days; afterward I
        rose up, and did the king's business; and I was astonished at
        the vision, but none understood it.

009:001 In the first year of Darius the son of Ahasuerus, of the seed
        of the Medes, which was made king over the realm of the
        Chaldeans;

009:002 In the first year of his reign I Daniel understood by books
        the number of the years, whereof the word of the LORD came to
        Jeremiah the prophet, that he would accomplish seventy years
        in the desolations of Jerusalem.

009:003 And I set my face unto the Lord God, to seek by prayer and
        supplications, with fasting, and sackcloth, and ashes:

009:004 And I prayed unto the LORD my God, and made my confession, and
        said, O Lord, the great and dreadful God, keeping the covenant
        and mercy to them that love him, and to them that keep his
        commandments;

009:005 We have sinned, and have committed iniquity, and have done
        wickedly, and have rebelled, even by departing from thy
        precepts and from thy judgments:

009:006 Neither have we hearkened unto thy servants the prophets,
        which spake in thy name to our kings, our princes, and our
        fathers, and to all the people of the land.

009:007 O LORD, righteousness belongeth unto thee, but unto us
        confusion of faces, as at this day; to the men of Judah, and
        to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and unto all Israel, that are
        near, and that are far off, through all the countries whither
        thou hast driven them, because of their trespass that they
        have trespassed against thee.

009:008 O Lord, to us belongeth confusion of face, to our kings, to
        our princes, and to our fathers, because we have sinned
        against thee.

009:009 To the Lord our God belong mercies and forgivenesses, though
        we have rebelled against him;

009:010 Neither have we obeyed the voice of the LORD our God, to walk
        in his laws, which he set before us by his servants the
        prophets.

009:011 Yea, all Israel have transgressed thy law, even by departing,
        that they might not obey thy voice; therefore the curse is
        poured upon us, and the oath that is written in the law of
        Moses the servant of God, because we have sinned against him.

009:012 And he hath confirmed his words, which he spake against us,
        and against our judges that judged us, by bringing upon us a
        great evil: for under the whole heaven hath not been done as
        hath been done upon Jerusalem.

009:013 As it is written in the law of Moses, all this evil is come
        upon us: yet made we not our prayer before the LORD our God,
        that we might turn from our iniquities, and understand thy
        truth.

009:014 Therefore hath the LORD watched upon the evil, and brought it
        upon us: for the LORD our God is righteous in all his works
        which he doeth: for we obeyed not his voice.

009:015 And now, O Lord our God, that hast brought thy people forth
        out of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand, and hast gotten
        thee renown, as at this day; we have sinned, we have done
        wickedly.

009:016 O LORD, according to all thy righteousness, I beseech thee,
        let thine anger and thy fury be turned away from thy city
        Jerusalem, thy holy mountain: because for our sins, and for
        the iniquities of our fathers, Jerusalem and thy people are
        become a reproach to all that are about us.

009:017 Now therefore, O our God, hear the prayer of thy servant, and
        his supplications, and cause thy face to shine upon thy
        sanctuary that is desolate, for the Lord's sake.

009:018 O my God, incline thine ear, and hear; open thine eyes, and
        behold our desolations, and the city which is called by thy
        name: for we do not present our supplications before thee for
        our righteousnesses, but for thy great mercies.

009:019 O Lord, hear; O Lord, forgive; O Lord, hearken and do; defer
        not, for thine own sake, O my God: for thy city and thy people
        are called by thy name.

009:020 And whiles I was speaking, and praying, and confessing my sin
        and the sin of my people Israel, and presenting my
        supplication before the LORD my God for the holy mountain of
        my God;

009:021 Yea, whiles I was speaking in prayer, even the man Gabriel,
        whom I had seen in the vision at the beginning, being caused
        to fly swiftly, touched me about the time of the evening
        oblation.

009:022 And he informed me, and talked with me, and said, O Daniel, I
        am now come forth to give thee skill and understanding.

009:023 At the beginning of thy supplications the commandment came
        forth, and I am come to shew thee; for thou art greatly
        beloved: therefore understand the matter, and consider the
        vision.

009:024 Seventy weeks are determined upon thy people and upon thy holy
        city, to finish the transgression, and to make an end of sins,
        and to make reconciliation for iniquity, and to bring in
        everlasting righteousness, and to seal up the vision and
        prophecy, and to anoint the most Holy.

009:025 Know therefore and understand, that from the going forth of
        the commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem unto the
        Messiah the Prince shall be seven weeks, and threescore and
        two weeks: the street shall be built again, and the wall, even
        in troublous times.

009:026 And after threescore and two weeks shall Messiah be cut off,
        but not for himself: and the people of the prince that shall
        come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary; and the end
        thereof shall be with a flood, and unto the end of the war
        desolations are determined.

009:027 And he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week: and
        in the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the
        oblation to cease, and for the overspreading of abominations
        he shall make it desolate, even until the consummation, and
        that determined shall be poured upon the desolate.

010:001 In the third year of Cyrus king of Persia a thing was revealed
        unto Daniel, whose name was called Belteshazzar; and the thing
        was true, but the time appointed was long: and he understood
        the thing, and had understanding of the vision.

010:002 In those days I Daniel was mourning three full weeks.

010:003 I ate no pleasant bread, neither came flesh nor wine in my
        mouth, neither did I anoint myself at all, till three whole
        weeks were fulfilled.

010:004 And in the four and twentieth day of the first month, as I was
        by the side of the great river, which is Hiddekel;

010:005 Then I lifted up mine eyes, and looked, and behold a certain
        man clothed in linen, whose loins were girded with fine gold
        of Uphaz:

010:006 His body also was like the beryl, and his face as the
        appearance of lightning, and his eyes as lamps of fire, and
        his arms and his feet like in colour to polished brass, and
        the voice of his words like the voice of a multitude.

010:007 And I Daniel alone saw the vision: for the men that were with
        me saw not the vision; but a great quaking fell upon them, so
        that they fled to hide themselves.

010:008 Therefore I was left alone, and saw this great vision, and
        there remained no strength in me: for my comeliness was turned
        in me into corruption, and I retained no strength.

010:009 Yet heard I the voice of his words: and when I heard the voice
        of his words, then was I in a deep sleep on my face, and my
        face toward the ground.

010:010 And, behold, an hand touched me, which set me upon my knees
        and upon the palms of my hands.

010:011 And he said unto me, O Daniel, a man greatly beloved,
        understand the words that I speak unto thee, and stand
        upright: for unto thee am I now sent. And when he had spoken
        this word unto me, I stood trembling.

010:012 Then said he unto me, Fear not, Daniel: for from the first day
        that thou didst set thine heart to understand, and to chasten
        thyself before thy God, thy words were heard, and I am come
        for thy words.

010:013 But the prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me one and
        twenty days: but, lo, Michael, one of the chief princes, came
        to help me; and I remained there with the kings of Persia.

010:014 Now I am come to make thee understand what shall befall thy
        people in the latter days: for yet the vision is for many
        days.

010:015 And when he had spoken such words unto me, I set my face
        toward the ground, and I became dumb.

010:016 And, behold, one like the similitude of the sons of men
        touched my lips: then I opened my mouth, and spake, and said
        unto him that stood before me, O my lord, by the vision my
        sorrows are turned upon me, and I have retained no strength.

010:017 For how can the servant of this my lord talk with this my
        lord? for as for me, straightway there remained no strength in
        me, neither is there breath left in me.

010:018 Then there came again and touched me one like the appearance
        of a man, and he strengthened me,

010:019 And said, O man greatly beloved, fear not: peace be unto thee,
        be strong, yea, be strong. And when he had spoken unto me, I
        was strengthened, and said, Let my lord speak; for thou hast
        strengthened me.

010:020 Then said he, Knowest thou wherefore I come unto thee? and now
        will I return to fight with the prince of Persia: and when I
        am gone forth, lo, the prince of Grecia shall come.

010:021 But I will shew thee that which is noted in the scripture of
        truth: and there is none that holdeth with me in these things,
        but Michael your prince.

011:001 Also I in the first year of Darius the Mede, even I, stood to
        confirm and to strengthen him.

011:002 And now will I shew thee the truth. Behold, there shall stand
        up yet three kings in Persia; and the fourth shall be far
        richer than they all: and by his strength through his riches
        he shall stir up all against the realm of Grecia.

011:003 And a mighty king shall stand up, that shall rule with great
        dominion, and do according to his will.

011:004 And when he shall stand up, his kingdom shall be broken, and
        shall be divided toward the four winds of heaven; and not to
        his posterity, nor according to his dominion which he ruled:
        for his kingdom shall be plucked up, even for others beside
        those.

011:005 And the king of the south shall be strong, and one of his
        princes; and he shall be strong above him, and have dominion;
        his dominion shall be a great dominion.

011:006 And in the end of years they shall join themselves together;
        for the king's daughter of the south shall come to the king of
        the north to make an agreement: but she shall not retain the
        power of the arm; neither shall he stand, nor his arm: but she
        shall be given up, and they that brought her, and he that
        begat her, and he that strengthened her in these times.

011:007 But out of a branch of her roots shall one stand up in his
        estate, which shall come with an army, and shall enter into
        the fortress of the king of the north, and shall deal against
        them, and shall prevail:

011:008 And shall also carry captives into Egypt their gods, with
        their princes, and with their precious vessels of silver and
        of gold; and he shall continue more years than the king of the
        north.

011:009 So the king of the south shall come into his kingdom, and
        shall return into his own land.

011:010 But his sons shall be stirred up, and shall assemble a
        multitude of great forces: and one shall certainly come, and
        overflow, and pass through: then shall he return, and be
        stirred up, even to his fortress.

011:011 And the king of the south shall be moved with choler, and
        shall come forth and fight with him, even with the king of the
        north: and he shall set forth a great multitude; but the
        multitude shall be given into his hand.

011:012 And when he hath taken away the multitude, his heart shall be
        lifted up; and he shall cast down many ten thousands: but he
        shall not be strengthened by it.

011:013 For the king of the north shall return, and shall set forth a
        multitude greater than the former, and shall certainly come
        after certain years with a great army and with much riches.

011:014 And in those times there shall many stand up against the king
        of the south: also the robbers of thy people shall exalt
        themselves to establish the vision; but they shall fall.

011:015 So the king of the north shall come, and cast up a mount, and
        take the most fenced cities: and the arms of the south shall
        not withstand, neither his chosen people, neither shall there
        be any strength to withstand.

011:016 But he that cometh against him shall do according to his own
        will, and none shall stand before him: and he shall stand in
        the glorious land, which by his hand shall be consumed.

011:017 He shall also set his face to enter with the strength of his
        whole kingdom, and upright ones with him; thus shall he do:
        and he shall give him the daughter of women, corrupting her:
        but she shall not stand on his side, neither be for him.

011:018 After this shall he turn his face unto the isles, and shall
        take many: but a prince for his own behalf shall cause the
        reproach offered by him to cease; without his own reproach he
        shall cause it to turn upon him.

011:019 Then he shall turn his face toward the fort of his own land:
        but he shall stumble and fall, and not be found.

011:020 Then shall stand up in his estate a raiser of taxes in the
        glory of the kingdom: but within few days he shall be
        destroyed, neither in anger, nor in battle.

011:021 And in his estate shall stand up a vile person, to whom they
        shall not give the honour of the kingdom: but he shall come in
        peaceably, and obtain the kingdom by flatteries.

011:022 And with the arms of a flood shall they be overflown from
        before him, and shall be broken; yea, also the prince of the
        covenant.

011:023 And after the league made with him he shall work deceitfully:
        for he shall come up, and shall become strong with a small
        people.

011:024 He shall enter peaceably even upon the fattest places of the
        province; and he shall do that which his fathers have not
        done, nor his fathers' fathers; he shall scatter among them
        the prey, and spoil, and riches: yea, and he shall forecast
        his devices against the strong holds, even for a time.

011:025 And he shall stir up his power and his courage against the
        king of the south with a great army; and the king of the south
        shall be stirred up to battle with a very great and mighty
        army; but he shall not stand: for they shall forecast devices
        against him.

011:026 Yea, they that feed of the portion of his meat shall destroy
        him, and his army shall overflow: and many shall fall down
        slain.

011:027 And both of these kings' hearts shall be to do mischief, and
        they shall speak lies at one table; but it shall not prosper:
        for yet the end shall be at the time appointed.

011:028 Then shall he return into his land with great riches; and his
        heart shall be against the holy covenant; and he shall do
        exploits, and return to his own land.

011:029 At the time appointed he shall return, and come toward the
        south; but it shall not be as the former, or as the latter.

011:030 For the ships of Chittim shall come against him: therefore he
        shall be grieved, and return, and have indignation against the
        holy covenant: so shall he do; he shall even return, and have
        intelligence with them that forsake the holy covenant.

011:031 And arms shall stand on his part, and they shall pollute the
        sanctuary of strength, and shall take away the daily
        sacrifice, and they shall place the abomination that maketh
        desolate.

011:032 And such as do wickedly against the covenant shall he corrupt
        by flatteries: but the people that do know their God shall be
        strong, and do exploits.

011:033 And they that understand among the people shall instruct many:
        yet they shall fall by the sword, and by flame, by captivity,
        and by spoil, many days.

011:034 Now when they shall fall, they shall be holpen with a little
        help: but many shall cleave to them with flatteries.

011:035 And some of them of understanding shall fall, to try them, and
        to purge, and to make them white, even to the time of the end:
        because it is yet for a time appointed.

011:036 And the king shall do according to his will; and he shall
        exalt himself, and magnify himself above every god, and shall
        speak marvellous things against the God of gods, and shall
        prosper till the indignation be accomplished: for that that is
        determined shall be done.

011:037 Neither shall he regard the God of his fathers, nor the desire
        of women, nor regard any god: for he shall magnify himself
        above all.

011:038 But in his estate shall he honour the God of forces: and a god
        whom his fathers knew not shall he honour with gold, and
        silver, and with precious stones, and pleasant things.

011:039 Thus shall he do in the most strong holds with a strange god,
        whom he shall acknowledge and increase with glory: and he
        shall cause them to rule over many, and shall divide the land
        for gain.

011:040 And at the time of the end shall the king of the south push at
        him: and the king of the north shall come against him like a
        whirlwind, with chariots, and with horsemen, and with many
        ships; and he shall enter into the countries, and shall
        overflow and pass over.

011:041 He shall enter also into the glorious land, and many countries
        shall be overthrown: but these shall escape out of his hand,
        even Edom, and Moab, and the chief of the children of Ammon.

011:042 He shall stretch forth his hand also upon the countries: and
        the land of Egypt shall not escape.

011:043 But he shall have power over the treasures of gold and of
        silver, and over all the precious things of Egypt: and the
        Libyans and the Ethiopians shall be at his steps.

011:044 But tidings out of the east and out of the north shall trouble
        him: therefore he shall go forth with great fury to destroy,
        and utterly to make away many.

011:045 And he shall plant the tabernacles of his palace between the
        seas in the glorious holy mountain; yet he shall come to his
        end, and none shall help him.

012:001 And at that time shall Michael stand up, the great prince
        which standeth for the children of thy people: and there shall
        be a time of trouble, such as never was since there was a
        nation even to that same time: and at that time thy people
        shall be delivered, every one that shall be found written in
        the book.

012:002 And many of them that sleep in the dust of the earth shall
        awake, some to everlasting life, and some to shame and
        everlasting contempt.

012:003 And they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the
        firmament; and they that turn many to righteousness as the
        stars for ever and ever.

012:004 But thou, O Daniel, shut up the words, and seal the book, even
        to the time of the end: many shall run to and fro, and
        knowledge shall be increased.

012:005 Then I Daniel looked, and, behold, there stood other two, the
        one on this side of the bank of the river, and the other on
        that side of the bank of the river.

012:006 And one said to the man clothed in linen, which was upon the
        waters of the river, How long shall it be to the end of these
        wonders?

012:007 And I heard the man clothed in linen, which was upon the
        waters of the river, when he held up his right hand and his
        left hand unto heaven, and sware by him that liveth for ever
        that it shall be for a time, times, and an half; and when he
        shall have accomplished to scatter the power of the holy
        people, all these things shall be finished.

012:008 And I heard, but I understood not: then said I, O my Lord,
        what shall be the end of these things?

012:009 And he said, Go thy way, Daniel: for the words are closed up
        and sealed till the time of the end.

012:010 Many shall be purified, and made white, and tried; but the
        wicked shall do wickedly: and none of the wicked shall
        understand; but the wise shall understand.

012:011 And from the time that the daily sacrifice shall be taken
        away, and the abomination that maketh desolate set up, there
        shall be a thousand two hundred and ninety days.

012:012 Blessed is he that waiteth, and cometh to the thousand three
        hundred and five and thirty days.

012:013 But go thou thy way till the end be: for thou shalt rest, and
        stand in thy lot at the end of the days.

Book 28	Hosea

001:001 The word of the LORD that came unto Hosea, the son of Beeri,
        in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of
        Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash, king of
        Israel.

001:002 The beginning of the word of the LORD by Hosea. And the LORD
        said to Hosea, Go, take unto thee a wife of whoredoms and
        children of whoredoms: for the land hath committed great
        whoredom, departing from the LORD.

001:003 So he went and took Gomer the daughter of Diblaim; which
        conceived, and bare him a son.

001:004 And the LORD said unto him, Call his name Jezreel; for yet a
        little while, and I will avenge the blood of Jezreel upon the
        house of Jehu, and will cause to cease the kingdom of the
        house of Israel.

001:005 And it shall come to pass at that day, that I will break the
        bow of Israel, in the valley of Jezreel.

001:006 And she conceived again, and bare a daughter. And God said
        unto him, Call her name Loruhamah: for I will no more have
        mercy upon the house of Israel; but I will utterly take them
        away.

001:007 But I will have mercy upon the house of Judah, and will save
        them by the LORD their God, and will not save them by bow, nor
        by sword, nor by battle, by horses, nor by horsemen.

001:008 Now when she had weaned Loruhamah, she conceived, and bare a
        son.

001:009 Then said God, Call his name Loammi: for ye are not my people,
        and I will not be your God.

001:010 Yet the number of the children of Israel shall be as the sand
        of the sea, which cannot be measured nor numbered; and it
        shall come to pass, that in the place where it was said unto
        them, Ye are not my people, there it shall be said unto them,
        Ye are the sons of the living God.

001:011 Then shall the children of Judah and the children of Israel be
        gathered together, and appoint themselves one head, and they
        shall come up out of the land: for great shall be the day of
        Jezreel.

002:001 Say ye unto your brethren, Ammi; and to your sisters, Ruhamah.

002:002 Plead with your mother, plead: for she is not my wife, neither
        am I her husband: let her therefore put away her whoredoms out
        of her sight, and her adulteries from between her breasts;

002:003 Lest I strip her naked, and set her as in the day that she was
        born, and make her as a wilderness, and set her like a dry
        land, and slay her with thirst.

002:004 And I will not have mercy upon her children; for they be the
        children of whoredoms.

002:005 For their mother hath played the harlot: she that conceived
        them hath done shamefully: for she said, I will go after my
        lovers, that give me my bread and my water, my wool and my
        flax, mine oil and my drink.

002:006 Therefore, behold, I will hedge up thy way with thorns, and
        make a wall, that she shall not find her paths.

002:007 And she shall follow after her lovers, but she shall not
        overtake them; and she shall seek them, but shall not find
        them: then shall she say, I will go and return to my first
        husband; for then was it better with me than now.

002:008 For she did not know that I gave her corn, and wine, and oil,
        and multiplied her silver and gold, which they prepared for
        Baal.

002:009 Therefore will I return, and take away my corn in the time
        thereof, and my wine in the season thereof, and will recover
        my wool and my flax given to cover her nakedness.

002:010 And now will I discover her lewdness in the sight of her
        lovers, and none shall deliver her out of mine hand.

002:011 I will also cause all her mirth to cease, her feast days, her
        new moons, and her sabbaths, and all her solemn feasts.

002:012 And I will destroy her vines and her fig trees, whereof she
        hath said, These are my rewards that my lovers have given me:
        and I will make them a forest, and the beasts of the field
        shall eat them.

002:013 And I will visit upon her the days of Baalim, wherein she
        burned incense to them, and she decked herself with her
        earrings and her jewels, and she went after her lovers, and
        forgat me, saith the LORD.

002:014 Therefore, behold, I will allure her, and bring her into the
        wilderness, and speak comfortably unto her.

002:015 And I will give her her vineyards from thence, and the valley
        of Achor for a door of hope: and she shall sing there, as in
        the days of her youth, and as in the day when she came up out
        of the land of Egypt.

002:016 And it shall be at that day, saith the LORD, that thou shalt
        call me Ishi; and shalt call me no more Baali.

002:017 For I will take away the names of Baalim out of her mouth, and
        they shall no more be remembered by their name.

002:018 And in that day will I make a covenant for them with the
        beasts of the field and with the fowls of heaven, and with the
        creeping things of the ground: and I will break the bow and
        the sword and the battle out of the earth, and will make them
        to lie down safely.

002:019 And I will betroth thee unto me for ever; yea, I will betroth
        thee unto me in righteousness, and in judgment, and in
        lovingkindness, and in mercies.

002:020 I will even betroth thee unto me in faithfulness: and thou
        shalt know the LORD.

002:021 And it shall come to pass in that day, I will hear, saith the
        LORD, I will hear the heavens, and they shall hear the earth;

002:022 And the earth shall hear the corn, and the wine, and the oil;
        and they shall hear Jezreel.

002:023 And I will sow her unto me in the earth; and I will have mercy
        upon her that had not obtained mercy; and I will say to them
        which were not my people, Thou art my people; and they shall
        say, Thou art my God.

003:001 Then said the LORD unto me, Go yet, love a woman beloved of
        her friend, yet an adulteress, according to the love of the
        LORD toward the children of Israel, who look to other gods,
        and love flagons of wine.

003:002 So I bought her to me for fifteen pieces of silver, and for an
        homer of barley, and an half homer of barley:

003:003 And I said unto her, Thou shalt abide for me many days; thou
        shalt not play the harlot, and thou shalt not be for another
        man: so will I also be for thee.

003:004 For the children of Israel shall abide many days without a
        king, and without a prince, and without a sacrifice, and
        without an image, and without an ephod, and without teraphim:

003:005 Afterward shall the children of Israel return, and seek the
        LORD their God, and David their king; and shall fear the LORD
        and his goodness in the latter days.

004:001 Hear the word of the LORD, ye children of Israel: for the LORD
        hath a controversy with the inhabitants of the land, because
        there is no truth, nor mercy, nor knowledge of God in the
        land.

004:002 By swearing, and lying, and killing, and stealing, and
        committing adultery, they break out, and blood toucheth blood.

004:003 Therefore shall the land mourn, and every one that dwelleth
        therein shall languish, with the beasts of the field, and with
        the fowls of heaven; yea, the fishes of the sea also shall be
        taken away.

004:004 Yet let no man strive, nor reprove another: for thy people are
        as they that strive with the priest.

004:005 Therefore shalt thou fall in the day, and the prophet also
        shall fall with thee in the night, and I will destroy thy
        mother.

004:006 My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge: because thou
        hast rejected knowledge, I will also reject thee, that thou
        shalt be no priest to me: seeing thou hast forgotten the law
        of thy God, I will also forget thy children.

004:007 As they were increased, so they sinned against me: therefore
        will I change their glory into shame.

004:008 They eat up the sin of my people, and they set their heart on
        their iniquity.

004:009 And there shall be, like people, like priest: and I will
        punish them for their ways, and reward them their doings.

004:010 For they shall eat, and not have enough: they shall commit
        whoredom, and shall not increase: because they have left off
        to take heed to the LORD.

004:011 Whoredom and wine and new wine take away the heart.

004:012 My people ask counsel at their stocks, and their staff
        declareth unto them: for the spirit of whoredoms hath caused
        them to err, and they have gone a whoring from under their
        God.

004:013 They sacrifice upon the tops of the mountains, and burn
        incense upon the hills, under oaks and poplars and elms,
        because the shadow thereof is good: therefore your daughters
        shall commit whoredom, and your spouses shall commit adultery.

004:014 I will not punish your daughters when they commit whoredom,
        nor your spouses when they commit adultery: for themselves are
        separated with whores, and they sacrifice with harlots:
        therefore the people that doth not understand shall fall.

004:015 Though thou, Israel, play the harlot, yet let not Judah
        offend; and come not ye unto Gilgal, neither go ye up to
        Bethaven, nor swear, The LORD liveth.

004:016 For Israel slideth back as a backsliding heifer: now the LORD
        will feed them as a lamb in a large place.

004:017 Ephraim is joined to idols: let him alone.

004:018 Their drink is sour: they have committed whoredom continually:
        her rulers with shame do love, Give ye.

004:019 The wind hath bound her up in her wings, and they shall be
        ashamed because of their sacrifices.

005:001 Hear ye this, O priests; and hearken, ye house of Israel; and
        give ye ear, O house of the king; for judgment is toward you,
        because ye have been a snare on Mizpah, and a net spread upon
        Tabor.

005:002 And the revolters are profound to make slaughter, though I
        have been a rebuker of them all.

005:003 I know Ephraim, and Israel is not hid from me: for now, O
        Ephraim, thou committest whoredom, and Israel is defiled.

005:004 They will not frame their doings to turn unto their God: for
        the spirit of whoredoms is in the midst of them, and they have
        not known the LORD.

005:005 And the pride of Israel doth testify to his face: therefore
        shall Israel and Ephraim fall in their iniquity: Judah also
        shall fall with them.

005:006 They shall go with their flocks and with their herds to seek
        the LORD; but they shall not find him; he hath withdrawn
        himself from them.

005:007 They have dealt treacherously against the LORD: for they have
        begotten strange children: now shall a month devour them with
        their portions.

005:008 Blow ye the cornet in Gibeah, and the trumpet in Ramah: cry
        aloud at Bethaven, after thee, O Benjamin.

005:009 Ephraim shall be desolate in the day of rebuke: among the
        tribes of Israel have I made known that which shall surely be.

005:010 The princes of Judah were like them that remove the bound:
        therefore I will pour out my wrath upon them like water.

005:011 Ephraim is oppressed and broken in judgment, because he
        willingly walked after the commandment.

005:012 Therefore will I be unto Ephraim as a moth, and to the house
        of Judah as rottenness.

005:013 When Ephraim saw his sickness, and Judah saw his wound, then
        went Ephraim to the Assyrian, and sent to king Jareb: yet
        could he not heal you, nor cure you of your wound.

005:014 For I will be unto Ephraim as a lion, and as a young lion to
        the house of Judah: I, even I, will tear and go away; I will
        take away, and none shall rescue him.

005:015 I will go and return to my place, till they acknowledge their
        offence, and seek my face: in their affliction they will seek
        me early.

006:001 Come, and let us return unto the LORD: for he hath torn, and
        he will heal us; he hath smitten, and he will bind us up.

006:002 After two days will he revive us: in the third day he will
        raise us up, and we shall live in his sight.

006:003 Then shall we know, if we follow on to know the LORD: his
        going forth is prepared as the morning; and he shall come unto
        us as the rain, as the latter and former rain unto the earth.

006:004 O Ephraim, what shall I do unto thee? O Judah, what shall I do
        unto thee? for your goodness is as a morning cloud, and as the
        early dew it goeth away.

006:005 Therefore have I hewed them by the prophets; I have slain them
        by the words of my mouth: and thy judgments are as the light
        that goeth forth.

006:006 For I desired mercy, and not sacrifice; and the knowledge of
        God more than burnt offerings.

006:007 But they like men have transgressed the covenant: there have
        they dealt treacherously against me.

006:008 Gilead is a city of them that work iniquity, and is polluted
        with blood.

006:009 And as troops of robbers wait for a man, so the company of
        priests murder in the way by consent: for they commit
        lewdness.

006:010 I have seen an horrible thing in the house of Israel: there is
        the whoredom of Ephraim, Israel is defiled.

006:011 Also, O Judah, he hath set an harvest for thee, when I
        returned the captivity of my people.

007:001 When I would have healed Israel, then the iniquity of Ephraim
        was discovered, and the wickedness of Samaria: for they commit
        falsehood; and the thief cometh in, and the troop of robbers
        spoileth without.

007:002 And they consider not in their hearts that I remember all
        their wickedness: now their own doings have beset them about;
        they are before my face.

007:003 They make the king glad with their wickedness, and the princes
        with their lies.

007:004 They are all adulterers, as an oven heated by the baker, who
        ceaseth from raising after he hath kneaded the dough, until it
        be leavened.

007:005 In the day of our king the princes have made him sick with
        bottles of wine; he stretched out his hand with scorners.

007:006 For they have made ready their heart like an oven, whiles they
        lie in wait: their baker sleepeth all the night; in the
        morning it burneth as a flaming fire.

007:007 They are all hot as an oven, and have devoured their judges;
        all their kings are fallen: there is none among them that
        calleth unto me.

007:008 Ephraim, he hath mixed himself among the people; Ephraim is a
        cake not turned.

007:009 Strangers have devoured his strength, and he knoweth it not:
        yea, gray hairs are here and there upon him, yet he knoweth
        not.

007:010 And the pride of Israel testifieth to his face: and they do
        not return to the LORD their God, nor seek him for all this.

007:011 Ephraim also is like a silly dove without heart: they call to
        Egypt, they go to Assyria.

007:012 When they shall go, I will spread my net upon them; I will
        bring them down as the fowls of the heaven; I will chastise
        them, as their congregation hath heard.

007:013 Woe unto them! for they have fled from me: destruction unto
        them! because they have transgressed against me: though I have
        redeemed them, yet they have spoken lies against me.

007:014 And they have not cried unto me with their heart, when they
        howled upon their beds: they assemble themselves for corn and
        wine, and they rebel against me.

007:015 Though I have bound and strengthened their arms, yet do they
        imagine mischief against me.

007:016 They return, but not to the most High: they are like a
        deceitful bow: their princes shall fall by the sword for the
        rage of their tongue: this shall be their derision in the land
        of Egypt.

008:001 Set the trumpet to thy mouth. He shall come as an eagle
        against the house of the LORD, because they have transgressed
        my covenant, and trespassed against my law.

008:002 Israel shall cry unto me, My God, we know thee.

008:003 Israel hath cast off the thing that is good: the enemy shall
        pursue him.

008:004 They have set up kings, but not by me: they have made princes,
        and I knew it not: of their silver and their gold have they
        made them idols, that they may be cut off.

008:005 Thy calf, O Samaria, hath cast thee off; mine anger is kindled
        against them: how long will it be ere they attain to
        innocency?

008:006 For from Israel was it also: the workman made it; therefore it
        is not God: but the calf of Samaria shall be broken in pieces.

008:007 For they have sown the wind, and they shall reap the
        whirlwind: it hath no stalk; the bud shall yield no meal: if
        so be it yield, the strangers shall swallow it up.

008:008 Israel is swallowed up: now shall they be among the Gentiles
        as a vessel wherein is no pleasure.

008:009 For they are gone up to Assyria, a wild ass alone by himself:
        Ephraim hath hired lovers.

008:010 Yea, though they have hired among the nations, now will I
        gather them, and they shall sorrow a little for the burden of
        the king of princes.

008:011 Because Ephraim hath made many altars to sin, altars shall be
        unto him to sin.

008:012 I have written to him the great things of my law, but they
        were counted as a strange thing.

008:013 They sacrifice flesh for the sacrifices of mine offerings, and
        eat it; but the LORD accepteth them not; now will he remember
        their iniquity, and visit their sins: they shall return to
        Egypt.

008:014 For Israel hath forgotten his Maker, and buildeth temples; and
        Judah hath multiplied fenced cities: but I will send a fire
        upon his cities, and it shall devour the palaces thereof.

009:001 Rejoice not, O Israel, for joy, as other people: for thou hast
        gone a whoring from thy God, thou hast loved a reward upon
        every cornfloor.

009:002 The floor and the winepress shall not feed them, and the new
        wine shall fail in her.

009:003 They shall not dwell in the LORD's land; but Ephraim shall
        return to Egypt, and they shall eat unclean things in Assyria.

009:004 They shall not offer wine offerings to the LORD, neither shall
        they be pleasing unto him: their sacrifices shall be unto them
        as the bread of mourners; all that eat thereof shall be
        polluted: for their bread for their soul shall not come into
        the house of the LORD.

009:005 What will ye do in the solemn day, and in the day of the feast
        of the LORD?

009:006 For, lo, they are gone because of destruction: Egypt shall
        gather them up, Memphis shall bury them: the pleasant places
        for their silver, nettles shall possess them: thorns shall be
        in their tabernacles.

009:007 The days of visitation are come, the days of recompence are
        come; Israel shall know it: the prophet is a fool, the
        spiritual man is mad, for the multitude of thine iniquity, and
        the great hatred.

009:008 The watchman of Ephraim was with my God: but the prophet is a
        snare of a fowler in all his ways, and hatred in the house of
        his God.

009:009 They have deeply corrupted themselves, as in the days of
        Gibeah: therefore he will remember their iniquity, he will
        visit their sins.

009:010 I found Israel like grapes in the wilderness; I saw your
        fathers as the firstripe in the fig tree at her first time:
        but they went to Baalpeor, and separated themselves unto that
        shame; and their abominations were according as they loved.

009:011 As for Ephraim, their glory shall fly away like a bird, from
        the birth, and from the womb, and from the conception.

009:012 Though they bring up their children, yet will I bereave them,
        that there shall not be a man left: yea, woe also to them when
        I depart from them!

009:013 Ephraim, as I saw Tyrus, is planted in a pleasant place: but
        Ephraim shall bring forth his children to the murderer.

009:014 Give them, O LORD: what wilt thou give? give them a
        miscarrying womb and dry breasts.

009:015 All their wickedness is in Gilgal: for there I hated them: for
        the wickedness of their doings I will drive them out of mine
        house, I will love them no more: all their princes are
        revolters.

009:016 Ephraim is smitten, their root is dried up, they shall bear no
        fruit: yea, though they bring forth, yet will I slay even the
        beloved fruit of their womb.

009:017 My God will cast them away, because they did not hearken unto
        him: and they shall be wanderers among the nations.

010:001 Israel is an empty vine, he bringeth forth fruit unto himself:
        according to the multitude of his fruit he hath increased the
        altars; according to the goodness of his land they have made
        goodly images.

010:002 Their heart is divided; now shall they be found faulty: he
        shall break down their altars, he shall spoil their images.

010:003 For now they shall say, We have no king, because we feared not
        the LORD; what then should a king do to us?

010:004 They have spoken words, swearing falsely in making a covenant:
        thus judgment springeth up as hemlock in the furrows of the
        field.

010:005 The inhabitants of Samaria shall fear because of the calves of
        Bethaven: for the people thereof shall mourn over it, and the
        priests thereof that rejoiced on it, for the glory thereof,
        because it is departed from it.

010:006 It shall be also carried unto Assyria for a present to king
        Jareb: Ephraim shall receive shame, and Israel shall be
        ashamed of his own counsel.

010:007 As for Samaria, her king is cut off as the foam upon the
        water.

010:008 The high places also of Aven, the sin of Israel, shall be
        destroyed: the thorn and the thistle shall come up on their
        altars; and they shall say to the mountains, Cover us; and to
        the hills, Fall on us.

010:009 O Israel, thou hast sinned from the days of Gibeah: there they
        stood: the battle in Gibeah against the children of iniquity
        did not overtake them.

010:010 It is in my desire that I should chastise them; and the people
        shall be gathered against them, when they shall bind
        themselves in their two furrows.

010:011 And Ephraim is as an heifer that is taught, and loveth to
        tread out the corn; but I passed over upon her fair neck: I
        will make Ephraim to ride; Judah shall plow, and Jacob shall
        break his clods.

010:012 Sow to yourselves in righteousness, reap in mercy; break up
        your fallow ground: for it is time to seek the LORD, till he
        come and rain righteousness upon you.

010:013 Ye have plowed wickedness, ye have reaped iniquity; ye have
        eaten the fruit of lies: because thou didst trust in thy way,
        in the multitude of thy mighty men.

010:014 Therefore shall a tumult arise among thy people, and all thy
        fortresses shall be spoiled, as Shalman spoiled Betharbel in
        the day of battle: the mother was dashed in pieces upon her
        children.

010:015 So shall Bethel do unto you because of your great wickedness:
        in a morning shall the king of Israel utterly be cut off.

011:001 When Israel was a child, then I loved him, and called my son
        out of Egypt.

011:002 As they called them, so they went from them: they sacrificed
        unto Baalim, and burned incense to graven images.

011:003 I taught Ephraim also to go, taking them by their arms; but
        they knew not that I healed them.

011:004 I drew them with cords of a man, with bands of love: and I was
        to them as they that take off the yoke on their jaws, and I
        laid meat unto them.

011:005 He shall not return into the land of Egypt, and the Assyrian
        shall be his king, because they refused to return.

011:006 And the sword shall abide on his cities, and shall consume his
        branches, and devour them, because of their own counsels.

011:007 And my people are bent to backsliding from me: though they
        called them to the most High, none at all would exalt him.

011:008 How shall I give thee up, Ephraim? how shall I deliver thee,
        Israel? how shall I make thee as Admah? how shall I set thee
        as Zeboim? mine heart is turned within me, my repentings are
        kindled together.

011:009 I will not execute the fierceness of mine anger, I will not
        return to destroy Ephraim: for I am God, and not man; the Holy
        One in the midst of thee: and I will not enter into the city.

011:010 They shall walk after the LORD: he shall roar like a lion:
        when he shall roar, then the children shall tremble from the
        west.

011:011 They shall tremble as a bird out of Egypt, and as a dove out
        of the land of Assyria: and I will place them in their houses,
        saith the LORD.

011:012 Ephraim compasseth me about with lies, and the house of Israel
        with deceit: but Judah yet ruleth with God, and is faithful
        with the saints.

012:001 Ephraim feedeth on wind, and followeth after the east wind: he
        daily increaseth lies and desolation; and they do make a
        covenant with the Assyrians, and oil is carried into Egypt.

012:002 The LORD hath also a controversy with Judah, and will punish
        Jacob according to his ways; according to his doings will he
        recompense him.

012:003 He took his brother by the heel in the womb, and by his
        strength he had power with God:

012:004 Yea, he had power over the angel, and prevailed: he wept, and
        made supplication unto him: he found him in Bethel, and there
        he spake with us;

012:005 Even the LORD God of hosts; the LORD is his memorial.

012:006 Therefore turn thou to thy God: keep mercy and judgment and
        wait on thy God continually.

012:007 He is a merchant, the balances of deceit are in his hand: he
        loveth to oppress.

012:008 And Ephraim said, Yet I am become rich, I have found me out
        substance: in all my labours they shall find none iniquity in
        me that were sin.

012:009 And I that am the LORD thy God from the land of Egypt will yet
        make thee to dwell in tabernacles, as in the days of the
        solemn feast.

012:010 I have also spoken by the prophets, and I have multiplied
        visions, and used similitudes, by the ministry of the
        prophets.

012:011 Is there iniquity in Gilead? surely they are vanity: they
        sacrifice bullocks in Gilgal; yea, their altars are as heaps
        in the furrows of the fields.

012:012 And Jacob fled into the country of Syria, and Israel served
        for a wife, and for a wife he kept sheep.

012:013 And by a prophet the LORD brought Israel out of Egypt, and by
        a prophet was he preserved.

012:014 Ephraim provoked him to anger most bitterly: therefore shall
        he leave his blood upon him, and his reproach shall his LORD
        return unto him.

013:001 When Ephraim spake trembling, he exalted himself in Israel;
        but when he offended in Baal, he died.

013:002 And now they sin more and more, and have made them molten
        images of their silver, and idols according to their own
        understanding, all of it the work of the craftsmen: they say
        of them, Let the men that sacrifice kiss the calves.

013:003 Therefore they shall be as the morning cloud and as the early
        dew that passeth away, as the chaff that is driven with the
        whirlwind out of the floor, and as the smoke out of the
        chimney.

013:004 Yet I am the LORD thy God from the land of Egypt, and thou
        shalt know no god but me: for there is no saviour beside me.

013:005 I did know thee in the wilderness, in the land of great
        drought.

013:006 According to their pasture, so were they filled; they were
        filled, and their heart was exalted; therefore have they
        forgotten me.

013:007 Therefore I will be unto them as a lion: as a leopard by the
        way will I observe them:

013:008 I will meet them as a bear that is bereaved of her whelps, and
        will rend the caul of their heart, and there will I devour
        them like a lion: the wild beast shall tear them.

013:009 O Israel, thou hast destroyed thyself; but in me is thine
        help.

013:010 I will be thy king: where is any other that may save thee in
        all thy cities? and thy judges of whom thou saidst, Give me a
        king and princes?

013:011 I gave thee a king in mine anger, and took him away in my
        wrath.

013:012 The iniquity of Ephraim is bound up; his sin is hid.

013:013 The sorrows of a travailing woman shall come upon him: he is
        an unwise son; for he should not stay long in the place of the
        breaking forth of children.

013:014 I will ransom them from the power of the grave; I will redeem
        them from death: O death, I will be thy plagues; O grave, I
        will be thy destruction: repentance shall be hid from mine
        eyes.

013:015 Though he be fruitful among his brethren, an east wind shall
        come, the wind of the LORD shall come up from the wilderness,
        and his spring shall become dry, and his fountain shall be
        dried up: he shall spoil the treasure of all pleasant vessels.

013:016 Samaria shall become desolate; for she hath rebelled against
        her God: they shall fall by the sword: their infants shall be
        dashed in pieces, and their women with child shall be ripped
        up.

014:001 O israel, return unto the LORD thy God; for thou hast fallen
        by thine iniquity.

014:002 Take with you words, and turn to the LORD: say unto him, Take
        away all iniquity, and receive us graciously: so will we
        render the calves of our lips.

014:003 Asshur shall not save us; we will not ride upon horses:
        neither will we say any more to the work of our hands, Ye are
        our gods: for in thee the fatherless findeth mercy.

014:004 I will heal their backsliding, I will love them freely: for
        mine anger is turned away from him.

014:005 I will be as the dew unto Israel: he shall grow as the lily,
        and cast forth his roots as Lebanon.

014:006 His branches shall spread, and his beauty shall be as the
        olive tree, and his smell as Lebanon.

014:007 They that dwell under his shadow shall return; they shall
        revive as the corn, and grow as the vine: the scent thereof
        shall be as the wine of Lebanon.

014:008 Ephraim shall say, What have I to do any more with idols? I
        have heard him, and observed him: I am like a green fir tree.
        From me is thy fruit found.

014:009 Who is wise, and he shall understand these things? prudent,
        and he shall know them? for the ways of the LORD are right,
        and the just shall walk in them: but the transgressors shall
        fall therein.

Book 29	Joel

001:001 The word of the LORD that came to Joel the son of Pethuel.

001:002 Hear this, ye old men, and give ear, all ye inhabitants of the
        land. Hath this been in your days, or even in the days of your
        fathers?

001:003 Tell ye your children of it, and let your children tell their
        children, and their children another generation.

001:004 That which the palmerworm hath left hath the locust eaten; and
        that which the locust hath left hath the cankerworm eaten; and
        that which the cankerworm hath left hath the caterpiller
        eaten.

001:005 Awake, ye drunkards, and weep; and howl, all ye drinkers of
        wine, because of the new wine; for it is cut off from your
        mouth.

001:006 For a nation is come up upon my land, strong, and without
        number, whose teeth are the teeth of a lion, and he hath the
        cheek teeth of a great lion.

001:007 He hath laid my vine waste, and barked my fig tree: he hath
        made it clean bare, and cast it away; the branches thereof are
        made white.

001:008 Lament like a virgin girded with sackcloth for the husband of
        her youth.

001:009 The meat offering and the drink offering is cut off from the
        house of the LORD; the priests, the LORD's ministers, mourn.

001:010 The field is wasted, the land mourneth; for the corn is
        wasted: the new wine is dried up, the oil languisheth.

001:011 Be ye ashamed, O ye husbandmen; howl, O ye vinedressers, for
        the wheat and for the barley; because the harvest of the field
        is perished.

001:012 The vine is dried up, and the fig tree languisheth; the
        pomegranate tree, the palm tree also, and the apple tree, even
        all the trees of the field, are withered: because joy is
        withered away from the sons of men.

001:013 Gird yourselves, and lament, ye priests: howl, ye ministers of
        the altar: come, lie all night in sackcloth, ye ministers of
        my God: for the meat offering and the drink offering is
        withholden from the house of your God.

001:014 Sanctify ye a fast, call a solemn assembly, gather the elders
        and all the inhabitants of the land into the house of the LORD
        your God, and cry unto the LORD,

001:015 Alas for the day! for the day of the LORD is at hand, and as a
        destruction from the Almighty shall it come.

001:016 Is not the meat cut off before our eyes, yea, joy and gladness
        from the house of our God?

001:017 The seed is rotten under their clods, the garners are laid
        desolate, the barns are broken down; for the corn is withered.

001:018 How do the beasts groan! the herds of cattle are perplexed,
        because they have no pasture; yea, the flocks of sheep are
        made desolate.

001:019 O LORD, to thee will I cry: for the fire hath devoured the
        pastures of the wilderness, and the flame hath burned all the
        trees of the field.

001:020 The beasts of the field cry also unto thee: for the rivers of
        waters are dried up, and the fire hath devoured the pastures
        of the wilderness.

002:001 Blow ye the trumpet in Zion, and sound an alarm in my holy
        mountain: let all the inhabitants of the land tremble: for the
        day of the LORD cometh, for it is nigh at hand;

002:002 A day of darkness and of gloominess, a day of clouds and of
        thick darkness, as the morning spread upon the mountains: a
        great people and a strong; there hath not been ever the like,
        neither shall be any more after it, even to the years of many
        generations.

002:003 A fire devoureth before them; and behind them a flame burneth:
        the land is as the garden of Eden before them, and behind them
        a desolate wilderness; yea, and nothing shall escape them.

002:004 The appearance of them is as the appearance of horses; and as
        horsemen, so shall they run.

002:005 Like the noise of chariots on the tops of mountains shall they
        leap, like the noise of a flame of fire that devoureth the
        stubble, as a strong people set in battle array.

002:006 Before their face the people shall be much pained: all faces
        shall gather blackness.

002:007 They shall run like mighty men; they shall climb the wall like
        men of war; and they shall march every one on his ways, and
        they shall not break their ranks:

002:008 Neither shall one thrust another; they shall walk every one in
        his path: and when they fall upon the sword, they shall not be
        wounded.

002:009 They shall run to and fro in the city; they shall run upon the
        wall, they shall climb up upon the houses; they shall enter in
        at the windows like a thief.

002:010 The earth shall quake before them; the heavens shall tremble:
        the sun and the moon shall be dark, and the stars shall
        withdraw their shining:

002:011 And the LORD shall utter his voice before his army: for his
        camp is very great: for he is strong that executeth his word:
        for the day of the LORD is great and very terrible; and who
        can abide it?

002:012 Therefore also now, saith the LORD, turn ye even to me with
        all your heart, and with fasting, and with weeping, and with
        mourning:

002:013 And rend your heart, and not your garments, and turn unto the
        LORD your God: for he is gracious and merciful, slow to anger,
        and of great kindness, and repenteth him of the evil.

002:014 Who knoweth if he will return and repent, and leave a blessing
        behind him; even a meat offering and a drink offering unto the
        LORD your God?

002:015 Blow the trumpet in Zion, sanctify a fast, call a solemn
        assembly:

002:016 Gather the people, sanctify the congregation, assemble the
        elders, gather the children, and those that suck the breasts:
        let the bridegroom go forth of his chamber, and the bride out
        of her closet.

002:017 Let the priests, the ministers of the LORD, weep between the
        porch and the altar, and let them say, Spare thy people, O
        LORD, and give not thine heritage to reproach, that the
        heathen should rule over them: wherefore should they say among
        the people, Where is their God?

002:018 Then will the LORD be jealous for his land, and pity his
        people.

002:019 Yea, the LORD will answer and say unto his people, Behold, I
        will send you corn, and wine, and oil, and ye shall be
        satisfied therewith: and I will no more make you a reproach
        among the heathen:

002:020 But I will remove far off from you the northern army, and will
        drive him into a land barren and desolate, with his face
        toward the east sea, and his hinder part toward the utmost
        sea, and his stink shall come up, and his ill savour shall
        come up, because he hath done great things.

002:021 Fear not, O land; be glad and rejoice: for the LORD will do
        great things.

002:022 Be not afraid, ye beasts of the field: for the pastures of the
        wilderness do spring, for the tree beareth her fruit, the fig
        tree and the vine do yield their strength.

002:023 Be glad then, ye children of Zion, and rejoice in the LORD
        your God: for he hath given you the former rain moderately,
        and he will cause to come down for you the rain, the former
        rain, and the latter rain in the first month.

002:024 And the floors shall be full of wheat, and the vats shall
        overflow with wine and oil.

002:025 And I will restore to you the years that the locust hath
        eaten, the cankerworm, and the caterpiller, and the
        palmerworm, my great army which I sent among you.

002:026 And ye shall eat in plenty, and be satisfied, and praise the
        name of the LORD your God, that hath dealt wondrously with
        you: and my people shall never be ashamed.

002:027 And ye shall know that I am in the midst of Israel, and that I
        am the LORD your God, and none else: and my people shall never
        be ashamed.

002:028 And it shall come to pass afterward, that I will pour out my
        spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and your daughters shall
        prophesy, your old men shall dream dreams, your young men
        shall see visions:

002:029 And also upon the servants and upon the handmaids in those
        days will I pour out my spirit.

002:030 And I will shew wonders in the heavens and in the earth,
        blood, and fire, and pillars of smoke.

002:031 The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into
        blood, before the great and terrible day of the LORD come.

002:032 And it shall come to pass, that whosoever shall call on the
        name of the LORD shall be delivered: for in mount Zion and in
        Jerusalem shall be deliverance, as the LORD hath said, and in
        the remnant whom the LORD shall call.

003:001 For, behold, in those days, and in that time, when I shall
        bring again the captivity of Judah and Jerusalem,

003:002 I will also gather all nations, and will bring them down into
        the valley of Jehoshaphat, and will plead with them there for
        my people and for my heritage Israel, whom they have scattered
        among the nations, and parted my land.

003:003 And they have cast lots for my people; and have given a boy
        for an harlot, and sold a girl for wine, that they might
        drink.

003:004 Yea, and what have ye to do with me, O Tyre, and Zidon, and
        all the coasts of Palestine? will ye render me a recompence?
        and if ye recompense me, swiftly and speedily will I return
        your recompence upon your own head;

003:005 Because ye have taken my silver and my gold, and have carried
        into your temples my goodly pleasant things:

003:006 The children also of Judah and the children of Jerusalem have
        ye sold unto the Grecians, that ye might remove them far from
        their border.

003:007 Behold, I will raise them out of the place whither ye have
        sold them, and will return your recompence upon your own head:

003:008 And I will sell your sons and your daughters into the hand of
        the children of Judah, and they shall sell them to the
        Sabeans, to a people far off: for the LORD hath spoken it.

003:009 Proclaim ye this among the Gentiles; Prepare war, wake up the
        mighty men, let all the men of war draw near; let them come
        up:

003:010 Beat your plowshares into swords and your pruninghooks into
        spears: let the weak say, I am strong.

003:011 Assemble yourselves, and come, all ye heathen, and gather
        yourselves together round about: thither cause thy mighty ones
        to come down, O LORD.

003:012 Let the heathen be wakened, and come up to the valley of
        Jehoshaphat: for there will I sit to judge all the heathen
        round about.

003:013 Put ye in the sickle, for the harvest is ripe: come, get you
        down; for the press is full, the fats overflow; for their
        wickedness is great.

003:014 Multitudes, multitudes in the valley of decision: for the day
        of the LORD is near in the valley of decision.

003:015 The sun and the moon shall be darkened, and the stars shall
        withdraw their shining.

003:016 The LORD also shall roar out of Zion, and utter his voice from
        Jerusalem; and the heavens and the earth shall shake: but the
        LORD will be the hope of his people, and the strength of the
        children of Israel.

003:017 So shall ye know that I am the LORD your God dwelling in Zion,
        my holy mountain: then shall Jerusalem be holy, and there
        shall no strangers pass through her any more.

003:018 And it shall come to pass in that day, that the mountains
        shall drop down new wine, and the hills shall flow with milk,
        and all the rivers of Judah shall flow with waters, and a
        fountain shall come forth out of the house of the LORD, and
        shall water the valley of Shittim.

003:019 Egypt shall be a desolation, and Edom shall be a desolate
        wilderness, for the violence against the children of Judah,
        because they have shed innocent blood in their land.

003:020 But Judah shall dwell for ever, and Jerusalem from generation
        to generation.

003:021 For I will cleanse their blood that I have not cleansed: for
        the LORD dwelleth in Zion.

Book 30	Amos

001:001 The words of Amos, who was among the herdmen of Tekoa, which
        he saw concerning Israel in the days of Uzziah king of Judah,
        and in the days of Jeroboam the son of Joash king of Israel,
        two years before the earthquake.

001:002 And he said, The LORD will roar from Zion, and utter his voice
        from Jerusalem; and the habitations of the shepherds shall
        mourn, and the top of Carmel shall wither.

001:003 Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Damascus, and
        for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because
        they have threshed Gilead with threshing instruments of iron:

001:004 But I will send a fire into the house of Hazael, which shall
        devour the palaces of Benhadad.

001:005 I will break also the bar of Damascus, and cut off the
        inhabitant from the plain of Aven, and him that holdeth the
        sceptre from the house of Eden: and the people of Syria shall
        go into captivity unto Kir, saith the LORD.

001:006 Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Gaza, and for
        four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because
        they carried away captive the whole captivity, to deliver them
        up to Edom:

001:007 But I will send a fire on the wall of Gaza, which shall devour
        the palaces thereof:

001:008 And I will cut off the inhabitant from Ashdod, and him that
        holdeth the sceptre from Ashkelon, and I will turn mine hand
        against Ekron: and the remnant of the Philistines shall
        perish, saith the Lord GOD.

001:009 Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Tyrus, and
        for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because
        they delivered up the whole captivity to Edom, and remembered
        not the brotherly covenant:

001:010 But I will send a fire on the wall of Tyrus, which shall
        devour the palaces thereof.

001:011 Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Edom, and for
        four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because he
        did pursue his brother with the sword, and did cast off all
        pity, and his anger did tear perpetually, and he kept his
        wrath for ever:

001:012 But I will send a fire upon Teman, which shall devour the
        palaces of Bozrah.

001:013 Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of the children
        of Ammon, and for four, I will not turn away the punishment
        thereof; because they have ripped up the women with child of
        Gilead, that they might enlarge their border:

001:014 But I will kindle a fire in the wall of Rabbah, and it shall
        devour the palaces thereof, with shouting in the day of
        battle, with a tempest in the day of the whirlwind:

001:015 And their king shall go into captivity, he and his princes
        together, saith the LORD.

002:001 Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Moab, and for
        four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because he
        burned the bones of the king of Edom into lime:

002:002 But I will send a fire upon Moab, and it shall devour the
        palaces of Kirioth: and Moab shall die with tumult, with
        shouting, and with the sound of the trumpet:

002:003 And I will cut off the judge from the midst thereof, and will
        slay all the princes thereof with him, saith the LORD.

002:004 Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Judah, and
        for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because
        they have despised the law of the LORD, and have not kept his
        commandments, and their lies caused them to err, after the
        which their fathers have walked:

002:005 But I will send a fire upon Judah, and it shall devour the
        palaces of Jerusalem.

002:006 Thus saith the LORD; For three transgressions of Israel, and
        for four, I will not turn away the punishment thereof; because
        they sold the righteous for silver, and the poor for a pair of
        shoes;

002:007 That pant after the dust of the earth on the head of the poor,
        and turn aside the way of the meek: and a man and his father
        will go in unto the same maid, to profane my holy name:

002:008 And they lay themselves down upon clothes laid to pledge by
        every altar, and they drink the wine of the condemned in the
        house of their god.

002:009 Yet destroyed I the Amorite before them, whose height was like
        the height of the cedars, and he was strong as the oaks; yet I
        destroyed his fruit from above, and his roots from beneath.

002:010 Also I brought you up from the land of Egypt, and led you
        forty years through the wilderness, to possess the land of the
        Amorite.

002:011 And I raised up of your sons for prophets, and of your young
        men for Nazarites. Is it not even thus, O ye children of
        Israel? saith the LORD.

002:012 But ye gave the Nazarites wine to drink; and commanded the
        prophets, saying, Prophesy not.

002:013 Behold, I am pressed under you, as a cart is pressed that is
        full of sheaves.

002:014 Therefore the flight shall perish from the swift, and the
        strong shall not strengthen his force, neither shall the
        mighty deliver himself:

002:015 Neither shall he stand that handleth the bow; and he that is
        swift of foot shall not deliver himself: neither shall he that
        rideth the horse deliver himself.

002:016 And he that is courageous among the mighty shall flee away
        naked in that day, saith the LORD.

003:001 Hear this word that the LORD hath spoken against you, O
        children of Israel, against the whole family which I brought
        up from the land of Egypt, saying,

003:002 You only have I known of all the families of the earth:
        therefore I will punish you for all your iniquities.

003:003 Can two walk together, except they be agreed?

003:004 Will a lion roar in the forest, when he hath no prey? will a
        young lion cry out of his den, if he have taken nothing?

003:005 Can a bird fall in a snare upon the earth, where no gin is for
        him? shall one take up a snare from the earth, and have taken
        nothing at all?

003:006 Shall a trumpet be blown in the city, and the people not be
        afraid? shall there be evil in a city, and the LORD hath not
        done it?

003:007 Surely the Lord GOD will do nothing, but he revealeth his
        secret unto his servants the prophets.

003:008 The lion hath roared, who will not fear? the Lord GOD hath
        spoken, who can but prophesy?

003:009 Publish in the palaces at Ashdod, and in the palaces in the
        land of Egypt, and say, Assemble yourselves upon the mountains
        of Samaria, and behold the great tumults in the midst thereof,
        and the oppressed in the midst thereof.

003:010 For they know not to do right, saith the LORD, who store up
        violence and robbery in their palaces.

003:011 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; An adversary there shall be
        even round about the land; and he shall bring down thy
        strength from thee, and thy palaces shall be spoiled.

003:012 Thus saith the LORD; As the shepherd taketh out of the mouth
        of the lion two legs, or a piece of an ear; so shall the
        children of Israel be taken out that dwell in Samaria in the
        corner of a bed, and in Damascus in a couch.

003:013 Hear ye, and testify in the house of Jacob, saith the Lord
        GOD, the God of hosts,

003:014 That in the day that I shall visit the transgressions of
        Israel upon him I will also visit the altars of Bethel: and
        the horns of the altar shall be cut off, and fall to the
        ground.

003:015 And I will smite the winter house with the summer house; and
        the houses of ivory shall perish, and the great houses shall
        have an end, saith the LORD.

004:001 Hear this word, ye kine of Bashan, that are in the mountain of
        Samaria, which oppress the poor, which crush the needy, which
        say to their masters, Bring, and let us drink.

004:002 The Lord GOD hath sworn by his holiness, that, lo, the days
        shall come upon you, that he will take you away with hooks,
        and your posterity with fishhooks.

004:003 And ye shall go out at the breaches, every cow at that which
        is before her; and ye shall cast them into the palace, saith
        the LORD.

004:004 Come to Bethel, and transgress; at Gilgal multiply
        transgression; and bring your sacrifices every morning, and
        your tithes after three years:

004:005 And offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving with leaven, and
        proclaim and publish the free offerings: for this liketh you,
        O ye children of Israel, saith the Lord GOD.

004:006 And I also have given you cleanness of teeth in all your
        cities, and want of bread in all your places: yet have ye not
        returned unto me, saith the LORD.

004:007 And also I have withholden the rain from you, when there were
        yet three months to the harvest: and I caused it to rain upon
        one city, and caused it not to rain upon another city: one
        piece was rained upon, and the piece whereupon it rained not
        withered.

004:008 So two or three cities wandered unto one city, to drink water;
        but they were not satisfied: yet have ye not returned unto me,
        saith the LORD.

004:009 I have smitten you with blasting and mildew: when your gardens
        and your vineyards and your fig trees and your olive trees
        increased, the palmerworm devoured them: yet have ye not
        returned unto me, saith the LORD.

004:010 I have sent among you the pestilence after the manner of
        Egypt: your young men have I slain with the sword, and have
        taken away your horses; and I have made the stink of your
        camps to come up unto your nostrils: yet have ye not returned
        unto me, saith the LORD.

004:011 I have overthrown some of you, as God overthrew Sodom and
        Gomorrah, and ye were as a firebrand plucked out of the
        burning: yet have ye not returned unto me, saith the LORD.

004:012 Therefore thus will I do unto thee, O Israel: and because I
        will do this unto thee, prepare to meet thy God, O Israel.

004:013 For, lo, he that formeth the mountains, and createth the wind,
        and declareth unto man what is his thought, that maketh the
        morning darkness, and treadeth upon the high places of the
        earth, The LORD, The God of hosts, is his name.

005:001 Hear ye this word which I take up against you, even a
        lamentation, O house of Israel.

005:002 The virgin of Israel is fallen; she shall no more rise: she is
        forsaken upon her land; there is none to raise her up.

005:003 For thus saith the Lord GOD; The city that went out by a
        thousand shall leave an hundred, and that which went forth by
        an hundred shall leave ten, to the house of Israel.

005:004 For thus saith the LORD unto the house of Israel, Seek ye me,
        and ye shall live:

005:005 But seek not Bethel, nor enter into Gilgal, and pass not to
        Beersheba: for Gilgal shall surely go into captivity, and
        Bethel shall come to nought.

005:006 Seek the LORD, and ye shall live; lest he break out like fire
        in the house of Joseph, and devour it, and there be none to
        quench it in Bethel.

005:007 Ye who turn judgment to wormwood, and leave off righteousness
        in the earth,

005:008 Seek him that maketh the seven stars and Orion, and turneth
        the shadow of death into the morning, and maketh the day dark
        with night: that calleth for the waters of the sea, and
        poureth them out upon the face of the earth: The LORD is his
        name:

005:009 That strengtheneth the spoiled against the strong, so that the
        spoiled shall come against the fortress.

005:010 They hate him that rebuketh in the gate, and they abhor him
        that speaketh uprightly.

005:011 Forasmuch therefore as your treading is upon the poor, and ye
        take from him burdens of wheat: ye have built houses of hewn
        stone, but ye shall not dwell in them; ye have planted
        pleasant vineyards, but ye shall not drink wine of them.

005:012 For I know your manifold transgressions and your mighty sins:
        they afflict the just, they take a bribe, and they turn aside
        the poor in the gate from their right.

005:013 Therefore the prudent shall keep silence in that time; for it
        is an evil time.

005:014 Seek good, and not evil, that ye may live: and so the LORD,
        the God of hosts, shall be with you, as ye have spoken.

005:015 Hate the evil, and love the good, and establish judgment in
        the gate: it may be that the LORD God of hosts will be
        gracious unto the remnant of Joseph.

005:016 Therefore the LORD, the God of hosts, the LORD, saith thus;
        Wailing shall be in all streets; and they shall say in all the
        highways, Alas! alas! and they shall call the husbandman to
        mourning, and such as are skilful of lamentation to wailing.

005:017 And in all vineyards shall be wailing: for I will pass through
        thee, saith the LORD.

005:018 Woe unto you that desire the day of the LORD! to what end is
        it for you? the day of the LORD is darkness, and not light.

005:019 As if a man did flee from a lion, and a bear met him; or went
        into the house, and leaned his hand on the wall, and a serpent
        bit him.

005:020 Shall not the day of the LORD be darkness, and not light? even
        very dark, and no brightness in it?

005:021 I hate, I despise your feast days, and I will not smell in
        your solemn assemblies.

005:022 Though ye offer me burnt offerings and your meat offerings, I
        will not accept them: neither will I regard the peace
        offerings of your fat beasts.

005:023 Take thou away from me the noise of thy songs; for I will not
        hear the melody of thy viols.

005:024 But let judgment run down as waters, and righteousness as a
        mighty stream.

005:025 Have ye offered unto me sacrifices and offerings in the
        wilderness forty years, O house of Israel?

005:026 But ye have borne the tabernacle of your Moloch and Chiun your
        images, the star of your god, which ye made to yourselves.

005:027 Therefore will I cause you to go into captivity beyond
        Damascus, saith the LORD, whose name is The God of hosts.

006:001 Woe to them that are at ease in Zion, and trust in the
        mountain of Samaria, which are named chief of the nations, to
        whom the house of Israel came!

006:002 Pass ye unto Calneh, and see; and from thence go ye to Hamath
        the great: then go down to Gath of the Philistines: be they
        better than these kingdoms? or their border greater than your
        border?

006:003 Ye that put far away the evil day, and cause the seat of
        violence to come near;

006:004 That lie upon beds of ivory, and stretch themselves upon their
        couches, and eat the lambs out of the flock, and the calves
        out of the midst of the stall;

006:005 That chant to the sound of the viol, and invent to themselves
        instruments of musick, like David;

006:006 That drink wine in bowls, and anoint themselves with the chief
        ointments: but they are not grieved for the affliction of
        Joseph.

006:007 Therefore now shall they go captive with the first that go
        captive, and the banquet of them that stretched themselves
        shall be removed.

006:008 The Lord GOD hath sworn by himself, saith the LORD the God of
        hosts, I abhor the excellency of Jacob, and hate his palaces:
        therefore will I deliver up the city with all that is therein.

006:009 And it shall come to pass, if there remain ten men in one
        house, that they shall die.

006:010 And a man's uncle shall take him up, and he that burneth him,
        to bring out the bones out of the house, and shall say unto
        him that is by the sides of the house, Is there yet any with
        thee? and he shall say, No. Then shall he say, Hold thy
        tongue: for we may not make mention of the name of the LORD.

006:011 For, behold, the LORD commandeth, and he will smite the great
        house with breaches, and the little house with clefts.

006:012 Shall horses run upon the rock? will one plow there with oxen?
        for ye have turned judgment into gall, and the fruit of
        righteousness into hemlock:

006:013 Ye which rejoice in a thing of nought, which say, Have we not
        taken to us horns by our own strength?

006:014 But, behold, I will raise up against you a nation, O house of
        Israel, saith the LORD the God of hosts; and they shall
        afflict you from the entering in of Hemath unto the river of
        the wilderness.

007:001 Thus hath the Lord GOD shewed unto me; and, behold, he formed
        grasshoppers in the beginning of the shooting up of the latter
        growth; and, lo, it was the latter growth after the king's
        mowings.

007:002 And it came to pass, that when they had made an end of eating
        the grass of the land, then I said, O Lord GOD, forgive, I
        beseech thee: by whom shall Jacob arise? for he is small.

007:003 The LORD repented for this: It shall not be, saith the LORD.

007:004 Thus hath the Lord GOD shewed unto me: and, behold, the Lord
        GOD called to contend by fire, and it devoured the great deep,
        and did eat up a part.

007:005 Then said I, O Lord GOD, cease, I beseech thee: by whom shall
        Jacob arise? for he is small.

007:006 The LORD repented for this: This also shall not be, saith the
        Lord GOD.

007:007 Thus he shewed me: and, behold, the LORD stood upon a wall
        made by a plumbline, with a plumbline in his hand.

007:008 And the LORD said unto me, Amos, what seest thou? And I said,
        A plumbline. Then said the LORD, Behold, I will set a
        plumbline in the midst of my people Israel: I will not again
        pass by them any more:

007:009 And the high places of Isaac shall be desolate, and the
        sanctuaries of Israel shall be laid waste; and I will rise
        against the house of Jeroboam with the sword.

007:010 Then Amaziah the priest of Bethel sent to Jeroboam king of
        Israel, saying, Amos hath conspired against thee in the midst
        of the house of Israel: the land is not able to bear all his
        words.

007:011 For thus Amos saith, Jeroboam shall die by the sword, and
        Israel shall surely be led away captive out of their own land.

007:012 Also Amaziah said unto Amos, O thou seer, go, flee thee away
        into the land of Judah, and there eat bread, and prophesy
        there:

007:013 But prophesy not again any more at Bethel: for it is the
        king's chapel, and it is the king's court.

007:014 Then answered Amos, and said to Amaziah, I was no prophet,
        neither was I a prophet's son; but I was an herdman, and a
        gatherer of sycomore fruit:

007:015 And the LORD took me as I followed the flock, and the LORD
        said unto me, Go, prophesy unto my people Israel.

007:016 Now therefore hear thou the word of the LORD: Thou sayest,
        Prophesy not against Israel, and drop not thy word against the
        house of Isaac.

007:017 Therefore thus saith the LORD; Thy wife shall be an harlot in
        the city, and thy sons and thy daughters shall fall by the
        sword, and thy land shall be divided by line; and thou shalt
        die in a polluted land: and Israel shall surely go into
        captivity forth of his land.

008:001 Thus hath the Lord GOD shewed unto me: and behold a basket of
        summer fruit.

008:002 And he said, Amos, what seest thou? And I said, A basket of
        summer fruit. Then said the LORD unto me, The end is come upon
        my people of Israel; I will not again pass by them any more.

008:003 And the songs of the temple shall be howlings in that day,
        saith the Lord GOD: there shall be many dead bodies in every
        place; they shall cast them forth with silence.

008:004 Hear this, O ye that swallow up the needy, even to make the
        poor of the land to fail,

008:005 Saying, When will the new moon be gone, that we may sell corn?
        and the sabbath, that we may set forth wheat, making the ephah
        small, and the shekel great, and falsifying the balances by
        deceit?

008:006 That we may buy the poor for silver, and the needy for a pair
        of shoes; yea, and sell the refuse of the wheat?

008:007 The LORD hath sworn by the excellency of Jacob, Surely I will
        never forget any of their works.

008:008 Shall not the land tremble for this, and every one mourn that
        dwelleth therein? and it shall rise up wholly as a flood; and
        it shall be cast out and drowned, as by the flood of Egypt.

008:009 And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the Lord GOD,
        that I will cause the sun to go down at noon, and I will
        darken the earth in the clear day:

008:010 And I will turn your feasts into mourning, and all your songs
        into lamentation; and I will bring up sackcloth upon all
        loins, and baldness upon every head; and I will make it as the
        mourning of an only son, and the end thereof as a bitter day.

008:011 Behold, the days come, saith the Lord GOD, that I will send a
        famine in the land, not a famine of bread, nor a thirst for
        water, but of hearing the words of the LORD:

008:012 And they shall wander from sea to sea, and from the north even
        to the east, they shall run to and fro to seek the word of the
        LORD, and shall not find it.

008:013 In that day shall the fair virgins and young men faint for
        thirst.

008:014 They that swear by the sin of Samaria, and say, Thy god, O
        Dan, liveth; and, The manner of Beersheba liveth; even they
        shall fall, and never rise up again.

009:001 I saw the LORD standing upon the altar: and he said, Smite the
        lintel of the door, that the posts may shake: and cut them in
        the head, all of them; and I will slay the last of them with
        the sword: he that fleeth of them shall not flee away, and he
        that escapeth of them shall not be delivered.

009:002 Though they dig into hell, thence shall mine hand take them;
        though they climb up to heaven, thence will I bring them down:

009:003 And though they hide themselves in the top of Carmel, I will
        search and take them out thence; and though they be hid from
        my sight in the bottom of the sea, thence will I command the
        serpent, and he shall bite them:

009:004 And though they go into captivity before their enemies, thence
        will I command the sword, and it shall slay them: and I will
        set mine eyes upon them for evil, and not for good.

009:005 And the Lord GOD of hosts is he that toucheth the land, and it
        shall melt, and all that dwell therein shall mourn: and it
        shall rise up wholly like a flood; and shall be drowned, as by
        the flood of Egypt.

009:006 It is he that buildeth his stories in the heaven, and hath
        founded his troop in the earth; he that calleth for the waters
        of the sea, and poureth them out upon the face of the earth:
        The LORD is his name.

009:007 Are ye not as children of the Ethiopians unto me, O children
        of Israel? saith the LORD. Have not I brought up Israel out of
        the land of Egypt? and the Philistines from Caphtor, and the
        Syrians from Kir?

009:008 Behold, the eyes of the Lord GOD are upon the sinful kingdom,
        and I will destroy it from off the face of the earth; saving
        that I will not utterly destroy the house of Jacob, saith the
        LORD.

009:009 For, lo, I will command, and I will sift the house of Israel
        among all nations, like as corn is sifted in a sieve, yet
        shall not the least grain fall upon the earth.

009:010 All the sinners of my people shall die by the sword, which
        say, The evil shall not overtake nor prevent us.

009:011 In that day will I raise up the tabernacle of David that is
        fallen, and close up the breaches thereof; and I will raise up
        his ruins, and I will build it as in the days of old:

009:012 That they may possess the remnant of Edom, and of all the
        heathen, which are called by my name, saith the LORD that
        doeth this.

009:013 Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that the plowman shall
        overtake the reaper, and the treader of grapes him that soweth
        seed; and the mountains shall drop sweet wine, and all the
        hills shall melt.

009:014 And I will bring again the captivity of my people of Israel,
        and they shall build the waste cities, and inhabit them; and
        they shall plant vineyards, and drink the wine thereof; they
        shall also make gardens, and eat the fruit of them.

009:015 And I will plant them upon their land, and they shall no more
        be pulled up out of their land which I have given them, saith
        the LORD thy God.

Book 31	Obadiah

001:001 The vision of Obadiah. Thus saith the Lord GOD concerning
        Edom; We have heard a rumour from the LORD, and an ambassador
        is sent among the heathen, Arise ye, and let us rise up
        against her in battle.

001:002 Behold, I have made thee small among the heathen: thou art
        greatly despised.

001:003 The pride of thine heart hath deceived thee, thou that
        dwellest in the clefts of the rock, whose habitation is high;
        that saith in his heart, Who shall bring me down to the
        ground?

001:004 Though thou exalt thyself as the eagle, and though thou set
        thy nest among the stars, thence will I bring thee down, saith
        the LORD.

001:005 If thieves came to thee, if robbers by night, (how art thou
        cut off!) would they not have stolen till they had enough? if
        the grapegatherers came to thee, would they not leave some
        grapes?

001:006 How are the things of Esau searched out! how are his hidden
        things sought up!

001:007 All the men of thy confederacy have brought thee even to the
        border: the men that were at peace with thee have deceived
        thee, and prevailed against thee; that they eat thy bread have
        laid a wound under thee: there is none understanding in him.

001:008 Shall I not in that day, saith the LORD, even destroy the wise
        men out of Edom, and understanding out of the mount of Esau?

001:009 And thy mighty men, O Teman, shall be dismayed, to the end
        that every one of the mount of Esau may be cut off by
        slaughter.

001:010 For thy violence against thy brother Jacob shame shall cover
        thee, and thou shalt be cut off for ever.

001:011 In the day that thou stoodest on the other side, in the day
        that the strangers carried away captive his forces, and
        foreigners entered into his gates, and cast lots upon
        Jerusalem, even thou wast as one of them.

001:012 But thou shouldest not have looked on the day of thy brother
        in the day that he became a stranger; neither shouldest thou
        have rejoiced over the children of Judah in the day of their
        destruction; neither shouldest thou have spoken proudly in the
        day of distress.

001:013 Thou shouldest not have entered into the gate of my people in
        the day of their calamity; yea, thou shouldest not have looked
        on their affliction in the day of their calamity, nor have
        laid hands on their substance in the day of their calamity;

001:014 Neither shouldest thou have stood in the crossway, to cut off
        those of his that did escape; neither shouldest thou have
        delivered up those of his that did remain in the day of
        distress.

001:015 For the day of the LORD is near upon all the heathen: as thou
        hast done, it shall be done unto thee: thy reward shall return
        upon thine own head.

001:016 For as ye have drunk upon my holy mountain, so shall all the
        heathen drink continually, yea, they shall drink, and they
        shall swallow down, and they shall be as though they had not
        been.

001:017 But upon mount Zion shall be deliverance, and there shall be
        holiness; and the house of Jacob shall possess their
        possessions.

001:018 And the house of Jacob shall be a fire, and the house of
        Joseph a flame, and the house of Esau for stubble, and they
        shall kindle in them, and devour them; and there shall not be
        any remaining of the house of Esau; for the LORD hath spoken
        it.

001:019 And they of the south shall possess the mount of Esau; and
        they of the plain the Philistines: and they shall possess the
        fields of Ephraim, and the fields of Samaria: and Benjamin
        shall possess Gilead.

001:020 And the captivity of this host of the children of Israel shall
        possess that of the Canaanites, even unto Zarephath; and the
        captivity of Jerusalem, which is in Sepharad, shall possess
        the cities of the south.

001:021 And saviours shall come up on mount Zion to judge the mount of
        Esau; and the kingdom shall be the LORD's.

Book 32	Jonah

001:001 Now the word of the LORD came unto Jonah the son of Amittai,
        saying,

001:002 Arise, go to Nineveh, that great city, and cry against it; for
        their wickedness is come up before me.

001:003 But Jonah rose up to flee unto Tarshish from the presence of
        the LORD, and went down to Joppa; and he found a ship going to
        Tarshish: so he paid the fare thereof, and went down into it,
        to go with them unto Tarshish from the presence of the LORD.

001:004 But the LORD sent out a great wind into the sea, and there was
        a mighty tempest in the sea, so that the ship was like to be
        broken.

001:005 Then the mariners were afraid, and cried every man unto his
        god, and cast forth the wares that were in the ship into the
        sea, to lighten it of them. But Jonah was gone down into the
        sides of the ship; and he lay, and was fast asleep.

001:006 So the shipmaster came to him, and said unto him, What meanest
        thou, O sleeper? arise, call upon thy God, if so be that God
        will think upon us, that we perish not.

001:007 And they said every one to his fellow, Come, and let us cast
        lots, that we may know for whose cause this evil is upon us.
        So they cast lots, and the lot fell upon Jonah.

001:008 Then said they unto him, Tell us, we pray thee, for whose
        cause this evil is upon us; What is thine occupation? and
        whence comest thou? what is thy country? and of what people
        art thou?

001:009 And he said unto them, I am an Hebrew; and I fear the LORD,
        the God of heaven, which hath made the sea and the dry land.

001:010 Then were the men exceedingly afraid, and said unto him. Why
        hast thou done this? For the men knew that he fled from the
        presence of the LORD, because he had told them.

001:011 Then said they unto him, What shall we do unto thee, that the
        sea may be calm unto us? for the sea wrought, and was
        tempestuous.

001:012 And he said unto them, Take me up, and cast me forth into the
        sea; so shall the sea be calm unto you: for I know that for my
        sake this great tempest is upon you.

001:013 Nevertheless the men rowed hard to bring it to the land; but
        they could not: for the sea wrought, and was tempestuous
        against them.

001:014 Wherefore they cried unto the LORD, and said, We beseech thee,
        O LORD, we beseech thee, let us not perish for this man's
        life, and lay not upon us innocent blood: for thou, O LORD,
        hast done as it pleased thee.

001:015 So they look up Jonah, and cast him forth into the sea: and
        the sea ceased from her raging.

001:016 Then the men feared the LORD exceedingly, and offered a
        sacrifice unto the LORD, and made vows.

001:017 Now the LORD had prepared a great fish to swallow up Jonah.
        And Jonah was in the belly of the fish three days and three
        nights.

002:001 Then Jonah prayed unto the LORD his God out of the fish's
        belly,

002:002 And said, I cried by reason of mine affliction unto the LORD,
        and he heard me; out of the belly of hell cried I, and thou
        heardest my voice.

002:003 For thou hadst cast me into the deep, in the midst of the
        seas; and the floods compassed me about: all thy billows and
        thy waves passed over me.

002:004 Then I said, I am cast out of thy sight; yet I will look again
        toward thy holy temple.

002:005 The waters compassed me about, even to the soul: the depth
        closed me round about, the weeds were wrapped about my head.

002:006 I went down to the bottoms of the mountains; the earth with
        her bars was about me for ever: yet hast thou brought up my
        life from corruption, O LORD my God.

002:007 When my soul fainted within me I remembered the LORD: and my
        prayer came in unto thee, into thine holy temple.

002:008 They that observe lying vanities forsake their own mercy.

002:009 But I will sacrifice unto thee with the voice of thanksgiving;
        I will pay that that I have vowed. Salvation is of the LORD.

002:010 And the LORD spake unto the fish, and it vomited out Jonah
        upon the dry land.

003:001 And the word of the LORD came unto Jonah the second time,
        saying,

003:002 Arise, go unto Nineveh, that great city, and preach unto it
        the preaching that I bid thee.

003:003 So Jonah arose, and went unto Nineveh, according to the word
        of the LORD. Now Nineveh was an exceeding great city of three
        days' journey.

003:004 And Jonah began to enter into the city a day's journey, and he
        cried, and said, Yet forty days, and Nineveh shall be
        overthrown.

003:005 So the people of Nineveh believed God, and proclaimed a fast,
        and put on sackcloth, from the greatest of them even to the
        least of them.

003:006 For word came unto the king of Nineveh, and he arose from his
        throne, and he laid his robe from him, and covered him with
        sackcloth, and sat in ashes.

003:007 And he caused it to be proclaimed and published through
        Nineveh by the decree of the king and his nobles, saying, Let
        neither man nor beast, herd nor flock, taste any thing: let
        them not feed, nor drink water:

003:008 But let man and beast be covered with sackcloth, and cry
        mightily unto God: yea, let them turn every one from his evil
        way, and from the violence that is in their hands.

003:009 Who can tell if God will turn and repent, and turn away from
        his fierce anger, that we perish not?

003:010 And God saw their works, that they turned from their evil way;
        and God repented of the evil, that he had said that he would
        do unto them; and he did it not.

004:001 But it displeased Jonah exceedingly, and he was very angry.

004:002 And he prayed unto the LORD, and said, I pray thee, O LORD,
        was not this my saying, when I was yet in my country?
        Therefore I fled before unto Tarshish: for I knew that thou
        art a gracious God, and merciful, slow to anger, and of great
        kindness, and repentest thee of the evil.

004:003 Therefore now, O LORD, take, I beseech thee, my life from me;
        for it is better for me to die than to live.

004:004 Then said the LORD, Doest thou well to be angry?

004:005 So Jonah went out of the city, and sat on the east side of the
        city, and there made him a booth, and sat under it in the
        shadow, till he might see what would become of the city.

004:006 And the LORD God prepared a gourd, and made it to come up over
        Jonah, that it might be a shadow over his head, to deliver him
        from his grief. So Jonah was exceeding glad of the gourd.

004:007 But God prepared a worm when the morning rose the next day,
        and it smote the gourd that it withered.

004:008 And it came to pass, when the sun did arise, that God prepared
        a vehement east wind; and the sun beat upon the head of Jonah,
        that he fainted, and wished in himself to die, and said, It is
        better for me to die than to live.

004:009 And God said to Jonah, Doest thou well to be angry for the
        gourd? And he said, I do well to be angry, even unto death.

004:010 Then said the LORD, Thou hast had pity on the gourd, for the
        which thou hast not laboured, neither madest it grow; which
        came up in a night, and perished in a night:

004:011 And should not I spare Nineveh, that great city, wherein are
        more then sixscore thousand persons that cannot discern
        between their right hand and their left hand; and also much
        cattle?

Book 33	Micah

001:001 The word of the LORD that came to Micah the Morasthite in the
        days of Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah, kings of Judah, which he
        saw concerning Samaria and Jerusalem.

001:002 Hear, all ye people; hearken, O earth, and all that therein
        is: and let the Lord GOD be witness against you, the LORD from
        his holy temple.

001:003 For, behold, the LORD cometh forth out of his place, and will
        come down, and tread upon the high places of the earth.

001:004 And the mountains shall be molten under him, and the valleys
        shall be cleft, as wax before the fire, and as the waters that
        are poured down a steep place.

001:005 For the transgression of Jacob is all this, and for the sins
        of the house of Israel. What is the transgression of Jacob? is
        it not Samaria? and what are the high places of Judah? are
        they not Jerusalem?

001:006 Therefore I will make Samaria as an heap of the field, and as
        plantings of a vineyard: and I will pour down the stones
        thereof into the valley, and I will discover the foundations
        thereof.

001:007 And all the graven images thereof shall be beaten to pieces,
        and all the hires thereof shall be burned with the fire, and
        all the idols thereof will I lay desolate: for she gathered it
        of the hire of an harlot, and they shall return to the hire of
        an harlot.

001:008 Therefore I will wail and howl, I will go stripped and naked:
        I will make a wailing like the dragons, and mourning as the
        owls.

001:009 For her wound is incurable; for it is come unto Judah; he is
        come unto the gate of my people, even to Jerusalem.

001:010 Declare ye it not at Gath, weep ye not at all: in the house of
        Aphrah roll thyself in the dust.

001:011 Pass ye away, thou inhabitant of Saphir, having thy shame
        naked: the inhabitant of Zaanan came not forth in the mourning
        of Bethezel; he shall receive of you his standing.

001:012 For the inhabitant of Maroth waited carefully for good: but
        evil came down from the LORD unto the gate of Jerusalem.

001:013 O thou inhabitant of Lachish, bind the chariot to the swift
        beast: she is the beginning of the sin to the daughter of
        Zion: for the transgressions of Israel were found in thee.

001:014 Therefore shalt thou give presents to Moreshethgath: the
        houses of Achzib shall be a lie to the kings of Israel.

001:015 Yet will I bring an heir unto thee, O inhabitant of Mareshah:
        he shall come unto Adullam the glory of Israel.

001:016 Make thee bald, and poll thee for thy delicate children;
        enlarge thy baldness as the eagle; for they are gone into
        captivity from thee.

002:001 Woe to them that devise iniquity, and work evil upon their
        beds! when the morning is light, they practise it, because it
        is in the power of their hand.

002:002 And they covet fields, and take them by violence; and houses,
        and take them away: so they oppress a man and his house, even
        a man and his heritage.

002:003 Therefore thus saith the LORD; Behold, against this family do
        I devise an evil, from which ye shall not remove your necks;
        neither shall ye go haughtily: for this time is evil.

002:004 In that day shall one take up a parable against you, and
        lament with a doleful lamentation, and say, We be utterly
        spoiled: he hath changed the portion of my people: how hath he
        removed it from me! turning away he hath divided our fields.

002:005 Therefore thou shalt have none that shall cast a cord by lot
        in the congregation of the LORD.

002:006 Prophesy ye not, say they to them that prophesy: they shall
        not prophesy to them, that they shall not take shame.

002:007 O thou that art named the house of Jacob, is the spirit of the
        LORD straitened? are these his doings? do not my words do good
        to him that walketh uprightly?

002:008 Even of late my people is risen up as an enemy: ye pull off
        the robe with the garment from them that pass by securely as
        men averse from war.

002:009 The women of my people have ye cast out from their pleasant
        houses; from their children have ye taken away my glory for
        ever.

002:010 Arise ye, and depart; for this is not your rest: because it is
        polluted, it shall destroy you, even with a sore destruction.

002:011 If a man walking in the spirit and falsehood do lie, saying, I
        will prophesy unto thee of wine and of strong drink; he shall
        even be the prophet of this people.

002:012 I will surely assemble, O Jacob, all of thee; I will surely
        gather the remnant of Israel; I will put them together as the
        sheep of Bozrah, as the flock in the midst of their fold: they
        shall make great noise by reason of the multitude of men.

002:013 The breaker is come up before them: they have broken up, and
        have passed through the gate, and are gone out by it: and
        their king shall pass before them, and the LORD on the head of
        them.

003:001 And I said, Hear, I pray you, O heads of Jacob, and ye princes
        of the house of Israel; Is it not for you to know judgment?

003:002 Who hate the good, and love the evil; who pluck off their skin
        from off them, and their flesh from off their bones;

003:003 Who also eat the flesh of my people, and flay their skin from
        off them; and they break their bones, and chop them in pieces,
        as for the pot, and as flesh within the caldron.

003:004 Then shall they cry unto the LORD, but he will not hear them:
        he will even hide his face from them at that time, as they
        have behaved themselves ill in their doings.

003:005 Thus saith the LORD concerning the prophets that make my
        people err, that bite with their teeth, and cry, Peace; and he
        that putteth not into their mouths, they even prepare war
        against him.

003:006 Therefore night shall be unto you, that ye shall not have a
        vision; and it shall be dark unto you, that ye shall not
        divine; and the sun shall go down over the prophets, and the
        day shall be dark over them.

003:007 Then shall the seers be ashamed, and the diviners confounded:
        yea, they shall all cover their lips; for there is no answer
        of God.

003:008 But truly I am full of power by the spirit of the LORD, and of
        judgment, and of might, to declare unto Jacob his
        transgression, and to Israel his sin.

003:009 Hear this, I pray you, ye heads of the house of Jacob, and
        princes of the house of Israel, that abhor judgment, and
        pervert all equity.

003:010 They build up Zion with blood, and Jerusalem with iniquity.

003:011 The heads thereof judge for reward, and the priests thereof
        teach for hire, and the prophets thereof divine for money: yet
        will they lean upon the LORD, and say, Is not the LORD among
        us? none evil can come upon us.

003:012 Therefore shall Zion for your sake be plowed as a field, and
        Jerusalem shall become heaps, and the mountain of the house as
        the high places of the forest.

004:001 But in the last days it shall come to pass, that the mountain
        of the house of the LORD shall be established in the top of
        the mountains, and it shall be exalted above the hills; and
        people shall flow unto it.

004:002 And many nations shall come, and say, Come, and let us go up
        to the mountain of the LORD, and to the house of the God of
        Jacob; and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in
        his paths: for the law shall go forth of Zion, and the word of
        the LORD from Jerusalem.

004:003 And he shall judge among many people, and rebuke strong
        nations afar off; and they shall beat their swords into
        plowshares, and their spears into pruninghooks: nation shall
        not lift up a sword against nation, neither shall they learn
        war any more.

004:004 But they shall sit every man under his vine and under his fig
        tree; and none shall make them afraid: for the mouth of the
        LORD of hosts hath spoken it.

004:005 For all people will walk every one in the name of his god, and
        we will walk in the name of the LORD our God for ever and
        ever.

004:006 In that day, saith the LORD, will I assemble her that halteth,
        and I will gather her that is driven out, and her that I have
        afflicted;

004:007 And I will make her that halted a remnant, and her that was
        cast far off a strong nation: and the LORD shall reign over
        them in mount Zion from henceforth, even for ever.

004:008 And thou, O tower of the flock, the strong hold of the
        daughter of Zion, unto thee shall it come, even the first
        dominion; the kingdom shall come to the daughter of Jerusalem.

004:009 Now why dost thou cry out aloud? is there no king in thee? is
        thy counsellor perished? for pangs have taken thee as a woman
        in travail.

004:010 Be in pain, and labour to bring forth, O daughter of Zion,
        like a woman in travail: for now shalt thou go forth out of
        the city, and thou shalt dwell in the field, and thou shalt go
        even to Babylon; there shalt thou be delivered; there the LORD
        shall redeem thee from the hand of thine enemies.

004:011 Now also many nations are gathered against thee, that say, Let
        her be defiled, and let our eye look upon Zion.

004:012 But they know not the thoughts of the LORD, neither understand
        they his counsel: for he shall gather them as the sheaves into
        the floor.

004:013 Arise and thresh, O daughter of Zion: for I will make thine
        horn iron, and I will make thy hoofs brass: and thou shalt
        beat in pieces many people: and I will consecrate their gain
        unto the LORD, and their substance unto the Lord of the whole
        earth.

005:001 Now gather thyself in troops, O daughter of troops: he hath
        laid siege against us: they shall smite the judge of Israel
        with a rod upon the cheek.

005:002 But thou, Bethlehem Ephratah, though thou be little among the
        thousands of Judah, yet out of thee shall he come forth unto
        me that is to be ruler in Israel; whose goings forth have been
        from of old, from everlasting.

005:003 Therefore will he give them up, until the time that she which
        travaileth hath brought forth: then the remnant of his
        brethren shall return unto the children of Israel.

005:004 And he shall stand and feed in the strength of the LORD, in
        the majesty of the name of the LORD his God; and they shall
        abide: for now shall he be great unto the ends of the earth.

005:005 And this man shall be the peace, when the Assyrian shall come
        into our land: and when he shall tread in our palaces, then
        shall we raise against him seven shepherds, and eight
        principal men.

005:006 And they shall waste the land of Assyria with the sword, and
        the land of Nimrod in the entrances thereof: thus shall he
        deliver us from the Assyrian, when he cometh into our land,
        and when he treadeth within our borders.

005:007 And the remnant of Jacob shall be in the midst of many people
        as a dew from the LORD, as the showers upon the grass, that
        tarrieth not for man, nor waiteth for the sons of men.

005:008 And the remnant of Jacob shall be among the Gentiles in the
        midst of many people as a lion among the beasts of the forest,
        as a young lion among the flocks of sheep: who, if he go
        through, both treadeth down, and teareth in pieces, and none
        can deliver.

005:009 Thine hand shall be lifted up upon thine adversaries, and all
        thine enemies shall be cut off.

005:010 And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the LORD, that I
        will cut off thy horses out of the midst of thee, and I will
        destroy thy chariots:

005:011 And I will cut off the cities of thy land, and throw down all
        thy strong holds:

005:012 And I will cut off witchcrafts out of thine hand; and thou
        shalt have no more soothsayers:

005:013 Thy graven images also will I cut off, and thy standing images
        out of the midst of thee; and thou shalt no more worship the
        work of thine hands.

005:014 And I will pluck up thy groves out of the midst of thee: so
        will I destroy thy cities.

005:015 And I will execute vengeance in anger and fury upon the
        heathen, such as they have not heard.

006:001 Hear ye now what the LORD saith; Arise, contend thou before
        the mountains, and let the hills hear thy voice.

006:002 Hear ye, O mountains, the LORD's controversy, and ye strong
        foundations of the earth: for the LORD hath a controversy with
        his people, and he will plead with Israel.

006:003 O my people, what have I done unto thee? and wherein have I
        wearied thee? testify against me.

006:004 For I brought thee up out of the land of Egypt, and redeemed
        thee out of the house of servants; and I sent before thee
        Moses, Aaron, and Miriam.

006:005 O my people, remember now what Balak king of Moab consulted,
        and what Balaam the son of Beor answered him from Shittim unto
        Gilgal; that ye may know the righteousness of the LORD.

006:006 Wherewith shall I come before the LORD, and bow myself before
        the high God? shall I come before him with burnt offerings,
        with calves of a year old?

006:007 Will the LORD be pleased with thousands of rams, or with ten
        thousands of rivers of oil? shall I give my firstborn for my
        transgression, the fruit of my body for the sin of my soul?

006:008 He hath shewed thee, O man, what is good; and what doth the
        LORD require of thee, but to do justly, and to love mercy, and
        to walk humbly with thy God?

006:009 The LORD's voice crieth unto the city, and the man of wisdom
        shall see thy name: hear ye the rod, and who hath appointed
        it.

006:010 Are there yet the treasures of wickedness in the house of the
        wicked, and the scant measure that is abominable?

006:011 Shall I count them pure with the wicked balances, and with the
        bag of deceitful weights?

006:012 For the rich men thereof are full of violence, and the
        inhabitants thereof have spoken lies, and their tongue is
        deceitful in their mouth.

006:013 Therefore also will I make thee sick in smiting thee, in
        making thee desolate because of thy sins.

006:014 Thou shalt eat, but not be satisfied; and thy casting down
        shall be in the midst of thee; and thou shalt take hold, but
        shalt not deliver; and that which thou deliverest will I give
        up to the sword.

006:015 Thou shalt sow, but thou shalt not reap; thou shalt tread the
        olives, but thou shalt not anoint thee with oil; and sweet
        wine, but shalt not drink wine.

006:016 For the statutes of Omri are kept, and all the works of the
        house of Ahab, and ye walk in their counsels; that I should
        make thee a desolation, and the inhabitants thereof an
        hissing: therefore ye shall bear the reproach of my people.

007:001 Woe is me! for I am as when they have gathered the summer
        fruits, as the grapegleanings of the vintage: there is no
        cluster to eat: my soul desired the firstripe fruit.

007:002 The good man is perished out of the earth: and there is none
        upright among men: they all lie in wait for blood; they hunt
        every man his brother with a net.

007:003 That they may do evil with both hands earnestly, the prince
        asketh, and the judge asketh for a reward; and the great man,
        he uttereth his mischievous desire: so they wrap it up.

007:004 The best of them is as a brier: the most upright is sharper
        than a thorn hedge: the day of thy watchmen and thy visitation
        cometh; now shall be their perplexity.

007:005 Trust ye not in a friend, put ye not confidence in a guide:
        keep the doors of thy mouth from her that lieth in thy bosom.

007:006 For the son dishonoureth the father, the daughter riseth up
        against her mother, the daughter in law against her mother in
        law; a man's enemies are the men of his own house.

007:007 Therefore I will look unto the LORD; I will wait for the God
        of my salvation: my God will hear me.

007:008 Rejoice not against me, O mine enemy: when I fall, I shall
        arise; when I sit in darkness, the LORD shall be a light unto
        me.

007:009 I will bear the indignation of the LORD, because I have sinned
        against him, until he plead my cause, and execute judgment for
        me: he will bring me forth to the light, and I shall behold
        his righteousness.

007:010 Then she that is mine enemy shall see it, and shame shall
        cover her which said unto me, Where is the LORD thy God? mine
        eyes shall behold her: now shall she be trodden down as the
        mire of the streets.

007:011 In the day that thy walls are to be built, in that day shall
        the decree be far removed.

007:012 In that day also he shall come even to thee from Assyria, and
        from the fortified cities, and from the fortress even to the
        river, and from sea to sea, and from mountain to mountain.

007:013 Notwithstanding the land shall be desolate because of them
        that dwell therein, for the fruit of their doings.

007:014 Feed thy people with thy rod, the flock of thine heritage,
        which dwell solitarily in the wood, in the midst of Carmel:
        let them feed in Bashan and Gilead, as in the days of old.

007:015 According to the days of thy coming out of the land of Egypt
        will I shew unto him marvellous things.

007:016 The nations shall see and be confounded at all their might:
        they shall lay their hand upon their mouth, their ears shall
        be deaf.

007:017 They shall lick the dust like a serpent, they shall move out
        of their holes like worms of the earth: they shall be afraid
        of the LORD our God, and shall fear because of thee.

007:018 Who is a God like unto thee, that pardoneth iniquity, and
        passeth by the transgression of the remnant of his heritage?
        he retaineth not his anger for ever, because he delighteth in
        mercy.

007:019 He will turn again, he will have compassion upon us; he will
        subdue our iniquities; and thou wilt cast all their sins into
        the depths of the sea.

007:020 Thou wilt perform the truth to Jacob, and the mercy to
        Abraham, which thou hast sworn unto our fathers from the days
        of old.

Book 34	Nahum

001:001 The burden of Nineveh. The book of the vision of Nahum the
        Elkoshite.

001:002 God is jealous, and the LORD revengeth; the LORD revengeth,
        and is furious; the LORD will take vengeance on his
        adversaries, and he reserveth wrath for his enemies.

001:003 The LORD is slow to anger, and great in power, and will not at
        all acquit the wicked: the LORD hath his way in the whirlwind
        and in the storm, and the clouds are the dust of his feet.

001:004 He rebuketh the sea, and maketh it dry, and drieth up all the
        rivers: Bashan languisheth, and Carmel, and the flower of
        Lebanon languisheth.

001:005 The mountains quake at him, and the hills melt, and the earth
        is burned at his presence, yea, the world, and all that dwell
        therein.

001:006 Who can stand before his indignation? and who can abide in the
        fierceness of his anger? his fury is poured out like fire, and
        the rocks are thrown down by him.

001:007 The LORD is good, a strong hold in the day of trouble; and he
        knoweth them that trust in him.

001:008 But with an overrunning flood he will make an utter end of the
        place thereof, and darkness shall pursue his enemies.

001:009 What do ye imagine against the LORD? he will make an utter
        end: affliction shall not rise up the second time.

001:010 For while they be folden together as thorns, and while they
        are drunken as drunkards, they shall be devoured as stubble
        fully dry.

001:011 There is one come out of thee, that imagineth evil against the
        LORD, a wicked counsellor.

001:012 Thus saith the LORD; Though they be quiet, and likewise many,
        yet thus shall they be cut down, when he shall pass through.
        Though I have afflicted thee, I will afflict thee no more.

001:013 For now will I break his yoke from off thee, and will burst
        thy bonds in sunder.

001:014 And the LORD hath given a commandment concerning thee, that no
        more of thy name be sown: out of the house of thy gods will I
        cut off the graven image and the molten image: I will make thy
        grave; for thou art vile.

001:015 Behold upon the mountains the feet of him that bringeth good
        tidings, that publisheth peace! O Judah, keep thy solemn
        feasts, perform thy vows: for the wicked shall no more pass
        through thee; he is utterly cut off.

002:001 He that dasheth in pieces is come up before thy face: keep the
        munition, watch the way, make thy loins strong, fortify thy
        power mightily.

002:002 For the LORD hath turned away the excellency of Jacob, as the
        excellency of Israel: for the emptiers have emptied them out,
        and marred their vine branches.

002:003 The shield of his mighty men is made red, the valiant men are
        in scarlet: the chariots shall be with flaming torches in the
        day of his preparation, and the fir trees shall be terribly
        shaken.

002:004 The chariots shall rage in the streets, they shall justle one
        against another in the broad ways: they shall seem like
        torches, they shall run like the lightnings.

002:005 He shall recount his worthies: they shall stumble in their
        walk; they shall make haste to the wall thereof, and the
        defence shall be prepared.

002:006 The gates of the rivers shall be opened, and the palace shall
        be dissolved.

002:007 And Huzzab shall be led away captive, she shall be brought up,
        and her maids shall lead her as with the voice of doves,
        tabering upon their breasts.

002:008 But Nineveh is of old like a pool of water: yet they shall
        flee away. Stand, stand, shall they cry; but none shall look
        back.

002:009 Take ye the spoil of silver, take the spoil of gold: for there
        is none end of the store and glory out of all the pleasant
        furniture.

002:010 She is empty, and void, and waste: and the heart melteth, and
        the knees smite together, and much pain is in all loins, and
        the faces of them all gather blackness.

002:011 Where is the dwelling of the lions, and the feedingplace of
        the young lions, where the lion, even the old lion, walked,
        and the lion's whelp, and none made them afraid?

002:012 The lion did tear in pieces enough for his whelps, and
        strangled for his lionesses, and filled his holes with prey,
        and his dens with ravin.

002:013 Behold, I am against thee, saith the LORD of hosts, and I will
        burn her chariots in the smoke, and the sword shall devour thy
        young lions: and I will cut off thy prey from the earth, and
        the voice of thy messengers shall no more be heard.

003:001 Woe to the bloody city! it is all full of lies and robbery;
        the prey departeth not;

003:002 The noise of a whip, and the noise of the rattling of the
        wheels, and of the pransing horses, and of the jumping
        chariots.

003:003 The horseman lifteth up both the bright sword and the
        glittering spear: and there is a multitude of slain, and a
        great number of carcases; and there is none end of their
        corpses; they stumble upon their corpses:

003:004 Because of the multitude of the whoredoms of the wellfavoured
        harlot, the mistress of witchcrafts, that selleth nations
        through her whoredoms, and families through her witchcrafts.

003:005 Behold, I am against thee, saith the LORD of hosts; and I will
        discover thy skirts upon thy face, and I will shew the nations
        thy nakedness, and the kingdoms thy shame.

003:006 And I will cast abominable filth upon thee, and make thee
        vile, and will set thee as a gazingstock.

003:007 And it shall come to pass, that all they that look upon thee
        shall flee from thee, and say, Nineveh is laid waste: who will
        bemoan her? whence shall I seek comforters for thee?

003:008 Art thou better than populous No, that was situate among the
        rivers, that had the waters round about it, whose rampart was
        the sea, and her wall was from the sea?

003:009 Ethiopia and Egypt were her strength, and it was infinite; Put
        and Lubim were thy helpers.

003:010 Yet was she carried away, she went into captivity: her young
        children also were dashed in pieces at the top of all the
        streets: and they cast lots for her honourable men, and all
        her great men were bound in chains.

003:011 Thou also shalt be drunken: thou shalt be hid, thou also shalt
        seek strength because of the enemy.

003:012 All thy strong holds shall be like fig trees with the
        firstripe figs: if they be shaken, they shall even fall into
        the mouth of the eater.

003:013 Behold, thy people in the midst of thee are women: the gates
        of thy land shall be set wide open unto thine enemies: the
        fire shall devour thy bars.

003:014 Draw thee waters for the siege, fortify thy strong holds: go
        into clay, and tread the morter, make strong the brickkiln.

003:015 There shall the fire devour thee; the sword shall cut thee
        off, it shall eat thee up like the cankerworm: make thyself
        many as the cankerworm, make thyself many as the locusts.

003:016 Thou hast multiplied thy merchants above the stars of heaven:
        the cankerworm spoileth, and fleeth away.

003:017 Thy crowned are as the locusts, and thy captains as the great
        grasshoppers, which camp in the hedges in the cold day, but
        when the sun ariseth they flee away, and their place is not
        known where they are.

003:018 Thy shepherds slumber, O king of Assyria: thy nobles shall
        dwell in the dust: thy people is scattered upon the mountains,
        and no man gathereth them.

003:019 There is no healing of thy bruise; thy wound is grievous: all
        that hear the bruit of thee shall clap the hands over thee:
        for upon whom hath not thy wickedness passed continually?

Book 35	Habakkuk

001:001 The burden which Habakkuk the prophet did see.

001:002 O LORD, how long shall I cry, and thou wilt not hear! even cry
        out unto thee of violence, and thou wilt not save!

001:003 Why dost thou shew me iniquity, and cause me to behold
        grievance? for spoiling and violence are before me: and there
        are that raise up strife and contention.

001:004 Therefore the law is slacked, and judgment doth never go
        forth: for the wicked doth compass about the righteous;
        therefore wrong judgment proceedeth.

001:005 Behold ye among the heathen, and regard, and wonder
        marvelously: for I will work a work in your days which ye will
        not believe, though it be told you.

001:006 For, lo, I raise up the Chaldeans, that bitter and hasty
        nation, which shall march through the breadth of the land, to
        possess the dwellingplaces that are not their's.

001:007 They are terrible and dreadful: their judgment and their
        dignity shall proceed of themselves.

001:008 Their horses also are swifter than the leopards, and are more
        fierce than the evening wolves: and their horsemen shall
        spread themselves, and their horsemen shall come from far;
        they shall fly as the eagle that hasteth to eat.

001:009 They shall come all for violence: their faces shall sup up as
        the east wind, and they shall gather the captivity as the
        sand.

001:010 And they shall scoff at the kings, and the princes shall be a
        scorn unto them: they shall deride every strong hold; for they
        shall heap dust, and take it.

001:011 Then shall his mind change, and he shall pass over, and
        offend, imputing this his power unto his god.

001:012 Art thou not from everlasting, O LORD my God, mine Holy One?
        we shall not die. O LORD, thou hast ordained them for
        judgment; and, O mighty God, thou hast established them for
        correction.

001:013 Thou art of purer eyes than to behold evil, and canst not look
        on iniquity: wherefore lookest thou upon them that deal
        treacherously, and holdest thy tongue when the wicked
        devoureth the man that is more righteous than he?

001:014 And makest men as the fishes of the sea, as the creeping
        things, that have no ruler over them?

001:015 They take up all of them with the angle, they catch them in
        their net, and gather them in their drag: therefore they
        rejoice and are glad.

001:016 Therefore they sacrifice unto their net, and burn incense unto
        their drag; because by them their portion is fat, and their
        meat plenteous.

001:017 Shall they therefore empty their net, and not spare
        continually to slay the nations?

002:001 I will stand upon my watch, and set me upon the tower, and
        will watch to see what he will say unto me, and what I shall
        answer when I am reproved.

002:002 And the LORD answered me, and said, Write the vision, and make
        it plain upon tables, that he may run that readeth it.

002:003 For the vision is yet for an appointed time, but at the end it
        shall speak, and not lie: though it tarry, wait for it;
        because it will surely come, it will not tarry.

002:004 Behold, his soul which is lifted up is not upright in him: but
        the just shall live by his faith.

002:005 Yea also, because he transgresseth by wine, he is a proud man,
        neither keepeth at home, who enlargeth his desire as hell, and
        is as death, and cannot be satisfied, but gathereth unto him
        all nations, and heapeth unto him all people:

002:006 Shall not all these take up a parable against him, and a
        taunting proverb against him, and say, Woe to him that
        increaseth that which is not his! how long? and to him that
        ladeth himself with thick clay!

002:007 Shall they not rise up suddenly that shall bite thee, and
        awake that shall vex thee, and thou shalt be for booties unto
        them?

002:008 Because thou hast spoiled many nations, all the remnant of the
        people shall spoil thee; because of men's blood, and for the
        violence of the land, of the city, and of all that dwell
        therein.

002:009 Woe to him that coveteth an evil covetousness to his house,
        that he may set his nest on high, that he may be delivered
        from the power of evil!

002:010 Thou hast consulted shame to thy house by cutting off many
        people, and hast sinned against thy soul.

002:011 For the stone shall cry out of the wall, and the beam out of
        the timber shall answer it.

002:012 Woe to him that buildeth a town with blood, and stablisheth a
        city by iniquity!

002:013 Behold, is it not of the LORD of hosts that the people shall
        labour in the very fire, and the people shall weary themselves
        for very vanity?

002:014 For the earth shall be filled with the knowledge of the glory
        of the LORD, as the waters cover the sea.

002:015 Woe unto him that giveth his neighbour drink, that puttest thy
        bottle to him, and makest him drunken also, that thou mayest
        look on their nakedness!

002:016 Thou art filled with shame for glory: drink thou also, and let
        thy foreskin be uncovered: the cup of the LORD's right hand
        shall be turned unto thee, and shameful spewing shall be on
        thy glory.

002:017 For the violence of Lebanon shall cover thee, and the spoil of
        beasts, which made them afraid, because of men's blood, and
        for the violence of the land, of the city, and of all that
        dwell therein.

002:018 What profiteth the graven image that the maker thereof hath
        graven it; the molten image, and a teacher of lies, that the
        maker of his work trusteth therein, to make dumb idols?

002:019 Woe unto him that saith to the wood, Awake; to the dumb stone,
        Arise, it shall teach! Behold, it is laid over with gold and
        silver, and there is no breath at all in the midst of it.

002:020 But the LORD is in his holy temple: let all the earth keep
        silence before him.

003:001 A prayer of Habakkuk the prophet upon Shigionoth.

003:002 O LORD, I have heard thy speech, and was afraid: O LORD,
        revive thy work in the midst of the years, in the midst of the
        years make known; in wrath remember mercy.

003:003 God came from Teman, and the Holy One from mount Paran. Selah.
        His glory covered the heavens, and the earth was full of his
        praise.

003:004 And his brightness was as the light; he had horns coming out
        of his hand: and there was the hiding of his power.

003:005 Before him went the pestilence, and burning coals went forth
        at his feet.

003:006 He stood, and measured the earth: he beheld, and drove asunder
        the nations; and the everlasting mountains were scattered, the
        perpetual hills did bow: his ways are everlasting.

003:007 I saw the tents of Cushan in affliction: and the curtains of
        the land of Midian did tremble.

003:008 Was the LORD displeased against the rivers? was thine anger
        against the rivers? was thy wrath against the sea, that thou
        didst ride upon thine horses and thy chariots of salvation?

003:009 Thy bow was made quite naked, according to the oaths of the
        tribes, even thy word. Selah. Thou didst cleave the earth with
        rivers.

003:010 The mountains saw thee, and they trembled: the overflowing of
        the water passed by: the deep uttered his voice, and lifted up
        his hands on high.

003:011 The sun and moon stood still in their habitation: at the light
        of thine arrows they went, and at the shining of thy
        glittering spear.

003:012 Thou didst march through the land in indignation, thou didst
        thresh the heathen in anger.

003:013 Thou wentest forth for the salvation of thy people, even for
        salvation with thine anointed; thou woundedst the head out of
        the house of the wicked, by discovering the foundation unto
        the neck. Selah.

003:014 Thou didst strike through with his staves the head of his
        villages: they came out as a whirlwind to scatter me: their
        rejoicing was as to devour the poor secretly.

003:015 Thou didst walk through the sea with thine horses, through the
        heap of great waters.

003:016 When I heard, my belly trembled; my lips quivered at the
        voice: rottenness entered into my bones, and I trembled in
        myself, that I might rest in the day of trouble: when he
        cometh up unto the people, he will invade them with his
        troops.

003:017 Although the fig tree shall not blossom, neither shall fruit
        be in the vines; the labour of the olive shall fail, and the
        fields shall yield no meat; the flock shall be cut off from
        the fold, and there shall be no herd in the stalls:

003:018 Yet I will rejoice in the LORD, I will joy in the God of my
        salvation.

003:019 The LORD God is my strength, and he will make my feet like
        hinds' feet, and he will make me to walk upon mine high
        places. To the chief singer on my stringed instruments.

Book 36	Zephaniah

001:001 The word of the LORD which came unto Zephaniah the son of
        Cushi, the son of Gedaliah, the son of Amariah, the son of
        Hizkiah, in the days of Josiah the son of Amon, king of Judah.

001:002 I will utterly consume all things from off the land, saith the
        LORD.

001:003 I will consume man and beast; I will consume the fowls of the
        heaven, and the fishes of the sea, and the stumblingblocks
        with the wicked: and I will cut off man from off the land,
        saith the LORD.

001:004 I will also stretch out mine hand upon Judah, and upon all the
        inhabitants of Jerusalem; and I will cut off the remnant of
        Baal from this place, and the name of the Chemarims with the
        priests;

001:005 And them that worship the host of heaven upon the housetops;
        and them that worship and that swear by the LORD, and that
        swear by Malcham;

001:006 And them that are turned back from the LORD; and those that
        have not sought the LORD, nor enquired for him.

001:007 Hold thy peace at the presence of the Lord GOD: for the day of
        the LORD is at hand: for the LORD hath prepared a sacrifice,
        he hath bid his guests.

001:008 And it shall come to pass in the day of the LORD's sacrifice,
        that I will punish the princes, and the king's children, and
        all such as are clothed with strange apparel.

001:009 In the same day also will I punish all those that leap on the
        threshold, which fill their masters' houses with violence and
        deceit.

001:010 And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the LORD, that
        there shall be the noise of a cry from the fish gate, and an
        howling from the second, and a great crashing from the hills.

001:011 Howl, ye inhabitants of Maktesh, for all the merchant people
        are cut down; all they that bear silver are cut off.

001:012 And it shall come to pass at that time, that I will search
        Jerusalem with candles, and punish the men that are settled on
        their lees: that say in their heart, The LORD will not do
        good, neither will he do evil.

001:013 Therefore their goods shall become a booty, and their houses a
        desolation: they shall also build houses, but not inhabit
        them; and they shall plant vineyards, but not drink the wine
        thereof.

001:014 The great day of the LORD is near, it is near, and hasteth
        greatly, even the voice of the day of the LORD: the mighty man
        shall cry there bitterly.

001:015 That day is a day of wrath, a day of trouble and distress, a
        day of wasteness and desolation, a day of darkness and
        gloominess, a day of clouds and thick darkness,

001:016 A day of the trumpet and alarm against the fenced cities, and
        against the high towers.

001:017 And I will bring distress upon men, that they shall walk like
        blind men, because they have sinned against the LORD: and
        their blood shall be poured out as dust, and their flesh as
        the dung.

001:018 Neither their silver nor their gold shall be able to deliver
        them in the day of the LORD's wrath; but the whole land shall
        be devoured by the fire of his jealousy: for he shall make
        even a speedy riddance of all them that dwell in the land.

002:001 Gather yourselves together, yea, gather together, O nation not
        desired;

002:002 Before the decree bring forth, before the day pass as the
        chaff, before the fierce anger of the LORD come upon you,
        before the day of the LORD's anger come upon you.

002:003 Seek ye the LORD, all ye meek of the earth, which have wrought
        his judgment; seek righteousness, seek meekness: it may be ye
        shall be hid in the day of the LORD's anger.

002:004 For Gaza shall be forsaken, and Ashkelon a desolation: they
        shall drive out Ashdod at the noon day, and Ekron shall be
        rooted up.

002:005 Woe unto the inhabitants of the sea coast, the nation of the
        Cherethites! the word of the LORD is against you; O Canaan,
        the land of the Philistines, I will even destroy thee, that
        there shall be no inhabitant.

002:006 And the sea coast shall be dwellings and cottages for
        shepherds, and folds for flocks.

002:007 And the coast shall be for the remnant of the house of Judah;
        they shall feed thereupon: in the houses of Ashkelon shall
        they lie down in the evening: for the LORD their God shall
        visit them, and turn away their captivity.

002:008 I have heard the reproach of Moab, and the revilings of the
        children of Ammon, whereby they have reproached my people, and
        magnified themselves against their border.

002:009 Therefore as I live, saith the LORD of hosts, the God of
        Israel, Surely Moab shall be as Sodom, and the children of
        Ammon as Gomorrah, even the breeding of nettles, and saltpits,
        and a perpetual desolation: the residue of my people shall
        spoil them, and the remnant of my people shall possess them.

002:010 This shall they have for their pride, because they have
        reproached and magnified themselves against the people of the
        LORD of hosts.

002:011 The LORD will be terrible unto them: for he will famish all
        the gods of the earth; and men shall worship him, every one
        from his place, even all the isles of the heathen.

002:012 Ye Ethiopians also, ye shall be slain by my sword.

002:013 And he will stretch out his hand against the north, and
        destroy Assyria; and will make Nineveh a desolation, and dry
        like a wilderness.

002:014 And flocks shall lie down in the midst of her, all the beasts
        of the nations: both the cormorant and the bittern shall lodge
        in the upper lintels of it; their voice shall sing in the
        windows; desolation shall be in the thresholds; for he shall
        uncover the cedar work.

002:015 This is the rejoicing city that dwelt carelessly, that said in
        her heart, I am, and there is none beside me: how is she
        become a desolation, a place for beasts to lie down in! every
        one that passeth by her shall hiss, and wag his hand.

003:001 Woe to her that is filthy and polluted, to the oppressing
        city!

003:002 She obeyed not the voice; she received not correction; she
        trusted not in the LORD; she drew not near to her God.

003:003 Her princes within her are roaring lions; her judges are
        evening wolves; they gnaw not the bones till the morrow.

003:004 Her prophets are light and treacherous persons: her priests
        have polluted the sanctuary, they have done violence to the
        law.

003:005 The just LORD is in the midst thereof; he will not do
        iniquity: every morning doth he bring his judgment to light,
        he faileth not; but the unjust knoweth no shame.

003:006 I have cut off the nations: their towers are desolate; I made
        their streets waste, that none passeth by: their cities are
        destroyed, so that there is no man, that there is none
        inhabitant.

003:007 I said, Surely thou wilt fear me, thou wilt receive
        instruction; so their dwelling should not be cut off,
        howsoever I punished them: but they rose early, and corrupted
        all their doings.

003:008 Therefore wait ye upon me, saith the LORD, until the day that
        I rise up to the prey: for my determination is to gather the
        nations, that I may assemble the kingdoms, to pour upon them
        mine indignation, even all my fierce anger: for all the earth
        shall be devoured with the fire of my jealousy.

003:009 For then will I turn to the people a pure language, that they
        may all call upon the name of the LORD, to serve him with one
        consent.

003:010 From beyond the rivers of Ethiopia my suppliants, even the
        daughter of my dispersed, shall bring mine offering.

003:011 In that day shalt thou not be ashamed for all thy doings,
        wherein thou hast transgressed against me: for then I will
        take away out of the midst of thee them that rejoice in thy
        pride, and thou shalt no more be haughty because of my holy
        mountain.

003:012 I will also leave in the midst of thee an afflicted and poor
        people, and they shall trust in the name of the LORD.

003:013 The remnant of Israel shall not do iniquity, nor speak lies;
        neither shall a deceitful tongue be found in their mouth: for
        they shall feed and lie down, and none shall make them afraid.

003:014 Sing, O daughter of Zion; shout, O Israel; be glad and rejoice
        with all the heart, O daughter of Jerusalem.

003:015 The LORD hath taken away thy judgments, he hath cast out thine
        enemy: the king of Israel, even the LORD, is in the midst of
        thee: thou shalt not see evil any more.

003:016 In that day it shall be said to Jerusalem, Fear thou not: and
        to Zion, Let not thine hands be slack.

003:017 The LORD thy God in the midst of thee is mighty; he will save,
        he will rejoice over thee with joy; he will rest in his love,
        he will joy over thee with singing.

003:018 I will gather them that are sorrowful for the solemn assembly,
        who are of thee, to whom the reproach of it was a burden.

003:019 Behold, at that time I will undo all that afflict thee: and I
        will save her that halteth, and gather her that was driven
        out; and I will get them praise and fame in every land where
        they have been put to shame.

003:020 At that time will I bring you again, even in the time that I
        gather you: for I will make you a name and a praise among all
        people of the earth, when I turn back your captivity before
        your eyes, saith the LORD.

Book 37	Haggai

001:001 In the second year of Darius the king, in the sixth month, in
        the first day of the month, came the word of the LORD by
        Haggai the prophet unto Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel,
        governor of Judah, and to Joshua the son of Josedech, the high
        priest, saying,

001:002 Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, saying, This people say, The
        time is not come, the time that the LORD's house should be
        built.

001:003 Then came the word of the LORD by Haggai the prophet, saying,

001:004 Is it time for you, O ye, to dwell in your cieled houses, and
        this house lie waste?

001:005 Now therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts; Consider your
        ways.

001:006 Ye have sown much, and bring in little; ye eat, but ye have
        not enough; ye drink, but ye are not filled with drink; ye
        clothe you, but there is none warm; and he that earneth wages
        earneth wages to put it into a bag with holes.

001:007 Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Consider your ways.

001:008 Go up to the mountain, and bring wood, and build the house;
        and I will take pleasure in it, and I will be glorified, saith
        the LORD.

001:009 Ye looked for much, and, lo it came to little; and when ye
        brought it home, I did blow upon it. Why? saith the LORD of
        hosts. Because of mine house that is waste, and ye run every
        man unto his own house.

001:010 Therefore the heaven over you is stayed from dew, and the
        earth is stayed from her fruit.

001:011 And I called for a drought upon the land, and upon the
        mountains, and upon the corn, and upon the new wine, and upon
        the oil, and upon that which the ground bringeth forth, and
        upon men, and upon cattle, and upon all the labour of the
        hands.

001:012 Then Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Joshua the son of
        Josedech, the high priest, with all the remnant of the people,
        obeyed the voice of the LORD their God, and the words of
        Haggai the prophet, as the LORD their God had sent him, and
        the people did fear before the LORD.

001:013 Then spake Haggai the LORD's messenger in the LORD's message
        unto the people, saying, I am with you, saith the LORD.

001:014 And the LORD stirred up the spirit of Zerubbabel the son of
        Shealtiel, governor of Judah, and the spirit of Joshua the son
        of Josedech, the high priest, and the spirit of all the
        remnant of the people; and they came and did work in the house
        of the LORD of hosts, their God,

001:015 In the four and twentieth day of the sixth month, in the
        second year of Darius the king.

002:001 In the seventh month, in the one and twentieth day of the
        month, came the word of the LORD by the prophet Haggai,
        saying,

002:002 Speak now to Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, governor of
        Judah, and to Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest, and
        to the residue of the people, saying,

002:003 Who is left among you that saw this house in her first glory?
        and how do ye see it now? is it not in your eyes in comparison
        of it as nothing?

002:004 Yet now be strong, O Zerubbabel, saith the LORD; and be
        strong, O Joshua, son of Josedech, the high priest; and be
        strong, all ye people of the land, saith the LORD, and work:
        for I am with you, saith the LORD of hosts:

002:005 According to the word that I covenanted with you when ye came
        out of Egypt, so my spirit remaineth among you: fear ye not.

002:006 For thus saith the LORD of hosts; Yet once, it is a little
        while, and I will shake the heavens, and the earth, and the
        sea, and the dry land;

002:007 And I will shake all nations, and the desire of all nations
        shall come: and I will fill this house with glory, saith the
        LORD of hosts.

002:008 The silver is mine, and the gold is mine, saith the LORD of
        hosts.

002:009 The glory of this latter house shall be greater than of the
        former, saith the LORD of hosts: and in this place will I give
        peace, saith the LORD of hosts.

002:010 In the four and twentieth day of the ninth month, in the
        second year of Darius, came the word of the LORD by Haggai the
        prophet, saying,

002:011 Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Ask now the priests concerning
        the law, saying,

002:012 If one bear holy flesh in the skirt of his garment, and with
        his skirt do touch bread, or pottage, or wine, or oil, or any
        meat, shall it be holy? And the priests answered and said, No.

002:013 Then said Haggai, If one that is unclean by a dead body touch
        any of these, shall it be unclean? And the priests answered
        and said, It shall be unclean.

002:014 Then answered Haggai, and said, So is this people, and so is
        this nation before me, saith the LORD; and so is every work of
        their hands; and that which they offer there is unclean.

002:015 And now, I pray you, consider from this day and upward, from
        before a stone was laid upon a stone in the temple of the
        LORD:

002:016 Since those days were, when one came to an heap of twenty
        measures, there were but ten: when one came to the pressfat
        for to draw out fifty vessels out of the press, there were but
        twenty.

002:017 I smote you with blasting and with mildew and with hail in all
        the labours of your hands; yet ye turned not to me, saith the
        LORD.

002:018 Consider now from this day and upward, from the four and
        twentieth day of the ninth month, even from the day that the
        foundation of the LORD's temple was laid, consider it.

002:019 Is the seed yet in the barn? yea, as yet the vine, and the fig
        tree, and the pomegranate, and the olive tree, hath not
        brought forth: from this day will I bless you.

002:020 And again the word of the LORD came unto Haggai in the four
        and twentieth day of the month, saying,

002:021 Speak to Zerubbabel, governor of Judah, saying, I will shake
        the heavens and the earth;

002:022 And I will overthrow the throne of kingdoms, and I will
        destroy the strength of the kingdoms of the heathen; and I
        will overthrow the chariots, and those that ride in them; and
        the horses and their riders shall come down, every one by the
        sword of his brother.

002:023 In that day, saith the LORD of hosts, will I take thee, O
        Zerubbabel, my servant, the son of Shealtiel, saith the LORD,
        and will make thee as a signet: for I have chosen thee, saith
        the LORD of hosts.

Book 38	Zechariah

001:001 In the eighth month, in the second year of Darius, came the
        word of the LORD unto Zechariah, the son of Berechiah, the son
        of Iddo the prophet, saying,

001:002 The LORD hath been sore displeased with your fathers.

001:003 Therefore say thou unto them, Thus saith the LORD of hosts;
        Turn ye unto me, saith the LORD of hosts, and I will turn unto
        you, saith the LORD of hosts.

001:004 Be ye not as your fathers, unto whom the former prophets have
        cried, saying, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Turn ye now from
        your evil ways, and from your evil doings: but they did not
        hear, nor hearken unto me, saith the LORD.

001:005 Your fathers, where are they? and the prophets, do they live
        for ever?

001:006 But my words and my statutes, which I commanded my servants
        the prophets, did they not take hold of your fathers? and they
        returned and said, Like as the LORD of hosts thought to do
        unto us, according to our ways, and according to our doings,
        so hath he dealt with us.

001:007 Upon the four and twentieth day of the eleventh month, which
        is the month Sebat, in the second year of Darius, came the
        word of the LORD unto Zechariah, the son of Berechiah, the son
        of Iddo the prophet, saying,

001:008 I saw by night, and behold a man riding upon a red horse, and
        he stood among the myrtle trees that were in the bottom; and
        behind him were there red horses, speckled, and white.

001:009 Then said I, O my lord, what are these? And the angel that
        talked with me said unto me, I will shew thee what these be.

001:010 And the man that stood among the myrtle trees answered and
        said, These are they whom the LORD hath sent to walk to and
        fro through the earth.

001:011 And they answered the angel of the LORD that stood among the
        myrtle trees, and said, We have walked to and fro through the
        earth, and, behold, all the earth sitteth still, and is at
        rest.

001:012 Then the angel of the LORD answered and said, O LORD of hosts,
        how long wilt thou not have mercy on Jerusalem and on the
        cities of Judah, against which thou hast had indignation these
        threescore and ten years?

001:013 And the LORD answered the angel that talked with me with good
        words and comfortable words.

001:014 So the angel that communed with me said unto me, Cry thou,
        saying, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; I am jealous for
        Jerusalem and for Zion with a great jealousy.

001:015 And I am very sore displeased with the heathen that are at
        ease: for I was but a little displeased, and they helped
        forward the affliction.

001:016 Therefore thus saith the LORD; I am returned to Jerusalem with
        mercies: my house shall be built in it, saith the LORD of
        hosts, and a line shall be stretched forth upon Jerusalem.

001:017 Cry yet, saying, Thus saith the LORD of hosts; My cities
        through prosperity shall yet be spread abroad; and the LORD
        shall yet comfort Zion, and shall yet choose Jerusalem.

001:018 Then lifted I up mine eyes, and saw, and behold four horns.

001:019 And I said unto the angel that talked with me, What be these?
        And he answered me, These are the horns which have scattered
        Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem.

001:020 And the LORD shewed me four carpenters.

001:021 Then said I, What come these to do? And he spake, saying,
        These are the horns which have scattered Judah, so that no man
        did lift up his head: but these are come to fray them, to cast
        out the horns of the Gentiles, which lifted up their horn over
        the land of Judah to scatter it.

002:001 I lifted up mine eyes again, and looked, and behold a man with
        a measuring line in his hand.

002:002 Then said I, Whither goest thou? And he said unto me, To
        measure Jerusalem, to see what is the breadth thereof, and
        what is the length thereof.

002:003 And, behold, the angel that talked with me went forth, and
        another angel went out to meet him,

002:004 And said unto him, Run, speak to this young man, saying,
        Jerusalem shall be inhabited as towns without walls for the
        multitude of men and cattle therein:

002:005 For I, saith the LORD, will be unto her a wall of fire round
        about, and will be the glory in the midst of her.

002:006 Ho, ho, come forth, and flee from the land of the north, saith
        the LORD: for I have spread you abroad as the four winds of
        the heaven, saith the LORD.

002:007 Deliver thyself, O Zion, that dwellest with the daughter of
        Babylon.

002:008 For thus saith the LORD of hosts; After the glory hath he sent
        me unto the nations which spoiled you: for he that toucheth
        you toucheth the apple of his eye.

002:009 For, behold, I will shake mine hand upon them, and they shall
        be a spoil to their servants: and ye shall know that the LORD
        of hosts hath sent me.

002:010 Sing and rejoice, O daughter of Zion: for, lo, I come, and I
        will dwell in the midst of thee, saith the LORD.

002:011 And many nations shall be joined to the LORD in that day, and
        shall be my people: and I will dwell in the midst of thee, and
        thou shalt know that the LORD of hosts hath sent me unto thee.

002:012 And the LORD shall inherit Judah his portion in the holy land,
        and shall choose Jerusalem again.

002:013 Be silent, O all flesh, before the LORD: for he is raised up
        out of his holy habitation.

003:001 And he shewed me Joshua the high priest standing before the
        angel of the LORD, and Satan standing at his right hand to
        resist him.

003:002 And the LORD said unto Satan, The LORD rebuke thee, O Satan;
        even the LORD that hath chosen Jerusalem rebuke thee: is not
        this a brand plucked out of the fire?

003:003 Now Joshua was clothed with filthy garments, and stood before
        the angel.

003:004 And he answered and spake unto those that stood before him,
        saying, Take away the filthy garments from him. And unto him
        he said, Behold, I have caused thine iniquity to pass from
        thee, and I will clothe thee with change of raiment.

003:005 And I said, Let them set a fair mitre upon his head. So they
        set a fair mitre upon his head, and clothed him with garments.
        And the angel of the LORD stood by.

003:006 And the angel of the LORD protested unto Joshua, saying,

003:007 Thus saith the LORD of hosts; If thou wilt walk in my ways,
        and if thou wilt keep my charge, then thou shalt also judge my
        house, and shalt also keep my courts, and I will give thee
        places to walk among these that stand by.

003:008 Hear now, O Joshua the high priest, thou, and thy fellows that
        sit before thee: for they are men wondered at: for, behold, I
        will bring forth my servant the BRANCH.

003:009 For behold the stone that I have laid before Joshua; upon one
        stone shall be seven eyes: behold, I will engrave the graving
        thereof, saith the LORD of hosts, and I will remove the
        iniquity of that land in one day.

003:010 In that day, saith the LORD of hosts, shall ye call every man
        his neighbour under the vine and under the fig tree.

004:001 And the angel that talked with me came again, and waked me, as
        a man that is wakened out of his sleep.

004:002 And said unto me, What seest thou? And I said, I have looked,
        and behold a candlestick all of gold, with a bowl upon the top
        of it, and his seven lamps thereon, and seven pipes to the
        seven lamps, which are upon the top thereof:

004:003 And two olive trees by it, one upon the right side of the
        bowl, and the other upon the left side thereof.

004:004 So I answered and spake to the angel that talked with me,
        saying, What are these, my lord?

004:005 Then the angel that talked with me answered and said unto me,
        Knowest thou not what these be? And I said, No, my lord.

004:006 Then he answered and spake unto me, saying, This is the word
        of the LORD unto Zerubbabel, saying, Not by might, nor by
        power, but by my spirit, saith the LORD of hosts.

004:007 Who art thou, O great mountain? before Zerubbabel thou shalt
        become a plain: and he shall bring forth the headstone thereof
        with shoutings, crying, Grace, grace unto it.

004:008 Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

004:009 The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this
        house; his hands shall also finish it; and thou shalt know
        that the LORD of hosts hath sent me unto you.

004:010 For who hath despised the day of small things? for they shall
        rejoice, and shall see the plummet in the hand of Zerubbabel
        with those seven; they are the eyes of the LORD, which run to
        and fro through the whole earth.

004:011 Then answered I, and said unto him, What are these two olive
        trees upon the right side of the candlestick and upon the left
        side thereof?

004:012 And I answered again, and said unto him, What be these two
        olive branches which through the two golden pipes empty the
        golden oil out of themselves?

004:013 And he answered me and said, Knowest thou not what these be?
        And I said, No, my lord.

004:014 Then said he, These are the two anointed ones, that stand by
        the LORD of the whole earth.

005:001 Then I turned, and lifted up mine eyes, and looked, and behold
        a flying roll.

005:002 And he said unto me, What seest thou? And I answered, I see a
        flying roll; the length thereof is twenty cubits, and the
        breadth thereof ten cubits.

005:003 Then said he unto me, This is the curse that goeth forth over
        the face of the whole earth: for every one that stealeth shall
        be cut off as on this side according to it; and every one that
        sweareth shall be cut off as on that side according to it.

005:004 I will bring it forth, saith the LORD of hosts, and it shall
        enter into the house of the thief, and into the house of him
        that sweareth falsely by my name: and it shall remain in the
        midst of his house, and shall consume it with the timber
        thereof and the stones thereof.

005:005 Then the angel that talked with me went forth, and said unto
        me, Lift up now thine eyes, and see what is this that goeth
        forth.

005:006 And I said, What is it? And he said, This is an ephah that
        goeth forth. He said moreover, This is their resemblance
        through all the earth.

005:007 And, behold, there was lifted up a talent of lead: and this is
        a woman that sitteth in the midst of the ephah.

005:008 And he said, This is wickedness. And he cast it into the midst
        of the ephah; and he cast the weight of lead upon the mouth
        thereof.

005:009 Then lifted I up mine eyes, and looked, and, behold, there
        came out two women, and the wind was in their wings; for they
        had wings like the wings of a stork: and they lifted up the
        ephah between the earth and the heaven.

005:010 Then said I to the angel that talked with me, Whither do these
        bear the ephah?

005:011 And he said unto me, To build it an house in the land of
        Shinar: and it shall be established, and set there upon her
        own base.

006:001 And I turned, and lifted up mine eyes, and looked, and,
        behold, there came four chariots out from between two
        mountains; and the mountains were mountains of brass.

006:002 In the first chariot were red horses; and in the second
        chariot black horses;

006:003 And in the third chariot white horses; and in the fourth
        chariot grisled and bay horses.

006:004 Then I answered and said unto the angel that talked with me,
        What are these, my lord?

006:005 And the angel answered and said unto me, These are the four
        spirits of the heavens, which go forth from standing before
        the LORD of all the earth.

006:006 The black horses which are therein go forth into the north
        country; and the white go forth after them; and the grisled go
        forth toward the south country.

006:007 And the bay went forth, and sought to go that they might walk
        to and fro through the earth: and he said, Get you hence, walk
        to and fro through the earth. So they walked to and fro
        through the earth.

006:008 Then cried he upon me, and spake unto me, saying, Behold,
        these that go toward the north country have quieted my spirit
        in the north country.

006:009 And the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

006:010 Take of them of the captivity, even of Heldai, of Tobijah, and
        of Jedaiah, which are come from Babylon, and come thou the
        same day, and go into the house of Josiah the son of
        Zephaniah;

006:011 Then take silver and gold, and make crowns, and set them upon
        the head of Joshua the son of Josedech, the high priest;

006:012 And speak unto him, saying, Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts,
        saying, Behold the man whose name is The BRANCH; and he shall
        grow up out of his place, and he shall build the temple of the
        LORD:

006:013 Even he shall build the temple of the LORD; and he shall bear
        the glory, and shall sit and rule upon his throne; and he
        shall be a priest upon his throne: and the counsel of peace
        shall be between them both.

006:014 And the crowns shall be to Helem, and to Tobijah, and to
        Jedaiah, and to Hen the son of Zephaniah, for a memorial in
        the temple of the LORD.

006:015 And they that are far off shall come and build in the temple
        of the LORD, and ye shall know that the LORD of hosts hath
        sent me unto you. And this shall come to pass, if ye will
        diligently obey the voice of the LORD your God.

007:001 And it came to pass in the fourth year of king Darius, that
        the word of the LORD came unto Zechariah in the fourth day of
        the ninth month, even in Chisleu;

007:002 When they had sent unto the house of God Sherezer and
        Regemmelech, and their men, to pray before the LORD,

007:003 And to speak unto the priests which were in the house of the
        LORD of hosts, and to the prophets, saying, Should I weep in
        the fifth month, separating myself, as I have done these so
        many years?

007:004 Then came the word of the LORD of hosts unto me, saying,

007:005 Speak unto all the people of the land, and to the priests,
        saying, When ye fasted and mourned in the fifth and seventh
        month, even those seventy years, did ye at all fast unto me,
        even to me?

007:006 And when ye did eat, and when ye did drink, did not ye eat for
        yourselves, and drink for yourselves?

007:007 Should ye not hear the words which the LORD hath cried by the
        former prophets, when Jerusalem was inhabited and in
        prosperity, and the cities thereof round about her, when men
        inhabited the south and the plain?

007:008 And the word of the LORD came unto Zechariah, saying,

007:009 Thus speaketh the LORD of hosts, saying, Execute true
        judgment, and shew mercy and compassions every man to his
        brother:

007:010 And oppress not the widow, nor the fatherless, the stranger,
        nor the poor; and let none of you imagine evil against his
        brother in your heart.

007:011 But they refused to hearken, and pulled away the shoulder, and
        stopped their ears, that they should not hear.

007:012 Yea, they made their hearts as an adamant stone, lest they
        should hear the law, and the words which the LORD of hosts
        hath sent in his spirit by the former prophets: therefore came
        a great wrath from the LORD of hosts.

007:013 Therefore it is come to pass, that as he cried, and they would
        not hear; so they cried, and I would not hear, saith the LORD
        of hosts:

007:014 But I scattered them with a whirlwind among all the nations
        whom they knew not. Thus the land was desolate after them,
        that no man passed through nor returned: for they laid the
        pleasant land desolate.

008:001 Again the word of the LORD of hosts came to me, saying,

008:002 Thus saith the LORD of hosts; I was jealous for Zion with
        great jealousy, and I was jealous for her with great fury.

008:003 Thus saith the LORD; I am returned unto Zion, and will dwell
        in the midst of Jerusalem: and Jerusalem shall be called a
        city of truth; and the mountain of the LORD of hosts the holy
        mountain.

008:004 Thus saith the LORD of hosts; There shall yet old men and old
        women dwell in the streets of Jerusalem, and every man with
        his staff in his hand for very age.

008:005 And the streets of the city shall be full of boys and girls
        playing in the streets thereof.

008:006 Thus saith the LORD of hosts; If it be marvellous in the eyes
        of the remnant of this people in these days, should it also be
        marvellous in mine eyes? saith the LORD of hosts.

008:007 Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Behold, I will save my people
        from the east country, and from the west country;

008:008 And I will bring them, and they shall dwell in the midst of
        Jerusalem: and they shall be my people, and I will be their
        God, in truth and in righteousness.

008:009 Thus saith the LORD of hosts; Let your hands be strong, ye
        that hear in these days these words by the mouth of the
        prophets, which were in the day that the foundation of the
        house of the LORD of hosts was laid, that the temple might be
        built.

008:010 For before these days there was no hire for man, nor any hire
        for beast; neither was there any peace to him that went out or
        came in because of the affliction: for I set all men every one
        against his neighbour.

008:011 But now I will not be unto the residue of this people as in
        the former days, saith the LORD of hosts.

008:012 For the seed shall be prosperous; the vine shall give her
        fruit, and the ground shall give her increase, and the heavens
        shall give their dew; and I will cause the remnant of this
        people to possess all these things.

008:013 And it shall come to pass, that as ye were a curse among the
        heathen, O house of Judah, and house of Israel; so will I save
        you, and ye shall be a blessing: fear not, but let your hands
        be strong.

008:014 For thus saith the LORD of hosts; As I thought to punish you,
        when your fathers provoked me to wrath, saith the LORD of
        hosts, and I repented not:

008:015 So again have I thought in these days to do well unto
        Jerusalem and to the house of Judah: fear ye not.

008:016 These are the things that ye shall do; Speak ye every man the
        truth to his neighbour; execute the judgment of truth and
        peace in your gates:

008:017 And let none of you imagine evil in your hearts against his
        neighbour; and love no false oath: for all these are things
        that I hate, saith the LORD.

008:018 And the word of the LORD of hosts came unto me, saying,

008:019 Thus saith the LORD of hosts; The fast of the fourth month,
        and the fast of the fifth, and the fast of the seventh, and
        the fast of the tenth, shall be to the house of Judah joy and
        gladness, and cheerful feasts; therefore love the truth and
        peace.

008:020 Thus saith the LORD of hosts; It shall yet come to pass, that
        there shall come people, and the inhabitants of many cities:

008:021 And the inhabitants of one city shall go to another, saying,
        Let us go speedily to pray before the LORD, and to seek the
        LORD of hosts: I will go also.

008:022 Yea, many people and strong nations shall come to seek the
        LORD of hosts in Jerusalem, and to pray before the LORD.

008:023 Thus saith the LORD of hosts; In those days it shall come to
        pass, that ten men shall take hold out of all languages of the
        nations, even shall take hold of the skirt of him that is a
        Jew, saying, We will go with you: for we have heard that God
        is with you.

009:001 The burden of the word of the LORD in the land of Hadrach, and
        Damascus shall be the rest thereof: when the eyes of man, as
        of all the tribes of Israel, shall be toward the LORD.

009:002 And Hamath also shall border thereby; Tyrus, and Zidon, though
        it be very wise.

009:003 And Tyrus did build herself a strong hold, and heaped up
        silver as the dust, and fine gold as the mire of the streets.

009:004 Behold, the LORD will cast her out, and he will smite her
        power in the sea; and she shall be devoured with fire.

009:005 Ashkelon shall see it, and fear; Gaza also shall see it, and
        be very sorrowful, and Ekron; for her expectation shall be
        ashamed; and the king shall perish from Gaza, and Ashkelon
        shall not be inhabited.

009:006 And a bastard shall dwell in Ashdod, and I will cut off the
        pride of the Philistines.

009:007 And I will take away his blood out of his mouth, and his
        abominations from between his teeth: but he that remaineth,
        even he, shall be for our God, and he shall be as a governor
        in Judah, and Ekron as a Jebusite.

009:008 And I will encamp about mine house because of the army,
        because of him that passeth by, and because of him that
        returneth: and no oppressor shall pass through them any more:
        for now have I seen with mine eyes.

009:009 Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion; shout, O daughter of
        Jerusalem: behold, thy King cometh unto thee: he is just, and
        having salvation; lowly, and riding upon an ass, and upon a
        colt the foal of an ass.

009:010 And I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim, and the horse
        from Jerusalem, and the battle bow shall be cut off: and he
        shall speak peace unto the heathen: and his dominion shall be
        from sea even to sea, and from the river even to the ends of
        the earth.

009:011 As for thee also, by the blood of thy covenant I have sent
        forth thy prisoners out of the pit wherein is no water.

009:012 Turn you to the strong hold, ye prisoners of hope: even to day
        do I declare that I will render double unto thee;

009:013 When I have bent Judah for me, filled the bow with Ephraim,
        and raised up thy sons, O Zion, against thy sons, O Greece,
        and made thee as the sword of a mighty man.

009:014 And the LORD shall be seen over them, and his arrow shall go
        forth as the lightning: and the LORD God shall blow the
        trumpet, and shall go with whirlwinds of the south.

009:015 The LORD of hosts shall defend them; and they shall devour,
        and subdue with sling stones; and they shall drink, and make a
        noise as through wine; and they shall be filled like bowls,
        and as the corners of the altar.

009:016 And the LORD their God shall save them in that day as the
        flock of his people: for they shall be as the stones of a
        crown, lifted up as an ensign upon his land.

009:017 For how great is his goodness, and how great is his beauty!
        corn shall make the young men cheerful, and new wine the
        maids.

010:001 Ask ye of the LORD rain in the time of the latter rain; so the
        LORD shall make bright clouds, and give them showers of rain,
        to every one grass in the field.

010:002 For the idols have spoken vanity, and the diviners have seen a
        lie, and have told false dreams; they comfort in vain:
        therefore they went their way as a flock, they were troubled,
        because there was no shepherd.

010:003 Mine anger was kindled against the shepherds, and I punished
        the goats: for the LORD of hosts hath visited his flock the
        house of Judah, and hath made them as his goodly horse in the
        battle.

010:004 Out of him came forth the corner, out of him the nail, out of
        him the battle bow, out of him every oppressor together.

010:005 And they shall be as mighty men, which tread down their
        enemies in the mire of the streets in the battle: and they
        shall fight, because the LORD is with them, and the riders on
        horses shall be confounded.

010:006 And I will strengthen the house of Judah, and I will save the
        house of Joseph, and I will bring them again to place them;
        for I have mercy upon them: and they shall be as though I had
        not cast them off: for I am the LORD their God, and will hear
        them.

010:007 And they of Ephraim shall be like a mighty man, and their
        heart shall rejoice as through wine: yea, their children shall
        see it, and be glad; their heart shall rejoice in the LORD.

010:008 I will hiss for them, and gather them; for I have redeemed
        them: and they shall increase as they have increased.

010:009 And I will sow them among the people: and they shall remember
        me in far countries; and they shall live with their children,
        and turn again.

010:010 I will bring them again also out of the land of Egypt, and
        gather them out of Assyria; and I will bring them into the
        land of Gilead and Lebanon; and place shall not be found for
        them.

010:011 And he shall pass through the sea with affliction, and shall
        smite the waves in the sea, and all the deeps of the river
        shall dry up: and the pride of Assyria shall be brought down,
        and the sceptre of Egypt shall depart away.

010:012 And I will strengthen them in the LORD; and they shall walk up
        and down in his name, saith the LORD.

011:001 Open thy doors, O Lebanon, that the fire may devour thy
        cedars.

011:002 Howl, fir tree; for the cedar is fallen; because the mighty
        are spoiled: howl, O ye oaks of Bashan; for the forest of the
        vintage is come down.

011:003 There is a voice of the howling of the shepherds; for their
        glory is spoiled: a voice of the roaring of young lions; for
        the pride of Jordan is spoiled.

011:004 Thus saith the LORD my God; Feed the flock of the slaughter;

011:005 Whose possessors slay them, and hold themselves not guilty:
        and they that sell them say, Blessed be the LORD; for I am
        rich: and their own shepherds pity them not.

011:006 For I will no more pity the inhabitants of the land, saith the
        LORD: but, lo, I will deliver the men every one into his
        neighbour's hand, and into the hand of his king: and they
        shall smite the land, and out of their hand I will not deliver
        them.

011:007 And I will feed the flock of slaughter, even you, O poor of
        the flock. And I took unto me two staves; the one I called
        Beauty, and the other I called Bands; and I fed the flock.

011:008 Three shepherds also I cut off in one month; and my soul
        lothed them, and their soul also abhorred me.

011:009 Then said I, I will not feed you: that that dieth, let it die;
        and that that is to be cut off, let it be cut off; and let the
        rest eat every one the flesh of another.

011:010 And I took my staff, even Beauty, and cut it asunder, that I
        might break my covenant which I had made with all the people.

011:011 And it was broken in that day: and so the poor of the flock
        that waited upon me knew that it was the word of the LORD.

011:012 And I said unto them, If ye think good, give me my price; and
        if not, forbear. So they weighed for my price thirty pieces of
        silver.

011:013 And the LORD said unto me, Cast it unto the potter: a goodly
        price that I was prised at of them. And I took the thirty
        pieces of silver, and cast them to the potter in the house of
        the LORD.

011:014 Then I cut asunder mine other staff, even Bands, that I might
        break the brotherhood between Judah and Israel.

011:015 And the LORD said unto me, Take unto thee yet the instruments
        of a foolish shepherd.

011:016 For, lo, I will raise up a shepherd in the land, which shall
        not visit those that be cut off, neither shall seek the young
        one, nor heal that that is broken, nor feed that that standeth
        still: but he shall eat the flesh of the fat, and tear their
        claws in pieces.

011:017 Woe to the idol shepherd that leaveth the flock! the sword
        shall be upon his arm, and upon his right eye: his arm shall
        be clean dried up, and his right eye shall be utterly
        darkened.

012:001 The burden of the word of the LORD for Israel, saith the LORD,
        which stretcheth forth the heavens, and layeth the foundation
        of the earth, and formeth the spirit of man within him.

012:002 Behold, I will make Jerusalem a cup of trembling unto all the
        people round about, when they shall be in the siege both
        against Judah and against Jerusalem.

012:003 And in that day will I make Jerusalem a burdensome stone for
        all people: all that burden themselves with it shall be cut in
        pieces, though all the people of the earth be gathered
        together against it.

012:004 In that day, saith the LORD, I will smite every horse with
        astonishment, and his rider with madness: and I will open mine
        eyes upon the house of Judah, and will smite every horse of
        the people with blindness.

012:005 And the governors of Judah shall say in their heart, The
        inhabitants of Jerusalem shall be my strength in the LORD of
        hosts their God.

012:006 In that day will I make the governors of Judah like an hearth
        of fire among the wood, and like a torch of fire in a sheaf;
        and they shall devour all the people round about, on the right
        hand and on the left: and Jerusalem shall be inhabited again
        in her own place, even in Jerusalem.

012:007 The LORD also shall save the tents of Judah first, that the
        glory of the house of David and the glory of the inhabitants
        of Jerusalem do not magnify themselves against Judah.

012:008 In that day shall the LORD defend the inhabitants of
        Jerusalem; and he that is feeble among them at that day shall
        be as David; and the house of David shall be as God, as the
        angel of the LORD before them.

012:009 And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will seek to
        destroy all the nations that come against Jerusalem.

012:010 And I will pour upon the house of David, and upon the
        inhabitants of Jerusalem, the spirit of grace and of
        supplications: and they shall look upon me whom they have
        pierced, and they shall mourn for him, as one mourneth for his
        only son, and shall be in bitterness for him, as one that is
        in bitterness for his firstborn.

012:011 In that day shall there be a great mourning in Jerusalem, as
        the mourning of Hadadrimmon in the valley of Megiddon.

012:012 And the land shall mourn, every family apart; the family of
        the house of David apart, and their wives apart; the family of
        the house of Nathan apart, and their wives apart;

012:013 The family of the house of Levi apart, and their wives apart;
        the family of Shimei apart, and their wives apart;

012:014 All the families that remain, every family apart, and their
        wives apart.

013:001 In that day there shall be a fountain opened to the house of
        David and to the inhabitants of Jerusalem for sin and for
        uncleanness.

013:002 And it shall come to pass in that day, saith the LORD of
        hosts, that I will cut off the names of the idols out of the
        land, and they shall no more be remembered: and also I will
        cause the prophets and the unclean spirit to pass out of the
        land.

013:003 And it shall come to pass, that when any shall yet prophesy,
        then his father and his mother that begat him shall say unto
        him, Thou shalt not live; for thou speakest lies in the name
        of the LORD: and his father and his mother that begat him
        shall thrust him through when he prophesieth.

013:004 And it shall come to pass in that day, that the prophets shall
        be ashamed every one of his vision, when he hath prophesied;
        neither shall they wear a rough garment to deceive:

013:005 But he shall say, I am no prophet, I am an husbandman; for man
        taught me to keep cattle from my youth.

013:006 And one shall say unto him, What are these wounds in thine
        hands? Then he shall answer, Those with which I was wounded in
        the house of my friends.

013:007 Awake, O sword, against my shepherd, and against the man that
        is my fellow, saith the LORD of hosts: smite the shepherd, and
        the sheep shall be scattered: and I will turn mine hand upon
        the little ones.

013:008 And it shall come to pass, that in all the land, saith the
        LORD, two parts therein shall be cut off and die; but the
        third shall be left therein.

013:009 And I will bring the third part through the fire, and will
        refine them as silver is refined, and will try them as gold is
        tried: they shall call on my name, and I will hear them: I
        will say, It is my people: and they shall say, The LORD is my
        God.

014:001 Behold, the day of the LORD cometh, and thy spoil shall be
        divided in the midst of thee.

014:002 For I will gather all nations against Jerusalem to battle; and
        the city shall be taken, and the houses rifled, and the women
        ravished; and half of the city shall go forth into captivity,
        and the residue of the people shall not be cut off from the
        city.

014:003 Then shall the LORD go forth, and fight against those nations,
        as when he fought in the day of battle.

014:004 And his feet shall stand in that day upon the mount of Olives,
        which is before Jerusalem on the east, and the mount of Olives
        shall cleave in the midst thereof toward the east and toward
        the west, and there shall be a very great valley; and half of
        the mountain shall remove toward the north, and half of it
        toward the south.

014:005 And ye shall flee to the valley of the mountains; for the
        valley of the mountains shall reach unto Azal: yea, ye shall
        flee, like as ye fled from before the earthquake in the days
        of Uzziah king of Judah: and the LORD my God shall come, and
        all the saints with thee.

014:006 And it shall come to pass in that day, that the light shall
        not be clear, nor dark:

014:007 But it shall be one day which shall be known to the LORD, not
        day, nor night: but it shall come to pass, that at evening
        time it shall be light.

014:008 And it shall be in that day, that living waters shall go out
        from Jerusalem; half of them toward the former sea, and half
        of them toward the hinder sea: in summer and in winter shall
        it be.

014:009 And the LORD shall be king over all the earth: in that day
        shall there be one LORD, and his name one.

014:010 All the land shall be turned as a plain from Geba to Rimmon
        south of Jerusalem: and it shall be lifted up, and inhabited
        in her place, from Benjamin's gate unto the place of the first
        gate, unto the corner gate, and from the tower of Hananeel
        unto the king's winepresses.

014:011 And men shall dwell in it, and there shall be no more utter
        destruction; but Jerusalem shall be safely inhabited.

014:012 And this shall be the plague wherewith the LORD will smite all
        the people that have fought against Jerusalem; Their flesh
        shall consume away while they stand upon their feet, and their
        eyes shall consume away in their holes, and their tongue shall
        consume away in their mouth.

014:013 And it shall come to pass in that day, that a great tumult
        from the LORD shall be among them; and they shall lay hold
        every one on the hand of his neighbour, and his hand shall
        rise up against the hand of his neighbour.

014:014 And Judah also shall fight at Jerusalem; and the wealth of all
        the heathen round about shall be gathered together, gold, and
        silver, and apparel, in great abundance.

014:015 And so shall be the plague of the horse, of the mule, of the
        camel, and of the ass, and of all the beasts that shall be in
        these tents, as this plague.

014:016 And it shall come to pass, that every one that is left of all
        the nations which came against Jerusalem shall even go up from
        year to year to worship the King, the LORD of hosts, and to
        keep the feast of tabernacles.

014:017 And it shall be, that whoso will not come up of all the
        families of the earth unto Jerusalem to worship the King, the
        LORD of hosts, even upon them shall be no rain.

014:018 And if the family of Egypt go not up, and come not, that have
        no rain; there shall be the plague, wherewith the LORD will
        smite the heathen that come not up to keep the feast of
        tabernacles.

014:019 This shall be the punishment of Egypt, and the punishment of
        all nations that come not up to keep the feast of tabernacles.

014:020 In that day shall there be upon the bells of the horses,
        HOLINESS UNTO THE LORD; and the pots in the LORD's house shall
        be like the bowls before the altar.

014:021 Yea, every pot in Jerusalem and in Judah shall be holiness
        unto the LORD of hosts: and all they that sacrifice shall come
        and take of them, and seethe therein: and in that day there
        shall be no more the Canaanite in the house of the LORD of
        hosts.

Book 39	Malachi

001:001 The burden of the word of the LORD to Israel by Malachi.

001:002 I have loved you, saith the LORD. Yet ye say, Wherein hast
        thou loved us? Was not Esau Jacob's brother? saith the LORD:
        yet I loved Jacob,

001:003 And I hated Esau, and laid his mountains and his heritage
        waste for the dragons of the wilderness.

001:004 Whereas Edom saith, We are impoverished, but we will return
        and build the desolate places; thus saith the LORD of hosts,
        They shall build, but I will throw down; and they shall call
        them, The border of wickedness, and, The people against whom
        the LORD hath indignation for ever.

001:005 And your eyes shall see, and ye shall say, The LORD will be
        magnified from the border of Israel.

001:006 A son honoureth his father, and a servant his master: if then
        I be a father, where is mine honour? and if I be a master,
        where is my fear? saith the LORD of hosts unto you, O priests,
        that despise my name. And ye say, Wherein have we despised thy
        name?

001:007 Ye offer polluted bread upon mine altar; and ye say, Wherein
        have we polluted thee? In that ye say, The table of the LORD
        is contemptible.

001:008 And if ye offer the blind for sacrifice, is it not evil? and
        if ye offer the lame and sick, is it not evil? offer it now
        unto thy governor; will he be pleased with thee, or accept thy
        person? saith the LORD of hosts.

001:009 And now, I pray you, beseech God that he will be gracious unto
        us: this hath been by your means: will he regard your persons?
        saith the LORD of hosts.

001:010 Who is there even among you that would shut the doors for
        nought? neither do ye kindle fire on mine altar for nought. I
        have no pleasure in you, saith the LORD of hosts, neither will
        I accept an offering at your hand.

001:011 For from the rising of the sun even unto the going down of the
        same my name shall be great among the Gentiles; and in every
        place incense shall be offered unto my name, and a pure
        offering: for my name shall be great among the heathen, saith
        the LORD of hosts.

001:012 But ye have profaned it, in that ye say, The table of the LORD
        is polluted; and the fruit thereof, even his meat, is
        contemptible.

001:013 Ye said also, Behold, what a weariness is it! and ye have
        snuffed at it, saith the LORD of hosts; and ye brought that
        which was torn, and the lame, and the sick; thus ye brought an
        offering: should I accept this of your hand? saith the LORD.

001:014 But cursed be the deceiver, which hath in his flock a male,
        and voweth, and sacrificeth unto the LORD a corrupt thing: for
        I am a great King, saith the LORD of hosts, and my name is
        dreadful among the heathen.

002:001 And now, O ye priests, this commandment is for you.

002:002 If ye will not hear, and if ye will not lay it to heart, to
        give glory unto my name, saith the LORD of hosts, I will even
        send a curse upon you, and I will curse your blessings: yea, I
        have cursed them already, because ye do not lay it to heart.

002:003 Behold, I will corrupt your seed, and spread dung upon your
        faces, even the dung of your solemn feasts; and one shall take
        you away with it.

002:004 And ye shall know that I have sent this commandment unto you,
        that my covenant might be with Levi, saith the LORD of hosts.

002:005 My covenant was with him of life and peace; and I gave them to
        him for the fear wherewith he feared me, and was afraid before
        my name.

002:006 The law of truth was in his mouth, and iniquity was not found
        in his lips: he walked with me in peace and equity, and did
        turn many away from iniquity.

002:007 For the priest's lips should keep knowledge, and they should
        seek the law at his mouth: for he is the messenger of the LORD
        of hosts.

002:008 But ye are departed out of the way; ye have caused many to
        stumble at the law; ye have corrupted the covenant of Levi,
        saith the LORD of hosts.

002:009 Therefore have I also made you contemptible and base before
        all the people, according as ye have not kept my ways, but
        have been partial in the law.

002:010 Have we not all one father? hath not one God created us? why
        do we deal treacherously every man against his brother, by
        profaning the covenant of our fathers?

002:011 Judah hath dealt treacherously, and an abomination is
        committed in Israel and in Jerusalem; for Judah hath profaned
        the holiness of the LORD which he loved, and hath married the
        daughter of a strange god.

002:012 The LORD will cut off the man that doeth this, the master and
        the scholar, out of the tabernacles of Jacob, and him that
        offereth an offering unto the LORD of hosts.

002:013 And this have ye done again, covering the altar of the LORD
        with tears, with weeping, and with crying out, insomuch that
        he regardeth not the offering any more, or receiveth it with
        good will at your hand.

002:014 Yet ye say, Wherefore? Because the LORD hath been witness
        between thee and the wife of thy youth, against whom thou hast
        dealt treacherously: yet is she thy companion, and the wife of
        thy covenant.

002:015 And did not he make one? Yet had he the residue of the spirit.
        And wherefore one? That he might seek a godly seed. Therefore
        take heed to your spirit, and let none deal treacherously
        against the wife of his youth.

002:016 For the LORD, the God of Israel, saith that he hateth putting
        away: for one covereth violence with his garment, saith the
        LORD of hosts: therefore take heed to your spirit, that ye
        deal not treacherously.

002:017 Ye have wearied the LORD with your words. Yet ye say, Wherein
        have we wearied him? When ye say, Every one that doeth evil is
        good in the sight of the LORD, and he delighteth in them; or,
        Where is the God of judgment?

003:001 Behold, I will send my messenger, and he shall prepare the way
        before me: and the LORD, whom ye seek, shall suddenly come to
        his temple, even the messenger of the covenant, whom ye
        delight in: behold, he shall come, saith the LORD of hosts.

003:002 But who may abide the day of his coming? and who shall stand
        when he appeareth? for he is like a refiner's fire, and like
        fullers' soap:

003:003 And he shall sit as a refiner and purifier of silver: and he
        shall purify the sons of Levi, and purge them as gold and
        silver, that they may offer unto the LORD an offering in
        righteousness.

003:004 Then shall the offering of Judah and Jerusalem be pleasant
        unto the LORD, as in the days of old, and as in former years.

003:005 And I will come near to you to judgment; and I will be a swift
        witness against the sorcerers, and against the adulterers, and
        against false swearers, and against those that oppress the
        hireling in his wages, the widow, and the fatherless, and that
        turn aside the stranger from his right, and fear not me, saith
        the LORD of hosts.

003:006 For I am the LORD, I change not; therefore ye sons of Jacob
        are not consumed.

003:007 Even from the days of your fathers ye are gone away from mine
        ordinances, and have not kept them. Return unto me, and I will
        return unto you, saith the LORD of hosts. But ye said, Wherein
        shall we return?

003:008 Will a man rob God? Yet ye have robbed me. But ye say, Wherein
        have we robbed thee? In tithes and offerings.

003:009 Ye are cursed with a curse: for ye have robbed me, even this
        whole nation.

003:010 Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be
        meat in mine house, and prove me now herewith, saith the LORD
        of hosts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and
        pour you out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough
        to receive it.

003:011 And I will rebuke the devourer for your sakes, and he shall
        not destroy the fruits of your ground; neither shall your vine
        cast her fruit before the time in the field, saith the LORD of
        hosts.

003:012 And all nations shall call you blessed: for ye shall be a
        delightsome land, saith the LORD of hosts.

003:013 Your words have been stout against me, saith the LORD. Yet ye
        say, What have we spoken so much against thee?

003:014 Ye have said, It is vain to serve God: and what profit is it
        that we have kept his ordinance, and that we have walked
        mournfully before the LORD of hosts?

003:015 And now we call the proud happy; yea, they that work
        wickedness are set up; yea, they that tempt God are even
        delivered.

003:016 Then they that feared the LORD spake often one to another: and
        the LORD hearkened, and heard it, and a book of remembrance
        was written before him for them that feared the LORD, and that
        thought upon his name.

003:017 And they shall be mine, saith the LORD of hosts, in that day
        when I make up my jewels; and I will spare them, as a man
        spareth his own son that serveth him.

003:018 Then shall ye return, and discern between the righteous and
        the wicked, between him that serveth God and him that serveth
        him not.

004:001 For, behold, the day cometh, that shall burn as an oven; and
        all the proud, yea, and all that do wickedly, shall be
        stubble: and the day that cometh shall burn them up, saith the
        LORD of hosts, that it shall leave them neither root nor
        branch.

004:002 But unto you that fear my name shall the Sun of righteousness
        arise with healing in his wings; and ye shall go forth, and
        grow up as calves of the stall.

004:003 And ye shall tread down the wicked; for they shall be ashes
        under the soles of your feet in the day that I shall do this,
        saith the LORD of hosts.

004:004 Remember ye the law of Moses my servant, which I commanded
        unto him in Horeb for all Israel, with the statutes and
        judgments.

004:005 Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming
        of the great and dreadful day of the LORD:

004:006 And he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children,
        and the heart of the children to their fathers, lest I come
        and smite the earth with a curse.

Book 40	Matthew

001:001 The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David,
        the son of Abraham.

001:002 Abraham begat Isaac; and Isaac begat Jacob; and Jacob begat
        Judas and his brethren;

001:003 And Judas begat Phares and Zara of Thamar; and Phares begat
        Esrom; and Esrom begat Aram;

001:004 And Aram begat Aminadab; and Aminadab begat Naasson; and
        Naasson begat Salmon;

001:005 And Salmon begat Booz of Rachab; and Booz begat Obed of Ruth;
        and Obed begat Jesse;

001:006 And Jesse begat David the king; and David the king begat
        Solomon of her that had been the wife of Urias;

001:007 And Solomon begat Roboam; and Roboam begat Abia; and Abia
        begat Asa;

001:008 And Asa begat Josaphat; and Josaphat begat Joram; and Joram
        begat Ozias;

001:009 And Ozias begat Joatham; and Joatham begat Achaz; and Achaz
        begat Ezekias;

001:010 And Ezekias begat Manasses; and Manasses begat Amon; and Amon
        begat Josias;

001:011 And Josias begat Jechonias and his brethren, about the time
        they were carried away to Babylon:

001:012 And after they were brought to Babylon, Jechonias begat
        Salathiel; and Salathiel begat Zorobabel;

001:013 And Zorobabel begat Abiud; and Abiud begat Eliakim; and
        Eliakim begat Azor;

001:014 And Azor begat Sadoc; and Sadoc begat Achim; and Achim begat
        Eliud;

001:015 And Eliud begat Eleazar; and Eleazar begat Matthan; and
        Matthan begat Jacob;

001:016 And Jacob begat Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom was born
        Jesus, who is called Christ.

001:017 So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen
        generations; and from David until the carrying away into
        Babylon are fourteen generations; and from the carrying away
        into Babylon unto Christ are fourteen generations.

001:018 Now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise: When as his
        mother Mary was espoused to Joseph, before they came together,
        she was found with child of the Holy Ghost.

001:019 Then Joseph her husband, being a just man, and not willing to
        make her a publick example, was minded to put her away
        privily.

001:020 But while he thought on these things, behold, the angel of the
        LORD appeared unto him in a dream, saying, Joseph, thou son of
        David, fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife: for that
        which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost.

001:021 And she shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name
        JESUS: for he shall save his people from their sins.

001:022 Now all this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was
        spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying,

001:023 Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a
        son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which being
        interpreted is, God with us.

001:024 Then Joseph being raised from sleep did as the angel of the
        Lord had bidden him, and took unto him his wife:

001:025 And knew her not till she had brought forth her firstborn son:
        and he called his name JESUS.

002:001 Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judaea in the days of
        Herod the king, behold, there came wise men from the east to
        Jerusalem,

002:002 Saying, Where is he that is born King of the Jews? for we have
        seen his star in the east, and are come to worship him.

002:003 When Herod the king had heard these things, he was troubled,
        and all Jerusalem with him.

002:004 And when he had gathered all the chief priests and scribes of
        the people together, he demanded of them where Christ should
        be born.

002:005 And they said unto him, In Bethlehem of Judaea: for thus it is
        written by the prophet,

002:006 And thou Bethlehem, in the land of Juda, art not the least
        among the princes of Juda: for out of thee shall come a
        Governor, that shall rule my people Israel.

002:007 Then Herod, when he had privily called the wise men, enquired
        of them diligently what time the star appeared.

002:008 And he sent them to Bethlehem, and said, Go and search
        diligently for the young child; and when ye have found him,
        bring me word again, that I may come and worship him also.

002:009 When they had heard the king, they departed; and, lo, the
        star, which they saw in the east, went before them, till it
        came and stood over where the young child was.

002:010 When they saw the star, they rejoiced with exceeding great
        joy.

002:011 And when they were come into the house, they saw the young
        child with Mary his mother, and fell down, and worshipped him:
        and when they had opened their treasures, they presented unto
        him gifts; gold, and frankincense and myrrh.

002:012 And being warned of God in a dream that they should not return
        to Herod, they departed into their own country another way.

002:013 And when they were departed, behold, the angel of the Lord
        appeareth to Joseph in a dream, saying, Arise, and take the
        young child and his mother, and flee into Egypt, and be thou
        there until I bring thee word: for Herod will seek the young
        child to destroy him.

002:014 When he arose, he took the young child and his mother by
        night, and departed into Egypt:

002:015 And was there until the death of Herod: that it might be
        fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet, saying,
        Out of Egypt have I called my son.

002:016 Then Herod, when he saw that he was mocked of the wise men,
        was exceeding wroth, and sent forth, and slew all the children
        that were in Bethlehem, and in all the coasts thereof, from
        two years old and under, according to the time which he had
        diligently enquired of the wise men.

002:017 Then was fulfilled that which was spoken by Jeremy the
        prophet, saying,

002:018 In Rama was there a voice heard, lamentation, and weeping, and
        great mourning, Rachel weeping for her children, and would not
        be comforted, because they are not.

002:019 But when Herod was dead, behold, an angel of the Lord
        appeareth in a dream to Joseph in Egypt,

002:020 Saying, Arise, and take the young child and his mother, and go
        into the land of Israel: for they are dead which sought the
        young child's life.

002:021 And he arose, and took the young child and his mother, and
        came into the land of Israel.

002:022 But when he heard that Archelaus did reign in Judaea in the
        room of his father Herod, he was afraid to go thither:
        notwithstanding, being warned of God in a dream, he turned
        aside into the parts of Galilee:

002:023 And he came and dwelt in a city called Nazareth: that it might
        be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets, He shall be
        called a Nazarene.

003:001 In those days came John the Baptist, preaching in the
        wilderness of Judaea,

003:002 And saying, Repent ye: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.

003:003 For this is he that was spoken of by the prophet Esaias,
        saying, The voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare ye
        the way of the Lord, make his paths straight.

003:004 And the same John had his raiment of camel's hair, and a
        leathern girdle about his loins; and his meat was locusts and
        wild honey.

003:005 Then went out to him Jerusalem, and all Judaea, and all the
        region round about Jordan,

003:006 And were baptized of him in Jordan, confessing their sins.

003:007 But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees come to
        his baptism, he said unto them, O generation of vipers, who
        hath warned you to flee from the wrath to come?

003:008 Bring forth therefore fruits meet for repentance:

003:009 And think not to say within yourselves, We have Abraham to our
        father: for I say unto you, that God is able of these stones
        to raise up children unto Abraham.

003:010 And now also the axe is laid unto the root of the trees:
        therefore every tree which bringeth not forth good fruit is
        hewn down, and cast into the fire.

003:011 I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance: but he that
        cometh after me is mightier than I, whose shoes I am not
        worthy to bear: he shall baptize you with the Holy Ghost, and
        with fire:

003:012 Whose fan is in his hand, and he will throughly purge his
        floor, and gather his wheat into the garner; but he will burn
        up the chaff with unquenchable fire.

003:013 Then cometh Jesus from Galilee to Jordan unto John, to be
        baptized of him.

003:014 But John forbad him, saying, I have need to be baptized of
        thee, and comest thou to me?

003:015 And Jesus answering said unto him, Suffer it to be so now: for
        thus it becometh us to fulfil all righteousness. Then he
        suffered him.

003:016 And Jesus, when he was baptized, went up straightway out of
        the water: and, lo, the heavens were opened unto him, and he
        saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove, and lighting
        upon him:

003:017 And lo a voice from heaven, saying, This is my beloved Son, in
        whom I am well pleased.

004:001 Then was Jesus led up of the spirit into the wilderness to be
        tempted of the devil.

004:002 And when he had fasted forty days and forty nights, he was
        afterward an hungred.

004:003 And when the tempter came to him, he said, If thou be the Son
        of God, command that these stones be made bread.

004:004 But he answered and said, It is written, Man shall not live by
        bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the
        mouth of God.

004:005 Then the devil taketh him up into the holy city, and setteth
        him on a pinnacle of the temple,

004:006 And saith unto him, If thou be the Son of God, cast thyself
        down: for it is written, He shall give his angels charge
        concerning thee: and in their hands they shall bear thee up,
        lest at any time thou dash thy foot against a stone.

004:007 Jesus said unto him, It is written again, Thou shalt not tempt
        the Lord thy God.

004:008 Again, the devil taketh him up into an exceeding high
        mountain, and sheweth him all the kingdoms of the world, and
        the glory of them;

004:009 And saith unto him, All these things will I give thee, if thou
        wilt fall down and worship me.

004:010 Then saith Jesus unto him, Get thee hence, Satan: for it is
        written, Thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him only
        shalt thou serve.

004:011 Then the devil leaveth him, and, behold, angels came and
        ministered unto him.

004:012 Now when Jesus had heard that John was cast into prison, he
        departed into Galilee;

004:013 And leaving Nazareth, he came and dwelt in Capernaum, which is
        upon the sea coast, in the borders of Zabulon and Nephthalim:

004:014 That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the
        prophet, saying,

004:015 The land of Zabulon, and the land of Nephthalim, by the way of
        the sea, beyond Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles;

004:016 The people which sat in darkness saw great light; and to them
        which sat in the region and shadow of death light is sprung
        up.

004:017 From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, Repent: for
        the kingdom of heaven is at hand.

004:018 And Jesus, walking by the sea of Galilee, saw two brethren,
        Simon called Peter, and Andrew his brother, casting a net into
        the sea: for they were fishers.

004:019 And he saith unto them, Follow me, and I will make you fishers
        of men.

004:020 And they straightway left their nets, and followed him.

004:021 And going on from thence, he saw other two brethren, James the
        son of Zebedee, and John his brother, in a ship with Zebedee
        their father, mending their nets; and he called them.

004:022 And they immediately left the ship and their father, and
        followed him.

004:023 And Jesus went about all Galilee, teaching in their
        synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and
        healing all manner of sickness and all manner of disease among
        the people.

004:024 And his fame went throughout all Syria: and they brought unto
        him all sick people that were taken with divers diseases and
        torments, and those which were possessed with devils, and
        those which were lunatick, and those that had the palsy; and
        he healed them.

004:025 And there followed him great multitudes of people from
        Galilee, and from Decapolis, and from Jerusalem, and from
        Judaea, and from beyond Jordan.

005:001 And seeing the multitudes, he went up into a mountain: and
        when he was set, his disciples came unto him:

005:002 And he opened his mouth, and taught them, saying,

005:003 Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of
        heaven.

005:004 Blessed are they that mourn: for they shall be comforted.

005:005 Blessed are the meek: for they shall inherit the earth.

005:006 Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after
        righteousness: for they shall be filled.

005:007 Blessed are the merciful: for they shall obtain mercy.

005:008 Blessed are the pure in heart: for they shall see God.

005:009 Blessed are the peacemakers: for they shall be called the
        children of God.

005:010 Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness' sake:
        for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.

005:011 Blessed are ye, when men shall revile you, and persecute you,
        and shall say all manner of evil against you falsely, for my
        sake.

005:012 Rejoice, and be exceeding glad: for great is your reward in
        heaven: for so persecuted they the prophets which were before
        you.

005:013 Ye are the salt of the earth: but if the salt have lost his
        savour, wherewith shall it be salted? it is thenceforth good
        for nothing, but to be cast out, and to be trodden under foot
        of men.

005:014 Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on an hill
        cannot be hid.

005:015 Neither do men light a candle, and put it under a bushel, but
        on a candlestick; and it giveth light unto all that are in the
        house.

005:016 Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your
        good works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.

005:017 Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets:
        I am not come to destroy, but to fulfil.

005:018 For verily I say unto you, Till heaven and earth pass, one jot
        or one tittle shall in no wise pass from the law, till all be
        fulfilled.

005:019 Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least
        commandments, and shall teach men so, he shall be called the
        least in the kingdom of heaven: but whosoever shall do and
        teach them, the same shall be called great in the kingdom of
        heaven.

005:020 For I say unto you, That except your righteousness shall
        exceed the righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees, ye
        shall in no case enter into the kingdom of heaven.

005:021 Ye have heard that it was said of them of old time, Thou shalt
        not kill; and whosoever shall kill shall be in danger of the
        judgment:

005:022 But I say unto you, That whosoever is angry with his brother
        without a cause shall be in danger of the judgment: and
        whosoever shall say to his brother, Raca, shall be in danger
        of the council: but whosoever shall say, Thou fool, shall be
        in danger of hell fire.

005:023 Therefore if thou bring thy gift to the altar, and there
        rememberest that thy brother hath ought against thee;

005:024 Leave there thy gift before the altar, and go thy way; first
        be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy
        gift.

005:025 Agree with thine adversary quickly, whiles thou art in the way
        with him; lest at any time the adversary deliver thee to the
        judge, and the judge deliver thee to the officer, and thou be
        cast into prison.

005:026 Verily I say unto thee, Thou shalt by no means come out
        thence, till thou hast paid the uttermost farthing.

005:027 Ye have heard that it was said by them of old time, Thou shalt
        not commit adultery:

005:028 But I say unto you, That whosoever looketh on a woman to lust
        after her hath committed adultery with her already in his
        heart.

005:029 And if thy right eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it
        from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy
        members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be
        cast into hell.

005:030 And if thy right hand offend thee, cut it off, and cast it
        from thee: for it is profitable for thee that one of thy
        members should perish, and not that thy whole body should be
        cast into hell.

005:031 It hath been said, Whosoever shall put away his wife, let him
        give her a writing of divorcement:

005:032 But I say unto you, That whosoever shall put away his wife,
        saving for the cause of fornication, causeth her to commit
        adultery: and whosoever shall marry her that is divorced
        committeth adultery.

005:033 Again, ye have heard that it hath been said by them of old
        time, Thou shalt not forswear thyself, but shalt perform unto
        the Lord thine oaths:

005:034 But I say unto you, Swear not at all; neither by heaven; for
        it is God's throne:

005:035 Nor by the earth; for it is his footstool: neither by
        Jerusalem; for it is the city of the great King.

005:036 Neither shalt thou swear by thy head, because thou canst not
        make one hair white or black.

005:037 But let your communication be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay: for
        whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil.

005:038 Ye have heard that it hath been said, An eye for an eye, and a
        tooth for a tooth:

005:039 But I say unto you, That ye resist not evil: but whosoever
        shall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other
        also.

005:040 And if any man will sue thee at the law, and take away thy
        coat, let him have thy cloak also.

005:041 And whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile, go with him
        twain.

005:042 Give to him that asketh thee, and from him that would borrow
        of thee turn not thou away.

005:043 Ye have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy
        neighbour, and hate thine enemy.

005:044 But I say unto you, Love your enemies, bless them that curse
        you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which
        despitefully use you, and persecute you;

005:045 That ye may be the children of your Father which is in heaven:
        for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and
        sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust.

005:046 For if ye love them which love you, what reward have ye? do
        not even the publicans the same?

005:047 And if ye salute your brethren only, what do ye more than
        others? do not even the publicans so?

005:048 Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in
        heaven is perfect.

006:001 Take heed that ye do not your alms before men, to be seen of
        them: otherwise ye have no reward of your Father which is in
        heaven.

006:002 Therefore when thou doest thine alms, do not sound a trumpet
        before thee, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the
        streets, that they may have glory of men. Verily I say unto
        you, They have their reward.

006:003 But when thou doest alms, let not thy left hand know what thy
        right hand doeth:

006:004 That thine alms may be in secret: and thy Father which seeth
        in secret himself shall reward thee openly.

006:005 And when thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrites
        are: for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in
        the corners of the streets, that they may be seen of men.
        Verily I say unto you, They have their reward.

006:006 But thou, when thou prayest, enter into thy closet, and when
        thou hast shut thy door, pray to thy Father which is in
        secret; and thy Father which seeth in secret shall reward thee
        openly.

006:007 But when ye pray, use not vain repetitions, as the heathen do:
        for they think that they shall be heard for their much
        speaking.

006:008 Be not ye therefore like unto them: for your Father knoweth
        what things ye have need of, before ye ask him.

006:009 After this manner therefore pray ye: Our Father which art in
        heaven, Hallowed be thy name.

006:010 Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done in earth, as it is in
        heaven.

006:011 Give us this day our daily bread.

006:012 And forgive us our debts, as we forgive our debtors.

006:013 And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil: For
        thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever.
        Amen.

006:014 For if ye forgive men their trespasses, your heavenly Father
        will also forgive you:

006:015 But if ye forgive not men their trespasses, neither will your
        Father forgive your trespasses.

006:016 Moreover when ye fast, be not, as the hypocrites, of a sad
        countenance: for they disfigure their faces, that they may
        appear unto men to fast. Verily I say unto you, They have
        their reward.

006:017 But thou, when thou fastest, anoint thine head, and wash thy
        face;

006:018 That thou appear not unto men to fast, but unto thy Father
        which is in secret: and thy Father, which seeth in secret,
        shall reward thee openly.

006:019 Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and
        rust doth corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal:

006:020 But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither
        moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break
        through nor steal:

006:021 For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.

006:022 The light of the body is the eye: if therefore thine eye be
        single, thy whole body shall be full of light.

006:023 But if thine eye be evil, thy whole body shall be full of
        darkness. If therefore the light that is in thee be darkness,
        how great is that darkness!

006:024 No man can serve two masters: for either he will hate the one,
        and love the other; or else he will hold to the one, and
        despise the other. Ye cannot serve God and mammon.

006:025 Therefore I say unto you, Take no thought for your life, what
        ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body,
        what ye shall put on. Is not the life more than meat, and the
        body than raiment?

006:026 Behold the fowls of the air: for they sow not, neither do they
        reap, nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feedeth
        them. Are ye not much better than they?

006:027 Which of you by taking thought can add one cubit unto his
        stature?

006:028 And why take ye thought for raiment? Consider the lilies of
        the field, how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin:

006:029 And yet I say unto you, That even Solomon in all his glory was
        not arrayed like one of these.

006:030 Wherefore, if God so clothe the grass of the field, which to
        day is, and to morrow is cast into the oven, shall he not much
        more clothe you, O ye of little faith?

006:031 Therefore take no thought, saying, What shall we eat? or, What
        shall we drink? or, Wherewithal shall we be clothed?

006:032 (For after all these things do the Gentiles seek:) for your
        heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things.

006:033 But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness;
        and all these things shall be added unto you.

006:034 Take therefore no thought for the morrow: for the morrow shall
        take thought for the things of itself. Sufficient unto the day
        is the evil thereof.

007:001 Judge not, that ye be not judged.

007:002 For with what judgment ye judge, ye shall be judged: and with
        what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again.

007:003 And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother's eye,
        but considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye?

007:004 Or how wilt thou say to thy brother, Let me pull out the mote
        out of thine eye; and, behold, a beam is in thine own eye?

007:005 Thou hypocrite, first cast out the beam out of thine own eye;
        and then shalt thou see clearly to cast out the mote out of
        thy brother's eye.

007:006 Give not that which is holy unto the dogs, neither cast ye
        your pearls before swine, lest they trample them under their
        feet, and turn again and rend you.

007:007 Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find;
        knock, and it shall be opened unto you:

007:008 For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh
        findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be opened.

007:009 Or what man is there of you, whom if his son ask bread, will
        he give him a stone?

007:010 Or if he ask a fish, will he give him a serpent?

007:011 If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your
        children, how much more shall your Father which is in heaven
        give good things to them that ask him?

007:012 Therefore all things whatsoever ye would that men should do to
        you, do ye even so to them: for this is the law and the
        prophets.

007:013 Enter ye in at the strait gate: for wide is the gate, and
        broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many there
        be which go in thereat:

007:014 Because strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which
        leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it.

007:015 Beware of false prophets, which come to you in sheep's
        clothing, but inwardly they are ravening wolves.

007:016 Ye shall know them by their fruits. Do men gather grapes of
        thorns, or figs of thistles?

007:017 Even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruit; but a
        corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit.

007:018 A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can a
        corrupt tree bring forth good fruit.

007:019 Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down,
        and cast into the fire.

007:020 Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them.

007:021 Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into
        the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father
        which is in heaven.

007:022 Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not
        prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils?
        and in thy name done many wonderful works?

007:023 And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart
        from me, ye that work iniquity.

007:024 Therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth
        them, I will liken him unto a wise man, which built his house
        upon a rock:

007:025 And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds
        blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell not: for it was
        founded upon a rock.

007:026 And every one that heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth
        them not, shall be likened unto a foolish man, which built his
        house upon the sand:

007:027 And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds
        blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell: and great was the
        fall of it.

007:028 And it came to pass, when Jesus had ended these sayings, the
        people were astonished at his doctrine:

007:029 For he taught them as one having authority, and not as the
        scribes.

008:001 When he was come down from the mountain, great multitudes
        followed him.

008:002 And, behold, there came a leper and worshipped him, saying,
        Lord, if thou wilt, thou canst make me clean.

008:003 And Jesus put forth his hand, and touched him, saying, I will;
        be thou clean. And immediately his leprosy was cleansed.

008:004 And Jesus saith unto him, See thou tell no man; but go thy
        way, shew thyself to the priest, and offer the gift that Moses
        commanded, for a testimony unto them.

008:005 And when Jesus was entered into Capernaum, there came unto him
        a centurion, beseeching him,

008:006 And saying, Lord, my servant lieth at home sick of the palsy,
        grievously tormented.

008:007 And Jesus saith unto him, I will come and heal him.

008:008 The centurion answered and said, Lord, I am not worthy that
        thou shouldest come under my roof: but speak the word only,
        and my servant shall be healed.

008:009 For I am a man under authority, having soldiers under me: and
        I say to this man, Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and
        he cometh; and to my servant, Do this, and he doeth it.

008:010 When Jesus heard it, he marvelled, and said to them that
        followed, Verily I say unto you, I have not found so great
        faith, no, not in Israel.

008:011 And I say unto you, That many shall come from the east and
        west, and shall sit down with Abraham, and Isaac, and Jacob,
        in the kingdom of heaven.

008:012 But the children of the kingdom shall be cast out into outer
        darkness: there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.

008:013 And Jesus said unto the centurion, Go thy way; and as thou
        hast believed, so be it done unto thee. And his servant was
        healed in the selfsame hour.

008:014 And when Jesus was come into Peter's house, he saw his wife's
        mother laid, and sick of a fever.

008:015 And he touched her hand, and the fever left her: and she
        arose, and ministered unto them.

008:016 When the even was come, they brought unto him many that were
        possessed with devils: and he cast out the spirits with his
        word, and healed all that were sick:

008:017 That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the
        prophet, saying, Himself took our infirmities, and bare our
        sicknesses.

008:018 Now when Jesus saw great multitudes about him, he gave
        commandment to depart unto the other side.

008:019 And a certain scribe came, and said unto him, Master, I will
        follow thee whithersoever thou goest.

008:020 And Jesus saith unto him, The foxes have holes, and the birds
        of the air have nests; but the Son of man hath not where to
        lay his head.

008:021 And another of his disciples said unto him, Lord, suffer me
        first to go and bury my father.

008:022 But Jesus said unto him, Follow me; and let the dead bury
        their dead.

008:023 And when he was entered into a ship, his disciples followed
        him.

008:024 And, behold, there arose a great tempest in the sea, insomuch
        that the ship was covered with the waves: but he was asleep.

008:025 And his disciples came to him, and awoke him, saying, Lord,
        save us: we perish.

008:026 And he saith unto them, Why are ye fearful, O ye of little
        faith? Then he arose, and rebuked the winds and the sea; and
        there was a great calm.

008:027 But the men marvelled, saying, What manner of man is this,
        that even the winds and the sea obey him!

008:028 And when he was come to the other side into the country of the
        Gergesenes, there met him two possessed with devils, coming
        out of the tombs, exceeding fierce, so that no man might pass
        by that way.

008:029 And, behold, they cried out, saying, What have we to do with
        thee, Jesus, thou Son of God? art thou come hither to torment
        us before the time?

008:030 And there was a good way off from them an herd of many swine
        feeding.

008:031 So the devils besought him, saying, If thou cast us out,
        suffer us to go away into the herd of swine.

008:032 And he said unto them, Go. And when they were come out, they
        went into the herd of swine: and, behold, the whole herd of
        swine ran violently down a steep place into the sea, and
        perished in the waters.

008:033 And they that kept them fled, and went their ways into the
        city, and told every thing, and what was befallen to the
        possessed of the devils.

008:034 And, behold, the whole city came out to meet Jesus: and when
        they saw him, they besought him that he would depart out of
        their coasts.

009:001 And he entered into a ship, and passed over, and came into his
        own city.

009:002 And, behold, they brought to him a man sick of the palsy,
        lying on a bed: and Jesus seeing their faith said unto the
        sick of the palsy; Son, be of good cheer; thy sins be forgiven
        thee.

009:003 And, behold, certain of the scribes said within themselves,
        This man blasphemeth.

009:004 And Jesus knowing their thoughts said, Wherefore think ye evil
        in your hearts?

009:005 For whether is easier, to say, Thy sins be forgiven thee; or
        to say, Arise, and walk?

009:006 But that ye may know that the Son of man hath power on earth
        to forgive sins, (then saith he to the sick of the palsy,)
        Arise, take up thy bed, and go unto thine house.

009:007 And he arose, and departed to his house.

009:008 But when the multitudes saw it, they marvelled, and glorified
        God, which had given such power unto men.

009:009 And as Jesus passed forth from thence, he saw a man, named
        Matthew, sitting at the receipt of custom: and he saith unto
        him, Follow me. And he arose, and followed him.

009:010 And it came to pass, as Jesus sat at meat in the house,
        behold, many publicans and sinners came and sat down with him
        and his disciples.

009:011 And when the Pharisees saw it, they said unto his disciples,
        Why eateth your Master with publicans and sinners?

009:012 But when Jesus heard that, he said unto them, They that be
        whole need not a physician, but they that are sick.

009:013 But go ye and learn what that meaneth, I will have mercy, and
        not sacrifice: for I am not come to call the righteous, but
        sinners to repentance.

009:014 Then came to him the disciples of John, saying, Why do we and
        the Pharisees fast oft, but thy disciples fast not?

009:015 And Jesus said unto them, Can the children of the bridechamber
        mourn, as long as the bridegroom is with them? but the days
        will come, when the bridegroom shall be taken from them, and
        then shall they fast.

009:016 No man putteth a piece of new cloth unto an old garment, for
        that which is put in to fill it up taketh from the garment,
        and the rent is made worse.

009:017 Neither do men put new wine into old bottles: else the bottles
        break, and the wine runneth out, and the bottles perish: but
        they put new wine into new bottles, and both are preserved.

009:018 While he spake these things unto them, behold, there came a
        certain ruler, and worshipped him, saying, My daughter is even
        now dead: but come and lay thy hand upon her, and she shall
        live.

009:019 And Jesus arose, and followed him, and so did his disciples.

009:020 And, behold, a woman, which was diseased with an issue of
        blood twelve years, came behind him, and touched the hem of
        his garment:

009:021 For she said within herself, If I may but touch his garment, I
        shall be whole.

009:022 But Jesus turned him about, and when he saw her, he said,
        Daughter, be of good comfort; thy faith hath made thee whole.
        And the woman was made whole from that hour.

009:023 And when Jesus came into the ruler's house, and saw the
        minstrels and the people making a noise,

009:024 He said unto them, Give place: for the maid is not dead, but
        sleepeth. And they laughed him to scorn.

009:025 But when the people were put forth, he went in, and took her
        by the hand, and the maid arose.

009:026 And the fame hereof went abroad into all that land.

009:027 And when Jesus departed thence, two blind men followed him,
        crying, and saying, Thou son of David, have mercy on us.

009:028 And when he was come into the house, the blind men came to
        him: and Jesus saith unto them, Believe ye that I am able to
        do this? They said unto him, Yea, Lord.

009:029 Then touched he their eyes, saying, According to your faith be
        it unto you.

009:030 And their eyes were opened; and Jesus straitly charged them,
        saying, See that no man know it.

009:031 But they, when they were departed, spread abroad his fame in
        all that country.

009:032 As they went out, behold, they brought to him a dumb man
        possessed with a devil.

009:033 And when the devil was cast out, the dumb spake: and the
        multitudes marvelled, saying, It was never so seen in Israel.

009:034 But the Pharisees said, He casteth out devils through the
        prince of the devils.

009:035 And Jesus went about all the cities and villages, teaching in
        their synagogues, and preaching the gospel of the kingdom, and
        healing every sickness and every disease among the people.

009:036 But when he saw the multitudes, he was moved with compassion
        on them, because they fainted, and were scattered abroad, as
        sheep having no shepherd.

009:037 Then saith he unto his disciples, The harvest truly is
        plenteous, but the labourers are few;

009:038 Pray ye therefore the Lord of the harvest, that he will send
        forth labourers into his harvest.

010:001 And when he had called unto him his twelve disciples, he gave
        them power against unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to
        heal all manner of sickness and all manner of disease.

010:002 Now the names of the twelve apostles are these; The first,
        Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother; James the
        son of Zebedee, and John his brother;

010:003 Philip, and Bartholomew; Thomas, and Matthew the publican;
        James the son of Alphaeus, and Lebbaeus, whose surname was
        Thaddaeus;

010:004 Simon the Canaanite, and Judas Iscariot, who also betrayed
        him.

010:005 These twelve Jesus sent forth, and commanded them, saying, Go
        not into the way of the Gentiles, and into any city of the
        Samaritans enter ye not:

010:006 But go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.

010:007 And as ye go, preach, saying, The kingdom of heaven is at
        hand.

010:008 Heal the sick, cleanse the lepers, raise the dead, cast out
        devils: freely ye have received, freely give.

010:009 Provide neither gold, nor silver, nor brass in your purses,

010:010 Nor scrip for your journey, neither two coats, neither shoes,
        nor yet staves: for the workman is worthy of his meat.

010:011 And into whatsoever city or town ye shall enter, enquire who
        in it is worthy; and there abide till ye go thence.

010:012 And when ye come into an house, salute it.

010:013 And if the house be worthy, let your peace come upon it: but
        if it be not worthy, let your peace return to you.

010:014 And whosoever shall not receive you, nor hear your words, when
        ye depart out of that house or city, shake off the dust of
        your feet.

010:015 Verily I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for the land
        of Sodom and Gomorrha in the day of judgment, than for that
        city.

010:016 Behold, I send you forth as sheep in the midst of wolves: be
        ye therefore wise as serpents, and harmless as doves.

010:017 But beware of men: for they will deliver you up to the
        councils, and they will scourge you in their synagogues;

010:018 And ye shall be brought before governors and kings for my
        sake, for a testimony against them and the Gentiles.

010:019 But when they deliver you up, take no thought how or what ye
        shall speak: for it shall be given you in that same hour what
        ye shall speak.

010:020 For it is not ye that speak, but the Spirit of your Father
        which speaketh in you.

010:021 And the brother shall deliver up the brother to death, and the
        father the child: and the children shall rise up against their
        parents, and cause them to be put to death.

010:022 And ye shall be hated of all men for my name's sake: but he
        that endureth to the end shall be saved.

010:023 But when they persecute you in this city, flee ye into
        another: for verily I say unto you, Ye shall not have gone
        over the cities of Israel, till the Son of man be come.

010:024 The disciple is not above his master, nor the servant above
        his lord.

010:025 It is enough for the disciple that he be as his master, and
        the servant as his lord. If they have called the master of the
        house Beelzebub, how much more shall they call them of his
        household?

010:026 Fear them not therefore: for there is nothing covered, that
        shall not be revealed; and hid, that shall not be known.

010:027 What I tell you in darkness, that speak ye in light: and what
        ye hear in the ear, that preach ye upon the housetops.

010:028 And fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to
        kill the soul: but rather fear him which is able to destroy
        both soul and body in hell.

010:029 Are not two sparrows sold for a farthing? and one of them
        shall not fall on the ground without your Father.

010:030 But the very hairs of your head are all numbered.

010:031 Fear ye not therefore, ye are of more value than many
        sparrows.

010:032 Whosoever therefore shall confess me before men, him will I
        confess also before my Father which is in heaven.

010:033 But whosoever shall deny me before men, him will I also deny
        before my Father which is in heaven.

010:034 Think not that I am come to send peace on earth: I came not to
        send peace, but a sword.

010:035 For I am come to set a man at variance against his father, and
        the daughter against her mother, and the daughter in law
        against her mother in law.

010:036 And a man's foes shall be they of his own household.

010:037 He that loveth father or mother more than me is not worthy of
        me: and he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not
        worthy of me.

010:038 And he that taketh not his cross, and followeth after me, is
        not worthy of me.

010:039 He that findeth his life shall lose it: and he that loseth his
        life for my sake shall find it.

010:040 He that receiveth you receiveth me, and he that receiveth me
        receiveth him that sent me.

010:041 He that receiveth a prophet in the name of a prophet shall
        receive a prophet's reward; and he that receiveth a righteous
        man in the name of a righteous man shall receive a righteous
        man's reward.

010:042 And whosoever shall give to drink unto one of these little
        ones a cup of cold water only in the name of a disciple,
        verily I say unto you, he shall in no wise lose his reward.

011:001 And it came to pass, when Jesus had made an end of commanding
        his twelve disciples, he departed thence to teach and to
        preach in their cities.

011:002 Now when John had heard in the prison the works of Christ, he
        sent two of his disciples,

011:003 And said unto him, Art thou he that should come, or do we look
        for another?

011:004 Jesus answered and said unto them, Go and shew John again
        those things which ye do hear and see:

011:005 The blind receive their sight, and the lame walk, the lepers
        are cleansed, and the deaf hear, the dead are raised up, and
        the poor have the gospel preached to them.

011:006 And blessed is he, whosoever shall not be offended in me.

011:007 And as they departed, Jesus began to say unto the multitudes
        concerning John, What went ye out into the wilderness to see?
        A reed shaken with the wind?

011:008 But what went ye out for to see? A man clothed in soft
        raiment? behold, they that wear soft clothing are in kings'
        houses.

011:009 But what went ye out for to see? A prophet? yea, I say unto
        you, and more than a prophet.

011:010 For this is he, of whom it is written, Behold, I send my
        messenger before thy face, which shall prepare thy way before
        thee.

011:011 Verily I say unto you, Among them that are born of women there
        hath not risen a greater than John the Baptist:
        notwithstanding he that is least in the kingdom of heaven is
        greater than he.

011:012 And from the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of
        heaven suffereth violence, and the violent take it by force.

011:013 For all the prophets and the law prophesied until John.

011:014 And if ye will receive it, this is Elias, which was for to
        come.

011:015 He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.

011:016 But whereunto shall I liken this generation? It is like unto
        children sitting in the markets, and calling unto their
        fellows,

011:017 And saying, We have piped unto you, and ye have not danced; we
        have mourned unto you, and ye have not lamented.

011:018 For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, He
        hath a devil.

011:019 The Son of man came eating and drinking, and they say, Behold
        a man gluttonous, and a winebibber, a friend of publicans and
        sinners. But wisdom is justified of her children.

011:020 Then began he to upbraid the cities wherein most of his mighty
        works were done, because they repented not:

011:021 Woe unto thee, Chorazin! woe unto thee, Bethsaida! for if the
        mighty works, which were done in you, had been done in Tyre
        and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and
        ashes.

011:022 But I say unto you, It shall be more tolerable for Tyre and
        Sidon at the day of judgment, than for you.

011:023 And thou, Capernaum, which art exalted unto heaven, shalt be
        brought down to hell: for if the mighty works, which have been
        done in thee, had been done in Sodom, it would have remained
        until this day.

011:024 But I say unto you, That it shall be more tolerable for the
        land of Sodom in the day of judgment, than for thee.

011:025 At that time Jesus answered and said, I thank thee, O Father,
        Lord of heaven and earth, because thou hast hid these things
        from the wise and prudent, and hast revealed them unto babes.

011:026 Even so, Father: for so it seemed good in thy sight.

011:027 All things are delivered unto me of my Father: and no man
        knoweth the Son, but the Father; neither knoweth any man the
        Father, save the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son will reveal
        him.

011:028 Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I
        will give you rest.

011:029 Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and
        lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls.

011:030 For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light.

012:001 At that time Jesus went on the sabbath day through the corn;
        and his disciples were an hungred, and began to pluck the ears
        of corn and to eat.

012:002 But when the Pharisees saw it, they said unto him, Behold, thy
        disciples do that which is not lawful to do upon the sabbath
        day.

012:003 But he said unto them, Have ye not read what David did, when
        he was an hungred, and they that were with him;

012:004 How he entered into the house of God, and did eat the
        shewbread, which was not lawful for him to eat, neither for
        them which were with him, but only for the priests?

012:005 Or have ye not read in the law, how that on the sabbath days
        the priests in the temple profane the sabbath, and are
        blameless?

012:006 But I say unto you, That in this place is one greater than the
        temple.

012:007 But if ye had known what this meaneth, I will have mercy, and
        not sacrifice, ye would not have condemned the guiltless.

012:008 For the Son of man is Lord even of the sabbath day.

012:009 And when he was departed thence, he went into their synagogue:

012:010 And, behold, there was a man which had his hand withered. And
        they asked him, saying, Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath
        days? that they might accuse him.

012:011 And he said unto them, What man shall there be among you, that
        shall have one sheep, and if it fall into a pit on the sabbath
        day, will he not lay hold on it, and lift it out?

012:012 How much then is a man better than a sheep? Wherefore it is
        lawful to do well on the sabbath days.

012:013 Then saith he to the man, Stretch forth thine hand. And he
        stretched it forth; and it was restored whole, like as the
        other.

012:014 Then the Pharisees went out, and held a council against him,
        how they might destroy him.

012:015 But when Jesus knew it, he withdrew himself from thence: and
        great multitudes followed him, and he healed them all;

012:016 And charged them that they should not make him known:

012:017 That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Esaias the
        prophet, saying,

012:018 Behold my servant, whom I have chosen; my beloved, in whom my
        soul is well pleased: I will put my spirit upon him, and he
        shall shew judgment to the Gentiles.

012:019 He shall not strive, nor cry; neither shall any man hear his
        voice in the streets.

012:020 A bruised reed shall he not break, and smoking flax shall he
        not quench, till he send forth judgment unto victory.

012:021 And in his name shall the Gentiles trust.

012:022 Then was brought unto him one possessed with a devil, blind,
        and dumb: and he healed him, insomuch that the blind and dumb
        both spake and saw.

012:023 And all the people were amazed, and said, Is not this the son
        of David?

012:024 But when the Pharisees heard it, they said, This fellow doth
        not cast out devils, but by Beelzebub the prince of the
        devils.

012:025 And Jesus knew their thoughts, and said unto them, Every
        kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation; and
        every city or house divided against itself shall not stand:

012:026 And if Satan cast out Satan, he is divided against himself;
        how shall then his kingdom stand?

012:027 And if I by Beelzebub cast out devils, by whom do your
        children cast them out? therefore they shall be your judges.

012:028 But if I cast out devils by the Spirit of God, then the
        kingdom of God is come unto you.

012:029 Or else how can one enter into a strong man's house, and spoil
        his goods, except he first bind the strong man? and then he
        will spoil his house.

012:030 He that is not with me is against me; and he that gathereth
        not with me scattereth abroad.

012:031 Wherefore I say unto you, All manner of sin and blasphemy
        shall be forgiven unto men: but the blasphemy against the Holy
        Ghost shall not be forgiven unto men.

012:032 And whosoever speaketh a word against the Son of man, it shall
        be forgiven him: but whosoever speaketh against the Holy
        Ghost, it shall not be forgiven him, neither in this world,
        neither in the world to come.

012:033 Either make the tree good, and his fruit good; or else make
        the tree corrupt, and his fruit corrupt: for the tree is known
        by his fruit.

012:034 O generation of vipers, how can ye, being evil, speak good
        things? for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth
        speaketh.

012:035 A good man out of the good treasure of the heart bringeth
        forth good things: and an evil man out of the evil treasure
        bringeth forth evil things.

012:036 But I say unto you, That every idle word that men shall speak,
        they shall give account thereof in the day of judgment.

012:037 For by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words
        thou shalt be condemned.

012:038 Then certain of the scribes and of the Pharisees answered,
        saying, Master, we would see a sign from thee.

012:039 But he answered and said unto them, An evil and adulterous
        generation seeketh after a sign; and there shall no sign be
        given to it, but the sign of the prophet Jonas:

012:040 For as Jonas was three days and three nights in the whale's
        belly; so shall the Son of man be three days and three nights
        in the heart of the earth.

012:041 The men of Nineveh shall rise in judgment with this
        generation, and shall condemn it: because they repented at the
        preaching of Jonas; and, behold, a greater than Jonas is here.

012:042 The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with this
        generation, and shall condemn it: for she came from the
        uttermost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon;
        and, behold, a greater than Solomon is here.

012:043 When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh
        through dry places, seeking rest, and findeth none.

012:044 Then he saith, I will return into my house from whence I came
        out; and when he is come, he findeth it empty, swept, and
        garnished.

012:045 Then goeth he, and taketh with himself seven other spirits
        more wicked than himself, and they enter in and dwell there:
        and the last state of that man is worse than the first. Even
        so shall it be also unto this wicked generation.

012:046 While he yet talked to the people, behold, his mother and his
        brethren stood without, desiring to speak with him.

012:047 Then one said unto him, Behold, thy mother and thy brethren
        stand without, desiring to speak with thee.

012:048 But he answered and said unto him that told him, Who is my
        mother? and who are my brethren?

012:049 And he stretched forth his hand toward his disciples, and
        said, Behold my mother and my brethren!

012:050 For whosoever shall do the will of my Father which is in
        heaven, the same is my brother, and sister, and mother.

013:001 The same day went Jesus out of the house, and sat by the sea
        side.

013:002 And great multitudes were gathered together unto him, so that
        he went into a ship, and sat; and the whole multitude stood on
        the shore.

013:003 And he spake many things unto them in parables, saying,
        Behold, a sower went forth to sow;

013:004 And when he sowed, some seeds fell by the way side, and the
        fowls came and devoured them up:

013:005 Some fell upon stony places, where they had not much earth:
        and forthwith they sprung up, because they had no deepness of
        earth:

013:006 And when the sun was up, they were scorched; and because they
        had no root, they withered away.

013:007 And some fell among thorns; and the thorns sprung up, and
        choked them:

013:008 But other fell into good ground, and brought forth fruit, some
        an hundredfold, some sixtyfold, some thirtyfold.

013:009 Who hath ears to hear, let him hear.

013:010 And the disciples came, and said unto him, Why speakest thou
        unto them in parables?

013:011 He answered and said unto them, Because it is given unto you
        to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it
        is not given.

013:012 For whosoever hath, to him shall be given, and he shall have
        more abundance: but whosoever hath not, from him shall be
        taken away even that he hath.

013:013 Therefore speak I to them in parables: because they seeing see
        not; and hearing they hear not, neither do they understand.

013:014 And in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Esaias, which saith,
        By hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing
        ye shall see, and shall not perceive:

013:015 For this people's heart is waxed gross, and their ears are
        dull of hearing, and their eyes they have closed; lest at any
        time they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears,
        and should understand with their heart, and should be
        converted, and I should heal them.

013:016 But blessed are your eyes, for they see: and your ears, for
        they hear.

013:017 For verily I say unto you, That many prophets and righteous
        men have desired to see those things which ye see, and have
        not seen them; and to hear those things which ye hear, and
        have not heard them.

013:018 Hear ye therefore the parable of the sower.

013:019 When any one heareth the word of the kingdom, and
        understandeth it not, then cometh the wicked one, and catcheth
        away that which was sown in his heart. This is he which
        received seed by the way side.

013:020 But he that received the seed into stony places, the same is
        he that heareth the word, and anon with joy receiveth it;

013:021 Yet hath he not root in himself, but dureth for a while: for
        when tribulation or persecution ariseth because of the word,
        by and by he is offended.

013:022 He also that received seed among the thorns is he that heareth
        the word; and the care of this world, and the deceitfulness of
        riches, choke the word, and he becometh unfruitful.

013:023 But he that received seed into the good ground is he that
        heareth the word, and understandeth it; which also beareth
        fruit, and bringeth forth, some an hundredfold, some sixty,
        some thirty.

013:024 Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of
        heaven is likened unto a man which sowed good seed in his
        field:

013:025 But while men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares among the
        wheat, and went his way.

013:026 But when the blade was sprung up, and brought forth fruit,
        then appeared the tares also.

013:027 So the servants of the householder came and said unto him,
        Sir, didst not thou sow good seed in thy field? from whence
        then hath it tares?

013:028 He said unto them, An enemy hath done this. The servants said
        unto him, Wilt thou then that we go and gather them up?

013:029 But he said, Nay; lest while ye gather up the tares, ye root
        up also the wheat with them.

013:030 Let both grow together until the harvest: and in the time of
        harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather ye together first
        the tares, and bind them in bundles to burn them: but gather
        the wheat into my barn.

013:031 Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of
        heaven is like to a grain of mustard seed, which a man took,
        and sowed in his field:

013:032 Which indeed is the least of all seeds: but when it is grown,
        it is the greatest among herbs, and becometh a tree, so that
        the birds of the air come and lodge in the branches thereof.

013:033 Another parable spake he unto them; The kingdom of heaven is
        like unto leaven, which a woman took, and hid in three
        measures of meal, till the whole was leavened.

013:034 All these things spake Jesus unto the multitude in parables;
        and without a parable spake he not unto them:

013:035 That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet,
        saying, I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter things
        which have been kept secret from the foundation of the world.

013:036 Then Jesus sent the multitude away, and went into the house:
        and his disciples came unto him, saying, Declare unto us the
        parable of the tares of the field.

013:037 He answered and said unto them, He that soweth the good seed
        is the Son of man;

013:038 The field is the world; the good seed are the children of the
        kingdom; but the tares are the children of the wicked one;

013:039 The enemy that sowed them is the devil; the harvest is the end
        of the world; and the reapers are the angels.

013:040 As therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire; so
        shall it be in the end of this world.

013:041 The Son of man shall send forth his angels, and they shall
        gather out of his kingdom all things that offend, and them
        which do iniquity;

013:042 And shall cast them into a furnace of fire: there shall be
        wailing and gnashing of teeth.

013:043 Then shall the righteous shine forth as the sun in the kingdom
        of their Father. Who hath ears to hear, let him hear.

013:044 Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto treasure hid in a
        field; the which when a man hath found, he hideth, and for joy
        thereof goeth and selleth all that he hath, and buyeth that
        field.

013:045 Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a merchant man,
        seeking goodly pearls:

013:046 Who, when he had found one pearl of great price, went and sold
        all that he had, and bought it.

013:047 Again, the kingdom of heaven is like unto a net, that was cast
        into the sea, and gathered of every kind:

013:048 Which, when it was full, they drew to shore, and sat down, and
        gathered the good into vessels, but cast the bad away.

013:049 So shall it be at the end of the world: the angels shall come
        forth, and sever the wicked from among the just,

013:050 And shall cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be
        wailing and gnashing of teeth.

013:051 Jesus saith unto them, Have ye understood all these things?
        They say unto him, Yea, Lord.

013:052 Then said he unto them, Therefore every scribe which is
        instructed unto the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that
        is an householder, which bringeth forth out of his treasure
        things new and old.

013:053 And it came to pass, that when Jesus had finished these
        parables, he departed thence.

013:054 And when he was come into his own country, he taught them in
        their synagogue, insomuch that they were astonished, and said,
        Whence hath this man this wisdom, and these mighty works?

013:055 Is not this the carpenter's son? is not his mother called
        Mary? and his brethren, James, and Joses, and Simon, and
        Judas?

013:056 And his sisters, are they not all with us? Whence then hath
        this man all these things?

013:057 And they were offended in him. But Jesus said unto them, A
        prophet is not without honour, save in his own country, and in
        his own house.

013:058 And he did not many mighty works there because of their
        unbelief.

014:001 At that time Herod the tetrarch heard of the fame of Jesus,

014:002 And said unto his servants, This is John the Baptist; he is
        risen from the dead; and therefore mighty works do shew forth
        themselves in him.

014:003 For Herod had laid hold on John, and bound him, and put him in
        prison for Herodias' sake, his brother Philip's wife.

014:004 For John said unto him, It is not lawful for thee to have her.

014:005 And when he would have put him to death, he feared the
        multitude, because they counted him as a prophet.

014:006 But when Herod's birthday was kept, the daughter of Herodias
        danced before them, and pleased Herod.

014:007 Whereupon he promised with an oath to give her whatsoever she
        would ask.

014:008 And she, being before instructed of her mother, said, Give me
        here John Baptist's head in a charger.

014:009 And the king was sorry: nevertheless for the oath's sake, and
        them which sat with him at meat, he commanded it to be given
        her.

014:010 And he sent, and beheaded John in the prison.

014:011 And his head was brought in a charger, and given to the
        damsel: and she brought it to her mother.

014:012 And his disciples came, and took up the body, and buried it,
        and went and told Jesus.

014:013 When Jesus heard of it, he departed thence by ship into a
        desert place apart: and when the people had heard thereof,
        they followed him on foot out of the cities.

014:014 And Jesus went forth, and saw a great multitude, and was moved
        with compassion toward them, and he healed their sick.

014:015 And when it was evening, his disciples came to him, saying,
        This is a desert place, and the time is now past; send the
        multitude away, that they may go into the villages, and buy
        themselves victuals.

014:016 But Jesus said unto them, They need not depart; give ye them
        to eat.

014:017 And they say unto him, We have here but five loaves, and two
        fishes.

014:018 He said, Bring them hither to me.

014:019 And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the grass, and
        took the five loaves, and the two fishes, and looking up to
        heaven, he blessed, and brake, and gave the loaves to his
        disciples, and the disciples to the multitude.

014:020 And they did all eat, and were filled: and they took up of the
        fragments that remained twelve baskets full.

014:021 And they that had eaten were about five thousand men, beside
        women and children.

014:022 And straightway Jesus constrained his disciples to get into a
        ship, and to go before him unto the other side, while he sent
        the multitudes away.

014:023 And when he had sent the multitudes away, he went up into a
        mountain apart to pray: and when the evening was come, he was
        there alone.

014:024 But the ship was now in the midst of the sea, tossed with
        waves: for the wind was contrary.

014:025 And in the fourth watch of the night Jesus went unto them,
        walking on the sea.

014:026 And when the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were
        troubled, saying, It is a spirit; and they cried out for fear.

014:027 But straightway Jesus spake unto them, saying, Be of good
        cheer; it is I; be not afraid.

014:028 And Peter answered him and said, Lord, if it be thou, bid me
        come unto thee on the water.

014:029 And he said, Come. And when Peter was come down out of the
        ship, he walked on the water, to go to Jesus.

014:030 But when he saw the wind boisterous, he was afraid; and
        beginning to sink, he cried, saying, Lord, save me.

014:031 And immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand, and caught
        him, and said unto him, O thou of little faith, wherefore
        didst thou doubt?

014:032 And when they were come into the ship, the wind ceased.

014:033 Then they that were in the ship came and worshipped him,
        saying, Of a truth thou art the Son of God.

014:034 And when they were gone over, they came into the land of
        Gennesaret.

014:035 And when the men of that place had knowledge of him, they sent
        out into all that country round about, and brought unto him
        all that were diseased;

014:036 And besought him that they might only touch the hem of his
        garment: and as many as touched were made perfectly whole.

015:001 Then came to Jesus scribes and Pharisees, which were of
        Jerusalem, saying,

015:002 Why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders?
        for they wash not their hands when they eat bread.

015:003 But he answered and said unto them, Why do ye also transgress
        the commandment of God by your tradition?

015:004 For God commanded, saying, Honour thy father and mother: and,
        He that curseth father or mother, let him die the death.

015:005 But ye say, Whosoever shall say to his father or his mother,
        It is a gift, by whatsoever thou mightest be profited by me;

015:006 And honour not his father or his mother, he shall be free.
        Thus have ye made the commandment of God of none effect by
        your tradition.

015:007 Ye hypocrites, well did Esaias prophesy of you, saying,

015:008 This people draweth nigh unto me with their mouth, and
        honoureth me with their lips; but their heart is far from me.

015:009 But in vain they do worship me, teaching for doctrines the
        commandments of men.

015:010 And he called the multitude, and said unto them, Hear, and
        understand:

015:011 Not that which goeth into the mouth defileth a man; but that
        which cometh out of the mouth, this defileth a man.

015:012 Then came his disciples, and said unto him, Knowest thou that
        the Pharisees were offended, after they heard this saying?

015:013 But he answered and said, Every plant, which my heavenly
        Father hath not planted, shall be rooted up.

015:014 Let them alone: they be blind leaders of the blind. And if the
        blind lead the blind, both shall fall into the ditch.

015:015 Then answered Peter and said unto him, Declare unto us this
        parable.

015:016 And Jesus said, Are ye also yet without understanding?

015:017 Do not ye yet understand, that whatsoever entereth in at the
        mouth goeth into the belly, and is cast out into the draught?

015:018 But those things which proceed out of the mouth come forth
        from the heart; and they defile the man.

015:019 For out of the heart proceed evil thoughts, murders,
        adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witness, blasphemies:

015:020 These are the things which defile a man: but to eat with
        unwashen hands defileth not a man.

015:021 Then Jesus went thence, and departed into the coasts of Tyre
        and Sidon.

015:022 And, behold, a woman of Canaan came out of the same coasts,
        and cried unto him, saying, Have mercy on me, O Lord, thou son
        of David; my daughter is grievously vexed with a devil.

015:023 But he answered her not a word. And his disciples came and
        besought him, saying, Send her away; for she crieth after us.

015:024 But he answered and said, I am not sent but unto the lost
        sheep of the house of Israel.

015:025 Then came she and worshipped him, saying, Lord, help me.

015:026 But he answered and said, It is not meet to take the
        children's bread, and to cast it to dogs.

015:027 And she said, Truth, Lord: yet the dogs eat of the crumbs
        which fall from their masters' table.

015:028 Then Jesus answered and said unto her, O woman, great is thy
        faith: be it unto thee even as thou wilt. And her daughter was
        made whole from that very hour.

015:029 And Jesus departed from thence, and came nigh unto the sea of
        Galilee; and went up into a mountain, and sat down there.

015:030 And great multitudes came unto him, having with them those
        that were lame, blind, dumb, maimed, and many others, and cast
        them down at Jesus' feet; and he healed them:

015:031 Insomuch that the multitude wondered, when they saw the dumb
        to speak, the maimed to be whole, the lame to walk, and the
        blind to see: and they glorified the God of Israel.

015:032 Then Jesus called his disciples unto him, and said, I have
        compassion on the multitude, because they continue with me now
        three days, and have nothing to eat: and I will not send them
        away fasting, lest they faint in the way.

015:033 And his disciples say unto him, Whence should we have so much
        bread in the wilderness, as to fill so great a multitude?

015:034 And Jesus saith unto them, How many loaves have ye? And they
        said, Seven, and a few little fishes.

015:035 And he commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground.

015:036 And he took the seven loaves and the fishes, and gave thanks,
        and brake them, and gave to his disciples, and the disciples
        to the multitude.

015:037 And they did all eat, and were filled: and they took up of the
        broken meat that was left seven baskets full.

015:038 And they that did eat were four thousand men, beside women and
        children.

015:039 And he sent away the multitude, and took ship, and came into
        the coasts of Magdala.

016:001 The Pharisees also with the Sadducees came, and tempting
        desired him that he would shew them a sign from heaven.

016:002 He answered and said unto them, When it is evening, ye say, It
        will be fair weather: for the sky is red.

016:003 And in the morning, It will be foul weather to day: for the
        sky is red and lowering. O ye hypocrites, ye can discern the
        face of the sky; but can ye not discern the signs of the
        times?

016:004 A wicked and adulterous generation seeketh after a sign; and
        there shall no sign be given unto it, but the sign of the
        prophet Jonas. And he left them, and departed.

016:005 And when his disciples were come to the other side, they had
        forgotten to take bread.

016:006 Then Jesus said unto them, Take heed and beware of the leaven
        of the Pharisees and of the Sadducees.

016:007 And they reasoned among themselves, saying, It is because we
        have taken no bread.

016:008 Which when Jesus perceived, he said unto them, O ye of little
        faith, why reason ye among yourselves, because ye have brought
        no bread?

016:009 Do ye not yet understand, neither remember the five loaves of
        the five thousand, and how many baskets ye took up?

016:010 Neither the seven loaves of the four thousand, and how many
        baskets ye took up?

016:011 How is it that ye do not understand that I spake it not to you
        concerning bread, that ye should beware of the leaven of the
        Pharisees and of the Sadducees?

016:012 Then understood they how that he bade them not beware of the
        leaven of bread, but of the doctrine of the Pharisees and of
        the Sadducees.

016:013 When Jesus came into the coasts of Caesarea Philippi, he asked
        his disciples, saying, Whom do men say that I the Son of man
        am?

016:014 And they said, Some say that thou art John the Baptist: some,
        Elias; and others, Jeremias, or one of the prophets.

016:015 He saith unto them, But whom say ye that I am?

016:016 And Simon Peter answered and said, Thou art the Christ, the
        Son of the living God.

016:017 And Jesus answered and said unto him, Blessed art thou, Simon
        Barjona: for flesh and blood hath not revealed it unto thee,
        but my Father which is in heaven.

016:018 And I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this
        rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not
        prevail against it.

016:019 And I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven:
        and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in
        heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be
        loosed in heaven.

016:020 Then charged he his disciples that they should tell no man
        that he was Jesus the Christ.

016:021 From that time forth began Jesus to shew unto his disciples,
        how that he must go unto Jerusalem, and suffer many things of
        the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and
        be raised again the third day.

016:022 Then Peter took him, and began to rebuke him, saying, Be it
        far from thee, Lord: this shall not be unto thee.

016:023 But he turned, and said unto Peter, Get thee behind me, Satan:
        thou art an offence unto me: for thou savourest not the things
        that be of God, but those that be of men.

016:024 Then said Jesus unto his disciples, If any man will come after
        me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow
        me.

016:025 For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: and whosoever
        will lose his life for my sake shall find it.

016:026 For what is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world,
        and lose his own soul? or what shall a man give in exchange
        for his soul?

016:027 For the Son of man shall come in the glory of his Father with
        his angels; and then he shall reward every man according to
        his works.

016:028 Verily I say unto you, There be some standing here, which
        shall not taste of death, till they see the Son of man coming
        in his kingdom.

017:001 And after six days Jesus taketh Peter, James, and John his
        brother, and bringeth them up into an high mountain apart,

017:002 And was transfigured before them: and his face did shine as
        the sun, and his raiment was white as the light.

017:003 And, behold, there appeared unto them Moses and Elias talking
        with him.

017:004 Then answered Peter, and said unto Jesus, Lord, it is good for
        us to be here: if thou wilt, let us make here three
        tabernacles; one for thee, and one for Moses, and one for
        Elias.

017:005 While he yet spake, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them:
        and behold a voice out of the cloud, which said, This is my
        beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased; hear ye him.

017:006 And when the disciples heard it, they fell on their face, and
        were sore afraid.

017:007 And Jesus came and touched them, and said, Arise, and be not
        afraid.

017:008 And when they had lifted up their eyes, they saw no man, save
        Jesus only.

017:009 And as they came down from the mountain, Jesus charged them,
        saying, Tell the vision to no man, until the Son of man be
        risen again from the dead.

017:010 And his disciples asked him, saying, Why then say the scribes
        that Elias must first come?

017:011 And Jesus answered and said unto them, Elias truly shall first
        come, and restore all things.

017:012 But I say unto you, That Elias is come already, and they knew
        him not, but have done unto him whatsoever they listed.
        Likewise shall also the Son of man suffer of them.

017:013 Then the disciples understood that he spake unto them of John
        the Baptist.

017:014 And when they were come to the multitude, there came to him a
        certain man, kneeling down to him, and saying,

017:015 Lord, have mercy on my son: for he is lunatick, and sore
        vexed: for ofttimes he falleth into the fire, and oft into the
        water.

017:016 And I brought him to thy disciples, and they could not cure
        him.

017:017 Then Jesus answered and said, O faithless and perverse
        generation, how long shall I be with you? how long shall I
        suffer you? bring him hither to me.

017:018 And Jesus rebuked the devil; and he departed out of him: and
        the child was cured from that very hour.

017:019 Then came the disciples to Jesus apart, and said, Why could
        not we cast him out?

017:020 And Jesus said unto them, Because of your unbelief: for verily
        I say unto you, If ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed,
        ye shall say unto this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place;
        and it shall remove; and nothing shall be impossible unto you.

017:021 Howbeit this kind goeth not out but by prayer and fasting.

017:022 And while they abode in Galilee, Jesus said unto them, The Son
        of man shall be betrayed into the hands of men:

017:023 And they shall kill him, and the third day he shall be raised
        again. And they were exceeding sorry.

017:024 And when they were come to Capernaum, they that received
        tribute money came to Peter, and said, Doth not your master
        pay tribute?

017:025 He saith, Yes. And when he was come into the house, Jesus
        prevented him, saying, What thinkest thou, Simon? of whom do
        the kings of the earth take custom or tribute? of their own
        children, or of strangers?

017:026 Peter saith unto him, Of strangers. Jesus saith unto him, Then
        are the children free.

017:027 Notwithstanding, lest we should offend them, go thou to the
        sea, and cast an hook, and take up the fish that first cometh
        up; and when thou hast opened his mouth, thou shalt find a
        piece of money: that take, and give unto them for me and thee.

018:001 At the same time came the disciples unto Jesus, saying, Who is
        the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?

018:002 And Jesus called a little child unto him, and set him in the
        midst of them,

018:003 And said, Verily I say unto you, Except ye be converted, and
        become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom
        of heaven.

018:004 Whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child,
        the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven.

018:005 And whoso shall receive one such little child in my name
        receiveth me.

018:006 But whoso shall offend one of these little ones which believe
        in me, it were better for him that a millstone were hanged
        about his neck, and that he were drowned in the depth of the
        sea.

018:007 Woe unto the world because of offences! for it must needs be
        that offences come; but woe to that man by whom the offence
        cometh!

018:008 Wherefore if thy hand or thy foot offend thee, cut them off,
        and cast them from thee: it is better for thee to enter into
        life halt or maimed, rather than having two hands or two feet
        to be cast into everlasting fire.

018:009 And if thine eye offend thee, pluck it out, and cast it from
        thee: it is better for thee to enter into life with one eye,
        rather than having two eyes to be cast into hell fire.

018:010 Take heed that ye despise not one of these little ones; for I
        say unto you, That in heaven their angels do always behold the
        face of my Father which is in heaven.

018:011 For the Son of man is come to save that which was lost.

018:012 How think ye? if a man have an hundred sheep, and one of them
        be gone astray, doth he not leave the ninety and nine, and
        goeth into the mountains, and seeketh that which is gone
        astray?

018:013 And if so be that he find it, verily I say unto you, he
        rejoiceth more of that sheep, than of the ninety and nine
        which went not astray.

018:014 Even so it is not the will of your Father which is in heaven,
        that one of these little ones should perish.

018:015 Moreover if thy brother shall trespass against thee, go and
        tell him his fault between thee and him alone: if he shall
        hear thee, thou hast gained thy brother.

018:016 But if he will not hear thee, then take with thee one or two
        more, that in the mouth of two or three witnesses every word
        may be established.

018:017 And if he shall neglect to hear them, tell it unto the church:
        but if he neglect to hear the church, let him be unto thee as
        an heathen man and a publican.

018:018 Verily I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall
        be bound in heaven: and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth
        shall be loosed in heaven.

018:019 Again I say unto you, That if two of you shall agree on earth
        as touching any thing that they shall ask, it shall be done
        for them of my Father which is in heaven.

018:020 For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there
        am I in the midst of them.

018:021 Then came Peter to him, and said, Lord, how oft shall my
        brother sin against me, and I forgive him? till seven times?

018:022 Jesus saith unto him, I say not unto thee, Until seven times:
        but, Until seventy times seven.

018:023 Therefore is the kingdom of heaven likened unto a certain
        king, which would take account of his servants.

018:024 And when he had begun to reckon, one was brought unto him,
        which owed him ten thousand talents.

018:025 But forasmuch as he had not to pay, his lord commanded him to
        be sold, and his wife, and children, and all that he had, and
        payment to be made.

018:026 The servant therefore fell down, and worshipped him, saying,
        Lord, have patience with me, and I will pay thee all.

018:027 Then the lord of that servant was moved with compassion, and
        loosed him, and forgave him the debt.

018:028 But the same servant went out, and found one of his
        fellowservants, which owed him an hundred pence: and he laid
        hands on him, and took him by the throat, saying, Pay me that
        thou owest.

018:029 And his fellowservant fell down at his feet, and besought him,
        saying, Have patience with me, and I will pay thee all.

018:030 And he would not: but went and cast him into prison, till he
        should pay the debt.

018:031 So when his fellowservants saw what was done, they were very
        sorry, and came and told unto their lord all that was done.

018:032 Then his lord, after that he had called him, said unto him, O
        thou wicked servant, I forgave thee all that debt, because
        thou desiredst me:

018:033 Shouldest not thou also have had compassion on thy
        fellowservant, even as I had pity on thee?

018:034 And his lord was wroth, and delivered him to the tormentors,
        till he should pay all that was due unto him.

018:035 So likewise shall my heavenly Father do also unto you, if ye
        from your hearts forgive not every one his brother their
        trespasses.

019:001 And it came to pass, that when Jesus had finished these
        sayings, he departed from Galilee, and came into the coasts of
        Judaea beyond Jordan;

019:002 And great multitudes followed him; and he healed them there.

019:003 The Pharisees also came unto him, tempting him, and saying
        unto him, Is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for
        every cause?

019:004 And he answered and said unto them, Have ye not read, that he
        which made them at the beginning made them male and female,

019:005 And said, For this cause shall a man leave father and mother,
        and shall cleave to his wife: and they twain shall be one
        flesh?

019:006 Wherefore they are no more twain, but one flesh. What
        therefore God hath joined together, let not man put asunder.

019:007 They say unto him, Why did Moses then command to give a
        writing of divorcement, and to put her away?

019:008 He saith unto them, Moses because of the hardness of your
        hearts suffered you to put away your wives: but from the
        beginning it was not so.

019:009 And I say unto you, Whosoever shall put away his wife, except
        it be for fornication, and shall marry another, committeth
        adultery: and whoso marrieth her which is put away doth commit
        adultery.

019:010 His disciples say unto him, If the case of the man be so with
        his wife, it is not good to marry.

019:011 But he said unto them, All men cannot receive this saying,
        save they to whom it is given.

019:012 For there are some eunuchs, which were so born from their
        mother's womb: and there are some eunuchs, which were made
        eunuchs of men: and there be eunuchs, which have made
        themselves eunuchs for the kingdom of heaven's sake. He that
        is able to receive it, let him receive it.

019:013 Then were there brought unto him little children, that he
        should put his hands on them, and pray: and the disciples
        rebuked them.

019:014 But Jesus said, Suffer little children, and forbid them not,
        to come unto me: for of such is the kingdom of heaven.

019:015 And he laid his hands on them, and departed thence.

019:016 And, behold, one came and said unto him, Good Master, what
        good thing shall I do, that I may have eternal life?

019:017 And he said unto him, Why callest thou me good? there is none
        good but one, that is, God: but if thou wilt enter into life,
        keep the commandments.

019:018 He saith unto him, Which? Jesus said, Thou shalt do no murder,
        Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not steal, Thou
        shalt not bear false witness,

019:019 Honour thy father and thy mother: and, Thou shalt love thy
        neighbour as thyself.

019:020 The young man saith unto him, All these things have I kept
        from my youth up: what lack I yet?

019:021 Jesus said unto him, If thou wilt be perfect, go and sell that
        thou hast, and give to the poor, and thou shalt have treasure
        in heaven: and come and follow me.

019:022 But when the young man heard that saying, he went away
        sorrowful: for he had great possessions.

019:023 Then said Jesus unto his disciples, Verily I say unto you,
        That a rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven.

019:024 And again I say unto you, It is easier for a camel to go
        through the eye of a needle, than for a rich man to enter into
        the kingdom of God.

019:025 When his disciples heard it, they were exceedingly amazed,
        saying, Who then can be saved?

019:026 But Jesus beheld them, and said unto them, With men this is
        impossible; but with God all things are possible.

019:027 Then answered Peter and said unto him, Behold, we have
        forsaken all, and followed thee; what shall we have therefore?

019:028 And Jesus said unto them, Verily I say unto you, That ye which
        have followed me, in the regeneration when the Son of man
        shall sit in the throne of his glory, ye also shall sit upon
        twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.

019:029 And every one that hath forsaken houses, or brethren, or
        sisters, or father, or mother, or wife, or children, or lands,
        for my name's sake, shall receive an hundredfold, and shall
        inherit everlasting life.

019:030 But many that are first shall be last; and the last shall be
        first.

020:001 For the kingdom of heaven is like unto a man that is an
        householder, which went out early in the morning to hire
        labourers into his vineyard.

020:002 And when he had agreed with the labourers for a penny a day,
        he sent them into his vineyard.

020:003 And he went out about the third hour, and saw others standing
        idle in the marketplace,

020:004 And said unto them; Go ye also into the vineyard, and
        whatsoever is right I will give you. And they went their way.

020:005 Again he went out about the sixth and ninth hour, and did
        likewise.

020:006 And about the eleventh hour he went out, and found others
        standing idle, and saith unto them, Why stand ye here all the
        day idle?

020:007 They say unto him, Because no man hath hired us. He saith unto
        them, Go ye also into the vineyard; and whatsoever is right,
        that shall ye receive.

020:008 So when even was come, the lord of the vineyard saith unto his
        steward, Call the labourers, and give them their hire,
        beginning from the last unto the first.

020:009 And when they came that were hired about the eleventh hour,
        they received every man a penny.

020:010 But when the first came, they supposed that they should have
        received more; and they likewise received every man a penny.

020:011 And when they had received it, they murmured against the
        goodman of the house,

020:012 Saying, These last have wrought but one hour, and thou hast
        made them equal unto us, which have borne the burden and heat
        of the day.

020:013 But he answered one of them, and said, Friend, I do thee no
        wrong: didst not thou agree with me for a penny?

020:014 Take that thine is, and go thy way: I will give unto this
        last, even as unto thee.

020:015 Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with mine own? Is
        thine eye evil, because I am good?

020:016 So the last shall be first, and the first last: for many be
        called, but few chosen.

020:017 And Jesus going up to Jerusalem took the twelve disciples
        apart in the way, and said unto them,

020:018 Behold, we go up to Jerusalem; and the Son of man shall be
        betrayed unto the chief priests and unto the scribes, and they
        shall condemn him to death,

020:019 And shall deliver him to the Gentiles to mock, and to scourge,
        and to crucify him: and the third day he shall rise again.

020:020 Then came to him the mother of Zebedees children with her
        sons, worshipping him, and desiring a certain thing of him.

020:021 And he said unto her, What wilt thou? She saith unto him,
        Grant that these my two sons may sit, the one on thy right
        hand, and the other on the left, in thy kingdom.

020:022 But Jesus answered and said, Ye know not what ye ask. Are ye
        able to drink of the cup that I shall drink of, and to be
        baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with? They say
        unto him, We are able.

020:023 And he saith unto them, Ye shall drink indeed of my cup, and
        be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with: but to
        sit on my right hand, and on my left, is not mine to give, but
        it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared of my
        Father.

020:024 And when the ten heard it, they were moved with indignation
        against the two brethren.

020:025 But Jesus called them unto him, and said, Ye know that the
        princes of the Gentiles exercise dominion over them, and they
        that are great exercise authority upon them.

020:026 But it shall not be so among you: but whosoever will be great
        among you, let him be your minister;

020:027 And whosoever will be chief among you, let him be your
        servant:

020:028 Even as the Son of man came not to be ministered unto, but to
        minister, and to give his life a ransom for many.

020:029 And as they departed from Jericho, a great multitude followed
        him.

020:030 And, behold, two blind men sitting by the way side, when they
        heard that Jesus passed by, cried out, saying, Have mercy on
        us, O Lord, thou son of David.

020:031 And the multitude rebuked them, because they should hold their
        peace: but they cried the more, saying, Have mercy on us, O
        Lord, thou son of David.

020:032 And Jesus stood still, and called them, and said, What will ye
        that I shall do unto you?

020:033 They say unto him, Lord, that our eyes may be opened.

020:034 So Jesus had compassion on them, and touched their eyes: and
        immediately their eyes received sight, and they followed him.

021:001 And when they drew nigh unto Jerusalem, and were come to
        Bethphage, unto the mount of Olives, then sent Jesus two
        disciples,

021:002 Saying unto them, Go into the village over against you, and
        straightway ye shall find an ass tied, and a colt with her:
        loose them, and bring them unto me.

021:003 And if any man say ought unto you, ye shall say, The Lord hath
        need of them; and straightway he will send them.

021:004 All this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken
        by the prophet, saying,

021:005 Tell ye the daughter of Sion, Behold, thy King cometh unto
        thee, meek, and sitting upon an ass, and a colt the foal of an
        ass.

021:006 And the disciples went, and did as Jesus commanded them,

021:007 And brought the ass, and the colt, and put on them their
        clothes, and they set him thereon.

021:008 And a very great multitude spread their garments in the way;
        others cut down branches from the trees, and strawed them in
        the way.

021:009 And the multitudes that went before, and that followed, cried,
        saying, Hosanna to the son of David: Blessed is he that cometh
        in the name of the Lord; Hosanna in the highest.

021:010 And when he was come into Jerusalem, all the city was moved,
        saying, Who is this?

021:011 And the multitude said, This is Jesus the prophet of Nazareth
        of Galilee.

021:012 And Jesus went into the temple of God, and cast out all them
        that sold and bought in the temple, and overthrew the tables
        of the moneychangers, and the seats of them that sold doves,

021:013 And said unto them, It is written, My house shall be called
        the house of prayer; but ye have made it a den of thieves.

021:014 And the blind and the lame came to him in the temple; and he
        healed them.

021:015 And when the chief priests and scribes saw the wonderful
        things that he did, and the children crying in the temple, and
        saying, Hosanna to the son of David; they were sore
        displeased,

021:016 And said unto him, Hearest thou what these say? And Jesus
        saith unto them, Yea; have ye never read, Out of the mouth of
        babes and sucklings thou hast perfected praise?

021:017 And he left them, and went out of the city into Bethany; and
        he lodged there.

021:018 Now in the morning as he returned into the city, he hungered.

021:019 And when he saw a fig tree in the way, he came to it, and
        found nothing thereon, but leaves only, and said unto it, Let
        no fruit grow on thee henceforward for ever. And presently the
        fig tree withered away.

021:020 And when the disciples saw it, they marvelled, saying, How
        soon is the fig tree withered away!

021:021 Jesus answered and said unto them, Verily I say unto you, If
        ye have faith, and doubt not, ye shall not only do this which
        is done to the fig tree, but also if ye shall say unto this
        mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the sea; it
        shall be done.

021:022 And all things, whatsoever ye shall ask in prayer, believing,
        ye shall receive.

021:023 And when he was come into the temple, the chief priests and
        the elders of the people came unto him as he was teaching, and
        said, By what authority doest thou these things? and who gave
        thee this authority?

021:024 And Jesus answered and said unto them, I also will ask you one
        thing, which if ye tell me, I in like wise will tell you by
        what authority I do these things.

021:025 The baptism of John, whence was it? from heaven, or of men?
        And they reasoned with themselves, saying, If we shall say,
        From heaven; he will say unto us, Why did ye not then believe
        him?

021:026 But if we shall say, Of men; we fear the people; for all hold
        John as a prophet.

021:027 And they answered Jesus, and said, We cannot tell. And he said
        unto them, Neither tell I you by what authority I do these
        things.

021:028 But what think ye? A certain man had two sons; and he came to
        the first, and said, Son, go work to day in my vineyard.

021:029 He answered and said, I will not: but afterward he repented,
        and went.

021:030 And he came to the second, and said likewise. And he answered
        and said, I go, sir: and went not.

021:031 Whether of them twain did the will of his father? They say
        unto him, The first. Jesus saith unto them, Verily I say unto
        you, That the publicans and the harlots go into the kingdom of
        God before you.

021:032 For John came unto you in the way of righteousness, and ye
        believed him not: but the publicans and the harlots believed
        him: and ye, when ye had seen it, repented not afterward, that
        ye might believe him.

021:033 Hear another parable: There was a certain householder, which
        planted a vineyard, and hedged it round about, and digged a
        winepress in it, and built a tower, and let it out to
        husbandmen, and went into a far country:

021:034 And when the time of the fruit drew near, he sent his servants
        to the husbandmen, that they might receive the fruits of it.

021:035 And the husbandmen took his servants, and beat one, and killed
        another, and stoned another.

021:036 Again, he sent other servants more than the first: and they
        did unto them likewise.

021:037 But last of all he sent unto them his son, saying, They will
        reverence my son.

021:038 But when the husbandmen saw the son, they said among
        themselves, This is the heir; come, let us kill him, and let
        us seize on his inheritance.

021:039 And they caught him, and cast him out of the vineyard, and
        slew him.

021:040 When the lord therefore of the vineyard cometh, what will he
        do unto those husbandmen?

021:041 They say unto him, He will miserably destroy those wicked men,
        and will let out his vineyard unto other husbandmen, which
        shall render him the fruits in their seasons.

021:042 Jesus saith unto them, Did ye never read in the scriptures,
        The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the
        head of the corner: this is the Lord's doing, and it is
        marvellous in our eyes?

021:043 Therefore say I unto you, The kingdom of God shall be taken
        from you, and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits
        thereof.

021:044 And whosoever shall fall on this stone shall be broken: but on
        whomsoever it shall fall, it will grind him to powder.

021:045 And when the chief priests and Pharisees had heard his
        parables, they perceived that he spake of them.

021:046 But when they sought to lay hands on him, they feared the
        multitude, because they took him for a prophet.

022:001 And Jesus answered and spake unto them again by parables, and
        said,

022:002 The kingdom of heaven is like unto a certain king, which made
        a marriage for his son,

022:003 And sent forth his servants to call them that were bidden to
        the wedding: and they would not come.

022:004 Again, he sent forth other servants, saying, Tell them which
        are bidden, Behold, I have prepared my dinner: my oxen and my
        fatlings are killed, and all things are ready: come unto the
        marriage.

022:005 But they made light of it, and went their ways, one to his
        farm, another to his merchandise:

022:006 And the remnant took his servants, and entreated them
        spitefully, and slew them.

022:007 But when the king heard thereof, he was wroth: and he sent
        forth his armies, and destroyed those murderers, and burned up
        their city.

022:008 Then saith he to his servants, The wedding is ready, but they
        which were bidden were not worthy.

022:009 Go ye therefore into the highways, and as many as ye shall
        find, bid to the marriage.

022:010 So those servants went out into the highways, and gathered
        together all as many as they found, both bad and good: and the
        wedding was furnished with guests.

022:011 And when the king came in to see the guests, he saw there a
        man which had not on a wedding garment:

022:012 And he saith unto him, Friend, how camest thou in hither not
        having a wedding garment? And he was speechless.

022:013 Then said the king to the servants, Bind him hand and foot,
        and take him away, and cast him into outer darkness, there
        shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth.

022:014 For many are called, but few are chosen.

022:015 Then went the Pharisees, and took counsel how they might
        entangle him in his talk.

022:016 And they sent out unto him their disciples with the Herodians,
        saying, Master, we know that thou art true, and teachest the
        way of God in truth, neither carest thou for any man: for thou
        regardest not the person of men.

022:017 Tell us therefore, What thinkest thou? Is it lawful to give
        tribute unto Caesar, or not?

022:018 But Jesus perceived their wickedness, and said, Why tempt ye
        me, ye hypocrites?

022:019 Shew me the tribute money. And they brought unto him a penny.

022:020 And he saith unto them, Whose is this image and
        superscription?

022:021 They say unto him, Caesar's. Then saith he unto them, Render
        therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's; and unto
        God the things that are God's.

022:022 When they had heard these words, they marvelled, and left him,
        and went their way.

022:023 The same day came to him the Sadducees, which say that there
        is no resurrection, and asked him,

022:024 Saying, Master, Moses said, If a man die, having no children,
        his brother shall marry his wife, and raise up seed unto his
        brother.

022:025 Now there were with us seven brethren: and the first, when he
        had married a wife, deceased, and, having no issue, left his
        wife unto his brother:

022:026 Likewise the second also, and the third, unto the seventh.

022:027 And last of all the woman died also.

022:028 Therefore in the resurrection whose wife shall she be of the
        seven? for they all had her.

022:029 Jesus answered and said unto them, Ye do err, not knowing the
        scriptures, nor the power of God.

022:030 For in the resurrection they neither marry, nor are given in
        marriage, but are as the angels of God in heaven.

022:031 But as touching the resurrection of the dead, have ye not read
        that which was spoken unto you by God, saying,

022:032 I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of
        Jacob? God is not the God of the dead, but of the living.

022:033 And when the multitude heard this, they were astonished at his
        doctrine.

022:034 But when the Pharisees had heard that he had put the Sadducees
        to silence, they were gathered together.

022:035 Then one of them, which was a lawyer, asked him a question,
        tempting him, and saying,

022:036 Master, which is the great commandment in the law?

022:037 Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all
        thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind.

022:038 This is the first and great commandment.

022:039 And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour
        as thyself.

022:040 On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.

022:041 While the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them,

022:042 Saying, What think ye of Christ? whose son is he? They say
        unto him, The son of David.

022:043 He saith unto them, How then doth David in spirit call him
        Lord, saying,

022:044 The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, till I
        make thine enemies thy footstool?

022:045 If David then call him Lord, how is he his son?

022:046 And no man was able to answer him a word, neither durst any
        man from that day forth ask him any more questions.

023:001 Then spake Jesus to the multitude, and to his disciples,

023:002 Saying The scribes and the Pharisees sit in Moses' seat:

023:003 All therefore whatsoever they bid you observe, that observe
        and do; but do not ye after their works: for they say, and do
        not.

023:004 For they bind heavy burdens and grievous to be borne, and lay
        them on men's shoulders; but they themselves will not move
        them with one of their fingers.

023:005 But all their works they do for to be seen of men: they make
        broad their phylacteries, and enlarge the borders of their
        garments,

023:006 And love the uppermost rooms at feasts, and the chief seats in
        the synagogues,

023:007 And greetings in the markets, and to be called of men, Rabbi,
        Rabbi.

023:008 But be not ye called Rabbi: for one is your Master, even
        Christ; and all ye are brethren.

023:009 And call no man your father upon the earth: for one is your
        Father, which is in heaven.

023:010 Neither be ye called masters: for one is your Master, even
        Christ.

023:011 But he that is greatest among you shall be your servant.

023:012 And whosoever shall exalt himself shall be abased; and he that
        shall humble himself shall be exalted.

023:013 But woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye
        shut up the kingdom of heaven against men: for ye neither go
        in yourselves, neither suffer ye them that are entering to go
        in.

023:014 Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye devour
        widows' houses, and for a pretence make long prayer: therefore
        ye shall receive the greater damnation.

023:015 Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye
        compass sea and land to make one proselyte, and when he is
        made, ye make him twofold more the child of hell than
        yourselves.

023:016 Woe unto you, ye blind guides, which say, Whosoever shall
        swear by the temple, it is nothing; but whosoever shall swear
        by the gold of the temple, he is a debtor!

023:017 Ye fools and blind: for whether is greater, the gold, or the
        temple that sanctifieth the gold?

023:018 And, Whosoever shall swear by the altar, it is nothing; but
        whosoever sweareth by the gift that is upon it, he is guilty.

023:019 Ye fools and blind: for whether is greater, the gift, or the
        altar that sanctifieth the gift?

023:020 Whoso therefore shall swear by the altar, sweareth by it, and
        by all things thereon.

023:021 And whoso shall swear by the temple, sweareth by it, and by
        him that dwelleth therein.

023:022 And he that shall swear by heaven, sweareth by the throne of
        God, and by him that sitteth thereon.

023:023 Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye pay
        tithe of mint and anise and cummin, and have omitted the
        weightier matters of the law, judgment, mercy, and faith:
        these ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other
        undone.

023:024 Ye blind guides, which strain at a gnat, and swallow a camel.

023:025 Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye make
        clean the outside of the cup and of the platter, but within
        they are full of extortion and excess.

023:026 Thou blind Pharisee, cleanse first that which is within the
        cup and platter, that the outside of them may be clean also.

023:027 Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are
        like unto whited sepulchres, which indeed appear beautiful
        outward, but are within full of dead men's bones, and of all
        uncleanness.

023:028 Even so ye also outwardly appear righteous unto men, but
        within ye are full of hypocrisy and iniquity.

023:029 Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! because ye
        build the tombs of the prophets, and garnish the sepulchres of
        the righteous,
