023:006 And he brought out the grove from the house of the LORD,
        without Jerusalem, unto the brook Kidron, and burned it at the
        brook Kidron, and stamped it small to powder, and cast the
        powder thereof upon the graves of the children of the people.

023:007 And he brake down the houses of the sodomites, that were by
        the house of the LORD, where the women wove hangings for the
        grove.

023:008 And he brought all the priests out of the cities of Judah, and
        defiled the high places where the priests had burned incense,
        from Geba to Beersheba, and brake down the high places of the
        gates that were in the entering in of the gate of Joshua the
        governor of the city, which were on a man's left hand at the
        gate of the city.

023:009 Nevertheless the priests of the high places came not up to the
        altar of the LORD in Jerusalem, but they did eat of the
        unleavened bread among their brethren.

023:010 And he defiled Topheth, which is in the valley of the children
        of Hinnom, that no man might make his son or his daughter to
        pass through the fire to Molech.

023:011 And he took away the horses that the kings of Judah had given
        to the sun, at the entering in of the house of the LORD, by
        the chamber of Nathanmelech the chamberlain, which was in the
        suburbs, and burned the chariots of the sun with fire.

023:012 And the altars that were on the top of the upper chamber of
        Ahaz, which the kings of Judah had made, and the altars which
        Manasseh had made in the two courts of the house of the LORD,
        did the king beat down, and brake them down from thence, and
        cast the dust of them into the brook Kidron.

023:013 And the high places that were before Jerusalem, which were on
        the right hand of the mount of corruption, which Solomon the
        king of Israel had builded for Ashtoreth the abomination of
        the Zidonians, and for Chemosh the abomination of the
        Moabites, and for Milcom the abomination of the children of
        Ammon, did the king defile.

023:014 And he brake in pieces the images, and cut down the groves,
        and filled their places with the bones of men.

023:015 Moreover the altar that was at Bethel, and the high place
        which Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin, had
        made, both that altar and the high place he brake down, and
        burned the high place, and stamped it small to powder, and
        burned the grove.

023:016 And as Josiah turned himself, he spied the sepulchres that
        were there in the mount, and sent, and took the bones out of
        the sepulchres, and burned them upon the altar, and polluted
        it, according to the word of the LORD which the man of God
        proclaimed, who proclaimed these words.

023:017 Then he said, What title is that that I see? And the men of
        the city told him, It is the sepulchre of the man of God,
        which came from Judah, and proclaimed these things that thou
        hast done against the altar of Bethel.

023:018 And he said, Let him alone; let no man move his bones. So they
        let his bones alone, with the bones of the prophet that came
        out of Samaria.

023:019 And all the houses also of the high places that were in the
        cities of Samaria, which the kings of Israel had made to
        provoke the Lord to anger, Josiah took away, and did to them
        according to all the acts that he had done in Bethel.

023:020 And he slew all the priests of the high places that were there
        upon the altars, and burned men's bones upon them, and
        returned to Jerusalem.

023:021 And the king commanded all the people, saying, Keep the
        passover unto the LORD your God, as it is written in the book
        of this covenant.

023:022 Surely there was not holden such a passover from the days of
        the judges that judged Israel, nor in all the days of the
        kings of Israel, nor of the kings of Judah;

023:023 But in the eighteenth year of king Josiah, wherein this
        passover was holden to the LORD in Jerusalem.

023:024 Moreover the workers with familiar spirits, and the wizards,
        and the images, and the idols, and all the abominations that
        were spied in the land of Judah and in Jerusalem, did Josiah
        put away, that he might perform the words of the law which
        were written in the book that Hilkiah the priest found in the
        house of the LORD.

023:025 And like unto him was there no king before him, that turned to
        the LORD with all his heart, and with all his soul, and with
        all his might, according to all the law of Moses; neither
        after him arose there any like him.

023:026 Notwithstanding the LORD turned not from the fierceness of his
        great wrath, wherewith his anger was kindled against Judah,
        because of all the provocations that Manasseh had provoked him
        withal.

023:027 And the LORD said, I will remove Judah also out of my sight,
        as I have removed Israel, and will cast off this city
        Jerusalem which I have chosen, and the house of which I said,
        My name shall be there.

023:028 Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and all that he did, are
        they not written in the book of the chronicles of the kings of
        Judah?

023:029 In his days Pharaohnechoh king of Egypt went up against the
        king of Assyria to the river Euphrates: and king Josiah went
        against him; and he slew him at Megiddo, when he had seen him.

023:030 And his servants carried him in a chariot dead from Megiddo,
        and brought him to Jerusalem, and buried him in his own
        sepulchre. And the people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of
        Josiah, and anointed him, and made him king in his father's
        stead.

023:031 Jehoahaz was twenty and three years old when he began to
        reign; and he reigned three months in Jerusalem. And his
        mother's name was Hamutal, the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.

023:032 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD,
        according to all that his fathers had done.

023:033 And Pharaohnechoh put him in bands at Riblah in the land of
        Hamath, that he might not reign in Jerusalem; and put the land
        to a tribute of an hundred talents of silver, and a talent of
        gold.

023:034 And Pharaohnechoh made Eliakim the son of Josiah king in the
        room of Josiah his father, and turned his name to Jehoiakim,
        and took Jehoahaz away: and he came to Egypt, and died there.

023:035 And Jehoiakim gave the silver and the gold to Pharaoh; but he
        taxed the land to give the money according to the commandment
        of Pharaoh: he exacted the silver and the gold of the people
        of the land, of every one according to his taxation, to give
        it unto Pharaohnechoh.

023:036 Jehoiakim was twenty and five years old when he began to
        reign; and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. And his
        mother's name was Zebudah, the daughter of Pedaiah of Rumah.

023:037 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD,
        according to all that his fathers had done.

024:001 In his days Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up, and
        Jehoiakim became his servant three years: then he turned and
        rebelled against him.

024:002 And the LORD sent against him bands of the Chaldees, and bands
        of the Syrians, and bands of the Moabites, and bands of the
        children of Ammon, and sent them against Judah to destroy it,
        according to the word of the LORD, which he spake by his
        servants the prophets.

024:003 Surely at the commandment of the LORD came this upon Judah, to
        remove them out of his sight, for the sins of Manasseh,
        according to all that he did;

024:004 And also for the innocent blood that he shed: for he filled
        Jerusalem with innocent blood; which the LORD would not
        pardon.

024:005 Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim, and all that he did,
        are they not written in the book of the chronicles of the
        kings of Judah?

024:006 So Jehoiakim slept with his fathers: and Jehoiachin his son
        reigned in his stead.

024:007 And the king of Egypt came not again any more out of his land:
        for the king of Babylon had taken from the river of Egypt unto
        the river Euphrates all that pertained to the king of Egypt.

024:008 Jehoiachin was eighteen years old when he began to reign, and
        he reigned in Jerusalem three months. And his mother's name
        was Nehushta, the daughter of Elnathan of Jerusalem.

024:009 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD,
        according to all that his father had done.

024:010 At that time the servants of Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon
        came up against Jerusalem, and the city was besieged.

024:011 And Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came against the city, and
        his servants did besiege it.

024:012 And Jehoiachin the king of Judah went out to the king of
        Babylon, he, and his mother, and his servants, and his
        princes, and his officers: and the king of Babylon took him in
        the eighth year of his reign.

024:013 And he carried out thence all the treasures of the house of
        the LORD, and the treasures of the king's house, and cut in
        pieces all the vessels of gold which Solomon king of Israel
        had made in the temple of the LORD, as the LORD had said.

024:014 And he carried away all Jerusalem, and all the princes, and
        all the mighty men of valour, even ten thousand captives, and
        all the craftsmen and smiths: none remained, save the poorest
        sort of the people of the land.

024:015 And he carried away Jehoiachin to Babylon, and the king's
        mother, and the king's wives, and his officers, and the mighty
        of the land, those carried he into captivity from Jerusalem to
        Babylon.

024:016 And all the men of might, even seven thousand, and craftsmen
        and smiths a thousand, all that were strong and apt for war,
        even them the king of Babylon brought captive to Babylon.

024:017 And the king of Babylon made Mattaniah his father's brother
        king in his stead, and changed his name to Zedekiah.

024:018 Zedekiah was twenty and one years old when he began to reign,
        and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem. And his mother's
        name was Hamutal, the daughter of Jeremiah of Libnah.

024:019 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD,
        according to all that Jehoiakim had done.

024:020 For through the anger of the LORD it came to pass in Jerusalem
        and Judah, until he had cast them out from his presence, that
        Zedekiah rebelled against the king of Babylon.

025:001 And it came to pass in the ninth year of his reign, in the
        tenth month, in the tenth day of the month, that
        Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came, he, and all his host,
        against Jerusalem, and pitched against it; and they built
        forts against it round about.

025:002 And the city was besieged unto the eleventh year of king
        Zedekiah.

025:003 And on the ninth day of the fourth month the famine prevailed
        in the city, and there was no bread for the people of the
        land.

025:004 And the city was broken up, and all the men of war fled by
        night by the way of the gate between two walls, which is by
        the king's garden: (now the Chaldees were against the city
        round about:) and the king went the way toward the plain.

025:005 And the army of the Chaldees pursued after the king, and
        overtook him in the plains of Jericho: and all his army were
        scattered from him.

025:006 So they took the king, and brought him up to the king of
        Babylon to Riblah; and they gave judgment upon him.

025:007 And they slew the sons of Zedekiah before his eyes, and put
        out the eyes of Zedekiah, and bound him with fetters of brass,
        and carried him to Babylon.

025:008 And in the fifth month, on the seventh day of the month, which
        is the nineteenth year of king Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon,
        came Nebuzaradan, captain of the guard, a servant of the king
        of Babylon, unto Jerusalem:

025:009 And he burnt the house of the LORD, and the king's house, and
        all the houses of Jerusalem, and every great man's house burnt
        he with fire.

025:010 And all the army of the Chaldees, that were with the captain
        of the guard, brake down the walls of Jerusalem round about.

025:011 Now the rest of the people that were left in the city, and the
        fugitives that fell away to the king of Babylon, with the
        remnant of the multitude, did Nebuzaradan the captain of the
        guard carry away.

025:012 But the captain of the guard left of the door of the poor of
        the land to be vinedressers and husbandmen.

025:013 And the pillars of brass that were in the house of the LORD,
        and the bases, and the brasen sea that was in the house of the
        LORD, did the Chaldees break in pieces, and carried the brass
        of them to Babylon.

025:014 And the pots, and the shovels, and the snuffers, and the
        spoons, and all the vessels of brass wherewith they
        ministered, took they away.

025:015 And the firepans, and the bowls, and such things as were of
        gold, in gold, and of silver, in silver, the captain of the
        guard took away.

025:016 The two pillars, one sea, and the bases which Solomon had made
        for the house of the LORD; the brass of all these vessels was
        without weight.

025:017 The height of the one pillar was eighteen cubits, and the
        chapiter upon it was brass: and the height of the chapiter
        three cubits; and the wreathen work, and pomegranates upon the
        chapiter round about, all of brass: and like unto these had
        the second pillar with wreathen work.

025:018 And the captain of the guard took Seraiah the chief priest,
        and Zephaniah the second priest, and the three keepers of the
        door:

025:019 And out of the city he took an officer that was set over the
        men of war, and five men of them that were in the king's
        presence, which were found in the city, and the principal
        scribe of the host, which mustered the people of the land, and
        threescore men of the people of the land that were found in
        the city:

025:020 And Nebuzaradan captain of the guard took these, and brought
        them to the king of Babylon to Riblah:

025:021 And the king of Babylon smote them, and slew them at Riblah in
        the land of Hamath. So Judah was carried away out of their
        land.

025:022 And as for the people that remained in the land of Judah, whom
        Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon had left, even over them he
        made Gedaliah the son of Ahikam, the son of Shaphan, ruler.

025:023 And when all the captains of the armies, they and their men,
        heard that the king of Babylon had made Gedaliah governor,
        there came to Gedaliah to Mizpah, even Ishmael the son of
        Nethaniah, and Johanan the son of Careah, and Seraiah the son
        of Tanhumeth the Netophathite, and Jaazaniah the son of a
        Maachathite, they and their men.

025:024 And Gedaliah sware to them, and to their men, and said unto
        them, Fear not to be the servants of the Chaldees: dwell in
        the land, and serve the king of Babylon; and it shall be well
        with you.

025:025 But it came to pass in the seventh month, that Ishmael the son
        of Nethaniah, the son of Elishama, of the seed royal, came,
        and ten men with him, and smote Gedaliah, that he died, and
        the Jews and the Chaldees that were with him at Mizpah.

025:026 And all the people, both small and great, and the captains of
        the armies, arose, and came to Egypt: for they were afraid of
        the Chaldees.

025:027 And it came to pass in the seven and thirtieth year of the
        captivity of Jehoiachin king of Judah, in the twelfth month,
        on the seven and twentieth day of the month, that Evilmerodach
        king of Babylon in the year that he began to reign did lift up
        the head of Jehoiachin king of Judah out of prison;

025:028 And he spake kindly to him, and set his throne above the
        throne of the kings that were with him in Babylon;

025:029 And changed his prison garments: and he did eat bread
        continually before him all the days of his life.

025:030 And his allowance was a continual allowance given him of the
        king, a daily rate for every day, all the days of his life.

        born unto him of the daughter of Shua the Canaanitess. And Er,
        the firstborn of Judah, was evil in the sight of the LORD; and
        he slew him.

002:004 And Tamar his daughter in law bore him Pharez and Zerah. All

002:005 The sons of Pharez; Hezron, and Hamul.

        bare him Hur.

002:020 And Hur begat Uri, and Uri begat Bezaleel.

002:021 And afterward Hezron went in to the daughter of Machir the
        father of Gilead, whom he married when he was threescore years
        old; and she bare him Segub.

002:022 And Segub begat Jair, who had three and twenty cities in the
        land of Gilead.

002:023 And he took Geshur, and Aram, with the towns of Jair, from
        them, with Kenath, and the towns thereof, even threescore
        cities. All these belonged to the sons of Machir the father of
        Gilead.

002:024 And after that Hezron was dead in Calebephratah, then Abiah
        Hezron's wife bare him Ashur the father of Tekoa.

002:025 And the sons of Jerahmeel the firstborn of Hezron were, Ram
        the firstborn, and Bunah, and Oren, and Ozem, and Ahijah.

002:049 She bare also Shaaph the father of Madmannah, Sheva the father

        Ephratah; Shobal the father of Kirjathjearim.

003:001 Now these were the sons of David, which were born unto him in

        sorrow.

004:010 And Jabez called on the God of Israel, saying, Oh that thou
        wouldest bless me indeed, and enlarge my coast, and that thine
        hand might be with me, and that thou wouldest keep me from
        evil, that it may not grieve me! And God granted him that
        which he requested.

        Ashbea,

004:022 And Jokim, and the men of Chozeba, and Joash, and Saraph, who
        had the dominion in Moab, and Jashubilehem. And these are
        ancient things.

004:023 These were the potters, and those that dwelt among plants and
        hedges: there they dwelt with the king for his work.

004:024 The sons of Simeon were, Nemuel, and Jamin, Jarib, Zerah, and

004:026 And the sons of Mishma; Hamuel his son, Zacchur his son,
        Shimei his son.

004:027 And Shimei had sixteen sons and six daughters: but his
        brethren had not many children, neither did all their family
        multiply, like to the children of Judah.

004:028 And they dwelt at Beersheba, and Moladah, and Hazarshual,

004:029 And at Bilhah, and at Ezem, and at Tolad,

004:030 And at Bethuel, and at Hormah, and at Ziklag,

004:031 And at Bethmarcaboth, and Hazarsusim, and at Bethbirei, and at
        Shaaraim. These were their cities unto the reign of David.

004:032 And their villages were, Etam, and Ain, Rimmon, and Tochen,
        and Ashan, five cities:

004:033 And all their villages that were round about the same cities,
        unto Baal. These were their habitations, and their genealogy.

004:034 And Meshobab, and Jamlech, and Joshah, the son of Amaziah,

004:035 And Joel, and Jehu the son of Josibiah, the son of Seraiah,
        the son of Asiel,

004:037 And Ziza the son of Shiphi, the son of Allon, the son of
        Jedaiah, the son of Shimri, the son of Shemaiah;

004:038 These mentioned by their names were princes in their families:
        and the house of their fathers increased greatly.

004:039 And they went to the entrance of Gedor, even unto the east
        side of the valley, to seek pasture for their flocks.

004:040 And they found fat pasture and good, and the land was wide,
        and quiet, and peaceable; for they of Ham had dwelt there of
        old.

004:041 And these written by name came in the days of Hezekiah king of
        Judah, and smote their tents, and the habitations that were
        found there, and destroyed them utterly unto this day, and
        dwelt in their rooms: because there was pasture there for
        their flocks.

004:042 And some of them, even of the sons of Simeon, five hundred
        men, went to mount Seir, having for their captains Pelatiah,
        and Neariah, and Rephaiah, and Uzziel, the sons of Ishi.

004:043 And they smote the rest of the Amalekites that were escaped,
        and dwelt there unto this day.

005:001 Now the sons of Reuben the firstborn of Israel, (for he was
        the firstborn; but forasmuch as he defiled his father's bed,
        his birthright was given unto the sons of Joseph the son of
        Israel: and the genealogy is not to be reckoned after the
        birthright.

005:002 For Judah prevailed above his brethren, and of him came the
        chief ruler; but the birthright was Joseph's:)

005:003 The sons, I say, of Reuben the firstborn of Israel were,
        Hanoch, and Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi.

005:004 The sons of Joel; Shemaiah his son, Gog his son, Shimei his
        son,

005:005 Micah his son, Reaia his son, Baal his son,

005:006 Beerah his son, whom Tilgathpilneser king of Assyria carried
        away captive: he was prince of the Reubenites.

005:007 And his brethren by their families, when the genealogy of
        their generations was reckoned, were the chief, Jeiel, and
        Zechariah,

005:008 And Bela the son of Azaz, the son of Shema, the son of Joel,
        who dwelt in Aroer, even unto Nebo and Baalmeon:

005:009 And eastward he inhabited unto the entering in of the
        wilderness from the river Euphrates: because their cattle were
        multiplied in the land of Gilead.

005:010 And in the days of Saul they made war with the Hagarites, who
        fell by their hand: and they dwelt in their tents throughout
        all the east land of Gilead.

005:011 And the children of Gad dwelt over against them, in the land
        of Bashan unto Salcah:

005:012 Joel the chief, and Shapham the next, and Jaanai, and Shaphat
        in Bashan.

005:013 And their brethren of the house of their fathers were,
        Michael, and Meshullam, and Sheba, and Jorai, and Jachan, and
        Zia, and Heber, seven.

005:014 These are the children of Abihail the son of Huri, the son of
        Jaroah, the son of Gilead, the son of Michael, the son of
        Jeshishai, the son of Jahdo, the son of Buz;

005:015 Ahi the son of Abdiel, the son of Guni, chief of the house of
        their fathers.

005:016 And they dwelt in Gilead in Bashan, and in her towns, and in
        all the suburbs of Sharon, upon their borders.

005:017 All these were reckoned by genealogies in the days of Jotham
        king of Judah, and in the days of Jeroboam king of Israel.

005:018 The sons of Reuben, and the Gadites, and half the tribe of
        Manasseh, of valiant men, men able to bear buckler and sword,
        and to shoot with bow, and skilful in war, were four and forty
        thousand seven hundred and threescore, that went out to the
        war.

005:019 And they made war with the Hagarites, with Jetur, and Nephish,
        and Nodab.

005:020 And they were helped against them, and the Hagarites were
        delivered into their hand, and all that were with them: for
        they cried to God in the battle, and he was intreated of them;
        because they put their trust in him.

005:021 And they took away their cattle; of their camels fifty
        thousand, and of sheep two hundred and fifty thousand, and of
        asses two thousand, and of men an hundred thousand.

005:022 For there fell down many slain, because the war was of God.
        And they dwelt in their steads until the captivity.

005:023 And the children of the half tribe of Manasseh dwelt in the
        land: they increased from Bashan unto Baalhermon and Senir,
        and unto mount Hermon.

005:024 And these were the heads of the house of their fathers, even
        Epher, and Ishi, and Eliel, and Azriel, and Jeremiah, and
        Hodaviah, and Jahdiel, mighty men of valour, famous men, and
        heads of the house of their fathers.

005:025 And they transgressed against the God of their fathers, and
        went a whoring after the gods of the people of the land, whom
        God destroyed before them.

005:026 And the God of Israel stirred up the spirit of Pul king of
        Assyria, and the spirit of Tilgathpilneser king of Assyria,
        and he carried them away, even the Reubenites, and the
        Gadites, and the half tribe of Manasseh, and brought them unto
        Halah, and Habor, and Hara, and to the river Gozan, unto this
        day.

006:001 The sons of Levi; Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.

006:002 And the sons of Kohath; Amram, Izhar, and Hebron, and Uzziel.

006:003 And the children of Amram; Aaron, and Moses, and Miriam. The
        sons also of Aaron; Nadab, and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.

006:008 And Ahitub begat Zadok, and Zadok begat Ahimaaz,

006:009 And Ahimaaz begat Azariah, and Azariah begat Johanan,

006:010 And Johanan begat Azariah, (he it is that executed the
        priest's office in the temple that Solomon built in
        Jerusalem:)

006:011 And Azariah begat Amariah, and Amariah begat Ahitub,

006:012 And Ahitub begat Zadok, and Zadok begat Shallum,

006:013 And Shallum begat Hilkiah, and Hilkiah begat Azariah,

006:014 And Azariah begat Seraiah, and Seraiah begat Jehozadak,

006:015 And Jehozadak went into captivity, when the LORD carried away
        Judah and Jerusalem by the hand of Nebuchadnezzar.

006:016 The sons of Levi; Gershom, Kohath, and Merari.

006:017 And these be the names of the sons of Gershom; Libni, and
        Shimei.

006:018 And the sons of Kohath were, Amram, and Izhar, and Hebron, and
        Uzziel.

009:001 So all Israel were reckoned by genealogies; and, behold, they
        were written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah, who
        were carried away to Babylon for their transgression.

009:002 Now the first inhabitants that dwelt in their possessions in
        their cities were, the Israelites, the priests, Levites, and
        the Nethinims.

009:003 And in Jerusalem dwelt of the children of Judah, and of the

        fathers in the house of their fathers.

009:010 And of the priests; Jedaiah, and Jehoiarib, and Jachin,

        Immer;

009:013 And their brethren, heads of the house of their fathers, a
        thousand and seven hundred and threescore; very able men for
        the work of the service of the house of God.

009:014 And of the Levites; Shemaiah the son of Hasshub, the son of
        Azrikam, the son of Hashabiah, of the sons of Merari;

009:015 And Bakbakkar, Heresh, and Galal, and Mattaniah the son of
        Micah, the son of Zichri, the son of Asaph;

009:016 And Obadiah the son of Shemaiah, the son of Galal, the son of
        Jeduthun, and Berechiah the son of Asa, the son of Elkanah,
        that dwelt in the villages of the Netophathites.

009:017 And the porters were, Shallum, and Akkub, and Talmon, and
        Ahiman, and their brethren: Shallum was the chief;

009:018 Who hitherto waited in the king's gate eastward: they were
        porters in the companies of the children of Levi.

009:019 And Shallum the son of Kore, the son of Ebiasaph, the son of
        Korah, and his brethren, of the house of his father, the
        Korahites, were over the work of the service, keepers of the
        gates of the tabernacle: and their fathers, being over the
        host of the LORD, were keepers of the entry.

009:020 And Phinehas the son of Eleazar was the ruler over them in
        time past, and the LORD was with him.

009:021 And Zechariah the son of Meshelemiah was porter of the door of
        the tabernacle of the congregation.

009:022 All these which were chosen to be porters in the gates were
        two hundred and twelve. These were reckoned by their genealogy
        in their villages, whom David and Samuel the seer did ordain
        in their set office.

009:023 So they and their children had the oversight of the gates of
        the house of the LORD, namely, the house of the tabernacle, by
        wards.

009:024 In four quarters were the porters, toward the east, west,
        north, and south.

009:025 And their brethren, which were in their villages, were to come
        after seven days from time to time with them.

009:026 For these Levites, the four chief porters, were in their set
        office, and were over the chambers and treasuries of the house
        of God.

009:027 And they lodged round about the house of God, because the
        charge was upon them, and the opening thereof every morning
        pertained to them.

009:028 And certain of them had the charge of the ministering vessels,
        that they should bring them in and out by tale.

009:029 Some of them also were appointed to oversee the vessels, and
        all the instruments of the sanctuary, and the fine flour, and
        the wine, and the oil, and the frankincense, and the spices.

009:030 And some of the sons of the priests made the ointment of the
        spices.

009:031 And Mattithiah, one of the Levites, who was the firstborn of
        Shallum the Korahite, had the set office over the things that
        were made in the pans.

009:032 And other of their brethren, of the sons of the Kohathites,
        were over the shewbread, to prepare it every sabbath.

009:033 And these are the singers, chief of the fathers of the
        Levites, who remaining in the chambers were free: for they
        were employed in that work day and night.

009:034 These chief fathers of the Levites were chief throughout their
        generations; these dwelt at Jerusalem.

009:035 And in Gibeon dwelt the father of Gibeon, Jehiel, whose wife's
        name was Maachah:

009:036 And his firstborn son Abdon, then Zur, and Kish, and Baal, and
        Ner, and Nadab.

009:037 And Gedor, and Ahio, and Zechariah, and Mikloth.

009:038 And Mikloth begat Shimeam. And they also dwelt with their
        brethren at Jerusalem, over against their brethren.

009:039 And Ner begat Kish; and Kish begat Saul; and Saul begat
        Jonathan, and Malchishua, and Abinadab, and Eshbaal.

009:040 And the son of Jonathan was Meribbaal: and Meribbaal begat
        Micah.

009:041 And the sons of Micah were, Pithon, and Melech, and Tahrea,
        and Ahaz.

009:042 And Ahaz begat Jarah; and Jarah begat Alemeth, and Azmaveth,
        and Zimri; and Zimri begat Moza;

009:043 And Moza begat Binea; and Rephaiah his son, Eleasah his son,
        Azel his son.

009:044 And Azel had six sons, whose names are these, Azrikam,
        Bocheru, and Ishmael, and Sheariah, and Obadiah, and Hanan:
        these were the sons of Azel.

010:001 Now the Philistines fought against Israel; and the men of
        Israel fled from before the Philistines, and fell down slain
        in mount Gilboa.

010:002 And the Philistines followed hard after Saul, and after his
        sons; and the Philistines slew Jonathan, and Abinadab, and
        Malchishua, the sons of Saul.

010:003 And the battle went sore against Saul, and the archers hit
        him, and he was wounded of the archers.

010:004 Then said Saul to his armourbearer, Draw thy sword, and thrust
        me through therewith; lest these uncircumcised come and abuse
        me. But his armourbearer would not; for he was sore afraid. So
        Saul took a sword, and fell upon it.

010:005 And when his armourbearer saw that Saul was dead, he fell
        likewise on the sword, and died.

010:006 So Saul died, and his three sons, and all his house died
        together.

010:007 And when all the men of Israel that were in the valley saw
        that they fled, and that Saul and his sons were dead, then
        they forsook their cities, and fled: and the Philistines came
        and dwelt in them.

010:008 And it came to pass on the morrow, when the Philistines came
        to strip the slain, that they found Saul and his sons fallen
        in mount Gilboa.

010:009 And when they had stripped him, they took his head, and his
        armour, and sent into the land of the Philistines round about,
        to carry tidings unto their idols, and to the people.

010:010 And they put his armour in the house of their gods, and
        fastened his head in the temple of Dagon.

010:011 And when all Jabeshgilead heard all that the Philistines had
        done to Saul,

010:012 They arose, all the valiant men, and took away the body of
        Saul, and the bodies of his sons, and brought them to Jabesh,
        and buried their bones under the oak in Jabesh, and fasted
        seven days.

010:013 So Saul died for his transgression which he committed against
        the LORD, even against the word of the LORD, which he kept
        not, and also for asking counsel of one that had a familiar
        spirit, to enquire of it;

010:014 And enquired not of the LORD: therefore he slew him, and
        turned the kingdom unto David the son of Jesse.

011:001 Then all Israel gathered themselves to David unto Hebron,
        saying, Behold, we are thy bone and thy flesh.

011:002 And moreover in time past, even when Saul was king, thou wast
        he that leddest out and broughtest in Israel: and the LORD thy
        God said unto thee, Thou shalt feed my people Israel, and thou
        shalt be ruler over my people Israel.

011:003 Therefore came all the elders of Israel to the king to Hebron;
        and David made a covenant with them in Hebron before the LORD;
        and they anointed David king over Israel, according to the
        word of the LORD by Samuel.

011:004 And David and all Israel went to Jerusalem, which is Jebus;
        where the Jebusites were, the inhabitants of the land.

011:005 And the inhabitants of Jebus said to David, Thou shalt not
        come hither. Nevertheless David took the castle of Zion, which
        is the city of David.

011:006 And David said, Whosoever smiteth the Jebusites first shall be
        chief and captain. So Joab the son of Zeruiah went first up,
        and was chief.

011:007 And David dwelt in the castle; therefore they called it the
        city of David.

011:008 And he built the city round about, even from Millo round
        about: and Joab repaired the rest of the city.

011:009 So David waxed greater and greater: for the LORD of hosts was
        with him.

011:010 These also are the chief of the mighty men whom David had, who
        strengthened themselves with him in his kingdom, and with all
        Israel, to make him king, according to the word of the LORD
        concerning Israel.

011:011 And this is the number of the mighty men whom David had;
        Jashobeam, an Hachmonite, the chief of the captains: he lifted
        up his spear against three hundred slain by him at one time.

011:012 And after him was Eleazar the son of Dodo, the Ahohite, who
        was one of the three mighties.

011:013 He was with David at Pasdammim, and there the Philistines were
        gathered together to battle, where was a parcel of ground full
        of barley; and the people fled from before the Philistines.

011:014 And they set themselves in the midst of that parcel, and
        delivered it, and slew the Philistines; and the LORD saved
        them by a great deliverance.

011:015 Now three of the thirty captains went down to the rock to
        David, into the cave of Adullam; and the host of the
        Philistines encamped in the valley of Rephaim.

011:016 And David was then in the hold, and the Philistines' garrison
        was then at Bethlehem.

011:017 And David longed, and said, Oh that one would give me drink of
        the water of the well of Bethlehem, that is at the gate!

011:018 And the three brake through the host of the Philistines, and
        drew water out of the well of Bethlehem, that was by the gate,
        and took it, and brought it to David: but David would not
        drink of it, but poured it out to the LORD.

011:019 And said, My God forbid it me, that I should do this thing:
        shall I drink the blood of these men that have put their lives
        in jeopardy? for with the jeopardy of their lives they brought
        it. Therefore he would not drink it. These things did these
        three mightiest.

011:020 And Abishai the brother of Joab, he was chief of the three:
        for lifting up his spear against three hundred, he slew them,
        and had a name among the three.

011:021 Of the three, he was more honourable than the two; for he was
        their captain: howbeit he attained not to the first three.

011:022 Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man of
        Kabzeel, who had done many acts; he slew two lionlike men of
        Moab: also he went down and slew a lion in a pit in a snowy
        day.

011:023 And he slew an Egyptian, a man of great stature, five cubits
        high; and in the Egyptian's hand was a spear like a weaver's
        beam; and he went down to him with a staff, and plucked the
        spear out of the Egyptian's hand, and slew him with his own
        spear.

011:024 These things did Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and had the name
        among the three mighties.

011:025 Behold, he was honourable among the thirty, but attained not
        to the first three: and David set him over his guard.

011:026 Also the valiant men of the armies were, Asahel the brother of
        Joab, Elhanan the son of Dodo of Bethlehem,

011:027 Shammoth the Harorite, Helez the Pelonite,

011:028 Ira the son of Ikkesh the Tekoite, Abiezer the Antothite,

011:029 Sibbecai the Hushathite, Ilai the Ahohite,

011:030 Maharai the Netophathite, Heled the son of Baanah the
        Netophathite,

011:031 Ithai the son of Ribai of Gibeah, that pertained to the
        children of Benjamin, Benaiah the Pirathonite,

011:032 Hurai of the brooks of Gaash, Abiel the Arbathite,

011:033 Azmaveth the Baharumite, Eliahba the Shaalbonite,

011:034 The sons of Hashem the Gizonite, Jonathan the son of Shage the
        Hararite,

011:035 Ahiam the son of Sacar the Hararite, Eliphal the son of Ur,

011:036 Hepher the Mecherathite, Ahijah the Pelonite,

011:037 Hezro the Carmelite, Naarai the son of Ezbai,

011:038 Joel the brother of Nathan, Mibhar the son of Haggeri,

011:039 Zelek the Ammonite, Naharai the Berothite, the armourbearer of
        Joab the son of Zeruiah,

011:040 Ira the Ithrite, Gareb the Ithrite,

011:041 Uriah the Hittite, Zabad the son of Ahlai,

011:042 Adina the son of Shiza the Reubenite, a captain of the
        Reubenites, and thirty with him,

011:043 Hanan the son of Maachah, and Joshaphat the Mithnite,

011:044 Uzzia the Ashterathite, Shama and Jehiel the sons of Hothan
        the Aroerite,

011:045 Jediael the son of Shimri, and Joha his brother, the Tizite,

011:046 Eliel the Mahavite, and Jeribai, and Joshaviah, the sons of
        Elnaam, and Ithmah the Moabite,

011:047 Eliel, and Obed, and Jasiel the Mesobaite.

012:001 Now these are they that came to David to Ziklag, while he yet
        kept himself close because of Saul the son of Kish: and they
        were among the mighty men, helpers of the war.

012:002 They were armed with bows, and could use both the right hand
        and the left in hurling stones and shooting arrows out of a
        bow, even of Saul's brethren of Benjamin.

012:003 The chief was Ahiezer, then Joash, the sons of Shemaah the
        Gibeathite; and Jeziel, and Pelet, the sons of Azmaveth; and
        Berachah, and Jehu the Antothite.

012:004 And Ismaiah the Gibeonite, a mighty man among the thirty, and
        over the thirty; and Jeremiah, and Jahaziel, and Johanan, and
        Josabad the Gederathite,

012:005 Eluzai, and Jerimoth, and Bealiah, and Shemariah, and
        Shephatiah the Haruphite,

012:006 Elkanah, and Jesiah, and Azareel, and Joezer, and Jashobeam,
        the Korhites,

012:007 And Joelah, and Zebadiah, the sons of Jeroham of Gedor.

012:008 And of the Gadites there separated themselves unto David into
        the hold to the wilderness men of might, and men of war fit
        for the battle, that could handle shield and buckler, whose
        faces were like the faces of lions, and were as swift as the
        roes upon the mountains;

012:009 Ezer the first, Obadiah the second, Eliab the third,

012:010 Mishmannah the fourth, Jeremiah the fifth,

012:011 Attai the sixth, Eliel the seventh,

012:012 Johanan the eighth, Elzabad the ninth,

012:013 Jeremiah the tenth, Machbanai the eleventh.

012:014 These were of the sons of Gad, captains of the host: one of
        the least was over an hundred, and the greatest over a
        thousand.

012:015 These are they that went over Jordan in the first month, when
        it had overflown all his banks; and they put to flight all
        them of the valleys, both toward the east, and toward the
        west.

012:016 And there came of the children of Benjamin and Judah to the
        hold unto David.

012:017 And David went out to meet them, and answered and said unto
        them, If ye be come peaceably unto me to help me, mine heart
        shall be knit unto you: but if ye be come to betray me to mine
        enemies, seeing there is no wrong in mine hands, the God of
        our fathers look thereon, and rebuke it.

012:018 Then the spirit came upon Amasai, who was chief of the
        captains, and he said, Thine are we, David, and on thy side,
        thou son of Jesse: peace, peace be unto thee, and peace be to
        thine helpers; for thy God helpeth thee. Then David received
        them, and made them captains of the band.

012:019 And there fell some of Manasseh to David, when he came with
        the Philistines against Saul to battle: but they helped them
        not: for the lords of the Philistines upon advisement sent him
        away, saying, He will fall to his master Saul to the jeopardy
        of our heads.

012:020 As he went to Ziklag, there fell to him of Manasseh, Adnah,
        and Jozabad, and Jediael, and Michael, and Jozabad, and Elihu,
        and Zilthai, captains of the thousands that were of Manasseh.

012:021 And they helped David against the band of the rovers: for they
        were all mighty men of valour, and were captains in the host.

012:022 For at that time day by day there came to David to help him,
        until it was a great host, like the host of God.

012:023 And these are the numbers of the bands that were ready armed
        to the war, and came to David to Hebron, to turn the kingdom
        of Saul to him, according to the word of the LORD.

012:024 The children of Judah that bare shield and spear were six
        thousand and eight hundred, ready armed to the war.

012:025 Of the children of Simeon, mighty men of valour for the war,
        seven thousand and one hundred.

012:026 Of the children of Levi four thousand and six hundred.

012:027 And Jehoiada was the leader of the Aaronites, and with him
        were three thousand and seven hundred;

012:028 And Zadok, a young man mighty of valour, and of his father's
        house twenty and two captains.

012:029 And of the children of Benjamin, the kindred of Saul, three
        thousand: for hitherto the greatest part of them had kept the
        ward of the house of Saul.

012:030 And of the children of Ephraim twenty thousand and eight
        hundred, mighty men of valour, famous throughout the house of
        their fathers.

012:031 And of the half tribe of Manasseh eighteen thousand, which
        were expressed by name, to come and make David king.

012:032 And of the children of Issachar, which were men that had
        understanding of the times, to know what Israel ought to do;
        the heads of them were two hundred; and all their brethren
        were at their commandment.

012:033 Of Zebulun, such as went forth to battle, expert in war, with
        all instruments of war, fifty thousand, which could keep rank:
        they were not of double heart.

012:034 And of Naphtali a thousand captains, and with them with shield
        and spear thirty and seven thousand.

012:035 And of the Danites expert in war twenty and eight thousand and
        six hundred.

012:036 And of Asher, such as went forth to battle, expert in war,
        forty thousand.

012:037 And on the other side of Jordan, of the Reubenites, and the
        Gadites, and of the half tribe of Manasseh, with all manner of
        instruments of war for the battle, an hundred and twenty
        thousand.

012:038 All these men of war, that could keep rank, came with a
        perfect heart to Hebron, to make David king over all Israel:
        and all the rest also of Israel were of one heart to make
        David king.

012:039 And there they were with David three days, eating and
        drinking: for their brethren had prepared for them.

012:040 Moreover they that were nigh them, even unto Issachar and
        Zebulun and Naphtali, brought bread on asses, and on camels,
        and on mules, and on oxen, and meat, meal, cakes of figs, and
        bunches of raisins, and wine, and oil, and oxen, and sheep
        abundantly: for there was joy in Israel.

013:001 And David consulted with the captains of thousands and
        hundreds, and with every leader.

013:002 And David said unto all the congregation of Israel, If it seem
        good unto you, and that it be of the LORD our God, let us send
        abroad unto our brethren every where, that are left in all the
        land of Israel, and with them also to the priests and Levites
        which are in their cities and suburbs, that they may gather
        themselves unto us:

013:003 And let us bring again the ark of our God to us: for we
        enquired not at it in the days of Saul.

013:004 And all the congregation said that they would do so: for the
        thing was right in the eyes of all the people.

013:005 So David gathered all Israel together, from Shihor of Egypt
        even unto the entering of Hemath, to bring the ark of God from
        Kirjathjearim.

013:006 And David went up, and all Israel, to Baalah, that is, to
        Kirjathjearim, which belonged to Judah, to bring up thence the
        ark of God the LORD, that dwelleth between the cherubims,
        whose name is called on it.

013:007 And they carried the ark of God in a new cart out of the house
        of Abinadab: and Uzza and Ahio drave the cart.

013:008 And David and all Israel played before God with all their
        might, and with singing, and with harps, and with psalteries,
        and with timbrels, and with cymbals, and with trumpets.

013:009 And when they came unto the threshingfloor of Chidon, Uzza put
        forth his hand to hold the ark; for the oxen stumbled.

013:010 And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Uzza, and he
        smote him, because he put his hand to the ark: and there he
        died before God.

013:011 And David was displeased, because the LORD had made a breach
        upon Uzza: wherefore that place is called Perezuzza to this
        day.

013:012 And David was afraid of God that day, saying, How shall I
        bring the ark of God home to me?

013:013 So David brought not the ark home to himself to the city of
        David, but carried it aside into the house of Obededom the
        Gittite.

013:014 And the ark of God remained with the family of Obededom in his
        house three months. And the LORD blessed the house of
        Obededom, and all that he had.

014:001 Now Hiram king of Tyre sent messengers to David, and timber of
        cedars, with masons and carpenters, to build him an house.

014:002 And David perceived that the LORD had confirmed him king over
        Israel, for his kingdom was lifted up on high, because of his
        people Israel.

014:003 And David took more wives at Jerusalem: and David begat more
        sons and daughters.

014:004 Now these are the names of his children which he had in
        Jerusalem; Shammua, and Shobab, Nathan, and Solomon,

014:005 And Ibhar, and Elishua, and Elpalet,

014:006 And Nogah, and Nepheg, and Japhia,

014:007 And Elishama, and Beeliada, and Eliphalet.

014:008 And when the Philistines heard that David was anointed king
        over all Israel, all the Philistines went up to seek David.
        And David heard of it, and went out against them.

014:009 And the Philistines came and spread themselves in the valley
        of Rephaim.

014:010 And David enquired of God, saying, Shall I go up against the
        Philistines? And wilt thou deliver them into mine hand? And
        the LORD said unto him, Go up; for I will deliver them into
        thine hand.

014:011 So they came up to Baalperazim; and David smote them there.
        Then David said, God hath broken in upon mine enemies by mine
        hand like the breaking forth of waters: therefore they called
        the name of that place Baalperazim.

014:012 And when they had left their gods there, David gave a
        commandment, and they were burned with fire.

014:013 And the Philistines yet again spread themselves abroad in the
        valley.

014:014 Therefore David enquired again of God; and God said unto him,
        Go not up after them; turn away from them, and come upon them
        over against the mulberry trees.

014:015 And it shall be, when thou shalt hear a sound of going in the
        tops of the mulberry trees, that then thou shalt go out to
        battle: for God is gone forth before thee to smite the host of
        the Philistines.

014:016 David therefore did as God commanded him: and they smote the
        host of the Philistines from Gibeon even to Gazer.

014:017 And the fame of David went out into all lands; and the LORD
        brought the fear of him upon all nations.

015:001 And David made him houses in the city of David, and prepared a
        place for the ark of God, and pitched for it a tent.

015:002 Then David said, None ought to carry the ark of God but the
        Levites: for them hath the LORD chosen to carry the ark of
        God, and to minister unto him for ever.

015:003 And David gathered all Israel together to Jerusalem, to bring
        up the ark of the LORD unto his place, which he had prepared
        for it.

015:004 And David assembled the children of Aaron, and the Levites:

015:005 Of the sons of Kohath; Uriel the chief, and his brethren an
        hundred and twenty:

015:006 Of the sons of Merari; Asaiah the chief, and his brethren two
        hundred and twenty:

015:007 Of the sons of Gershom; Joel the chief and his brethren an
        hundred and thirty:

015:008 Of the sons of Elizaphan; Shemaiah the chief, and his brethren
        two hundred:

015:009 Of the sons of Hebron; Eliel the chief, and his brethren
        fourscore:

015:010 Of the sons of Uzziel; Amminadab the chief, and his brethren
        an hundred and twelve.

015:011 And David called for Zadok and Abiathar the priests, and for
        the Levites, for Uriel, Asaiah, and Joel, Shemaiah, and Eliel,
        and Amminadab,

015:012 And said unto them, Ye are the chief of the fathers of the
        Levites: sanctify yourselves, both ye and your brethren, that
        ye may bring up the ark of the LORD God of Israel unto the
        place that I have prepared for it.

015:013 For because ye did it not at the first, the LORD our God made
        a breach upon us, for that we sought him not after the due
        order.

015:014 So the priests and the Levites sanctified themselves to bring
        up the ark of the LORD God of Israel.

015:015 And the children of the Levites bare the ark of God upon their
        shoulders with the staves thereon, as Moses commanded
        according to the word of the LORD.

015:016 And David spake to the chief of the Levites to appoint their
        brethren to be the singers with instruments of musick,
        psalteries and harps and cymbals, sounding, by lifting up the
        voice with joy.

015:017 So the Levites appointed Heman the son of Joel; and of his
        brethren, Asaph the son of Berechiah; and of the sons of
        Merari their brethren, Ethan the son of Kushaiah;

015:018 And with them their brethren of the second degree, Zechariah,
        Ben, and Jaaziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Unni,
        Eliab, and Benaiah, and Maaseiah, and Mattithiah, and
        Elipheleh, and Mikneiah, and Obededom, and Jeiel, the porters.

015:019 So the singers, Heman, Asaph, and Ethan, were appointed to
        sound with cymbals of brass;

015:020 And Zechariah, and Aziel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and
        Unni, and Eliab, and Maaseiah, and Benaiah, with psalteries on
        Alamoth;

015:021 And Mattithiah, and Elipheleh, and Mikneiah, and Obededom, and
        Jeiel, and Azaziah, with harps on the Sheminith to excel.

015:022 And Chenaniah, chief of the Levites, was for song: he
        instructed about the song, because he was skilful.

015:023 And Berechiah and Elkanah were doorkeepers for the ark.

015:024 And Shebaniah, and Jehoshaphat, and Nethaneel, and Amasai, and
        Zechariah, and Benaiah, and Eliezer, the priests, did blow
        with the trumpets before the ark of God: and Obededom and
        Jehiah were doorkeepers for the ark.

015:025 So David, and the elders of Israel, and the captains over
        thousands, went to bring up the ark of the covenant of the
        LORD out of the house of Obededom with joy.

015:026 And it came to pass, when God helped the Levites that bare the
        ark of the covenant of the LORD, that they offered seven
        bullocks and seven rams.

015:027 And David was clothed with a robe of fine linen, and all the
        Levites that bare the ark, and the singers, and Chenaniah the
        master of the song with the singers: David also had upon him
        an ephod of linen.

015:028 Thus all Israel brought up the ark of the covenant of the LORD
        with shouting, and with sound of the cornet, and with
        trumpets, and with cymbals, making a noise with psalteries and
        harps.

015:029 And it came to pass, as the ark of the covenant of the LORD
        came to the city of David, that Michal, the daughter of Saul
        looking out at a window saw king David dancing and playing:
        and she despised him in her heart.

016:001 So they brought the ark of God, and set it in the midst of the
        tent that David had pitched for it: and they offered burnt
        sacrifices and peace offerings before God.

016:002 And when David had made an end of offering the burnt offerings
        and the peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of
        the LORD.

016:003 And he dealt to every one of Israel, both man and woman, to
        every one a loaf of bread, and a good piece of flesh, and a
        flagon of wine.

016:004 And he appointed certain of the Levites to minister before the
        ark of the LORD, and to record, and to thank and praise the
        LORD God of Israel:

016:005 Asaph the chief, and next to him Zechariah, Jeiel, and
        Shemiramoth, and Jehiel, and Mattithiah, and Eliab, and
        Benaiah, and Obededom: and Jeiel with psalteries and with
        harps; but Asaph made a sound with cymbals;

016:006 Benaiah also and Jahaziel the priests with trumpets
        continually before the ark of the covenant of God.

016:007 Then on that day David delivered first this psalm to thank the
        LORD into the hand of Asaph and his brethren.

016:008 Give thanks unto the LORD, call upon his name, make known his
        deeds among the people.

016:009 Sing unto him, sing psalms unto him, talk ye of all his
        wondrous works.

016:010 Glory ye in his holy name: let the heart of them rejoice that
        seek the LORD.

016:011 Seek the LORD and his strength, seek his face continually.

016:012 Remember his marvellous works that he hath done, his wonders,
        and the judgments of his mouth;

016:013 O ye seed of Israel his servant, ye children of Jacob, his
        chosen ones.

016:014 He is the LORD our God; his judgments are in all the earth.

016:015 Be ye mindful always of his covenant; the word which he
        commanded to a thousand generations;

016:016 Even of the covenant which he made with Abraham, and of his
        oath unto Isaac;

016:017 And hath confirmed the same to Jacob for a law, and to Israel
        for an everlasting covenant,

016:018 Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, the lot of
        your inheritance;

016:019 When ye were but few, even a few, and strangers in it.

016:020 And when they went from nation to nation, and from one kingdom
        to another people;

016:021 He suffered no man to do them wrong: yea, he reproved kings
        for their sakes,

016:022 Saying, Touch not mine anointed, and do my prophets no harm.

016:023 Sing unto the LORD, all the earth; shew forth from day to day
        his salvation.

016:024 Declare his glory among the heathen; his marvellous works
        among all nations.

016:025 For great is the LORD, and greatly to be praised: he also is
        to be feared above all gods.

016:026 For all the gods of the people are idols: but the LORD made
        the heavens.

016:027 Glory and honour are in his presence; strength and gladness
        are in his place.

016:028 Give unto the LORD, ye kindreds of the people, give unto the
        LORD glory and strength.

016:029 Give unto the LORD the glory due unto his name: bring an
        offering, and come before him: worship the LORD in the beauty
        of holiness.

016:030 Fear before him, all the earth: the world also shall be
        stable, that it be not moved.

016:031 Let the heavens be glad, and let the earth rejoice: and let
        men say among the nations, The LORD reigneth.

016:032 Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof: let the fields
        rejoice, and all that is therein.

016:033 Then shall the trees of the wood sing out at the presence of
        the LORD, because he cometh to judge the earth.

016:034 O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is good; for his mercy
        endureth for ever.

016:035 And say ye, Save us, O God of our salvation, and gather us
        together, and deliver us from the heathen, that we may give
        thanks to thy holy name, and glory in thy praise.

016:036 Blessed be the LORD God of Israel for ever and ever. And all
        the people said, Amen, and praised the LORD.

016:037 So he left there before the ark of the covenant of the LORD
        Asaph and his brethren, to minister before the ark
        continually, as every day's work required:

016:038 And Obededom with their brethren, threescore and eight;
        Obededom also the son of Jeduthun and Hosah to be porters:

016:039 And Zadok the priest, and his brethren the priests, before the
        tabernacle of the LORD in the high place that was at Gibeon,

016:040 To offer burnt offerings unto the LORD upon the altar of the
        burnt offering continually morning and evening, and to do
        according to all that is written in the law of the LORD, which
        he commanded Israel;

016:041 And with them Heman and Jeduthun, and the rest that were
        chosen, who were expressed by name, to give thanks to the
        LORD, because his mercy endureth for ever;

016:042 And with them Heman and Jeduthun with trumpets and cymbals for
        those that should make a sound, and with musical instruments
        of God. And the sons of Jeduthun were porters.

016:043 And all the people departed every man to his house: and David
        returned to bless his house.

017:001 Now it came to pass, as David sat in his house, that David
        said to Nathan the prophet, Lo, I dwell in an house of cedars,
        but the ark of the covenant of the LORD remaineth under
        curtains.

017:002 Then Nathan said unto David, Do all that is in thine heart;
        for God is with thee.

017:003 And it came to pass the same night, that the word of God came
        to Nathan, saying,

017:004 Go and tell David my servant, Thus saith the LORD, Thou shalt
        not build me an house to dwell in:

017:005 For I have not dwelt in an house since the day that I brought
        up Israel unto this day; but have gone from tent to tent, and
        from one tabernacle to another.

017:006 Wheresoever I have walked with all Israel, spake I a word to
        any of the judges of Israel, whom I commanded to feed my
        people, saying, Why have ye not built me an house of cedars?

017:007 Now therefore thus shalt thou say unto my servant David, Thus
        saith the LORD of hosts, I took thee from the sheepcote, even
        from following the sheep, that thou shouldest be ruler over my
        people Israel:

017:008 And I have been with thee whithersoever thou hast walked, and
        have cut off all thine enemies from before thee, and have made
        thee a name like the name of the great men that are in the
        earth.

017:009 Also I will ordain a place for my people Israel, and will
        plant them, and they shall dwell in their place, and shall be
        moved no more; neither shall the children of wickedness waste
        them any more, as at the beginning,

017:010 And since the time that I commanded judges to be over my
        people Israel. Moreover I will subdue all thine enemies.
        Furthermore I tell thee that the LORD will build thee an
        house.

017:011 And it shall come to pass, when thy days be expired that thou
        must go to be with thy fathers, that I will raise up thy seed
        after thee, which shall be of thy sons; and I will establish
        his kingdom.

017:012 He shall build me an house, and I will stablish his throne for
        ever.

017:013 I will be his father, and he shall be my son: and I will not
        take my mercy away from him, as I took it from him that was
        before thee:

017:014 But I will settle him in mine house and in my kingdom for
        ever: and his throne shall be established for evermore.

017:015 According to all these words, and according to all this
        vision, so did Nathan speak unto David.

017:016 And David the king came and sat before the LORD, and said, Who
        am I, O LORD God, and what is mine house, that thou hast
        brought me hitherto?

017:017 And yet this was a small thing in thine eyes, O God; for thou
        hast also spoken of thy servant's house for a great while to
        come, and hast regarded me according to the estate of a man of
        high degree, O LORD God.

017:018 What can David speak more to thee for the honour of thy
        servant? for thou knowest thy servant.

017:019 O LORD, for thy servant's sake, and according to thine own
        heart, hast thou done all this greatness, in making known all
        these great things.

017:020 O LORD, there is none like thee, neither is there any God
        beside thee, according to all that we have heard with our
        ears.

017:021 And what one nation in the earth is like thy people Israel,
        whom God went to redeem to be his own people, to make thee a
        name of greatness and terribleness, by driving out nations
        from before thy people whom thou hast redeemed out of Egypt?

017:022 For thy people Israel didst thou make thine own people for
        ever; and thou, LORD, becamest their God.

017:023 Therefore now, LORD, let the thing that thou hast spoken
        concerning thy servant and concerning his house be established
        for ever, and do as thou hast said.

017:024 Let it even be established, that thy name may be magnified for
        ever, saying, The LORD of hosts is the God of Israel, even a
        God to Israel: and let the house of David thy servant be
        established before thee.

017:025 For thou, O my God, hast told thy servant that thou wilt build
        him an house: therefore thy servant hath found in his heart to
        pray before thee.

017:026 And now, LORD, thou art God, and hast promised this goodness
        unto thy servant:

017:027 Now therefore let it please thee to bless the house of thy
        servant, that it may be before thee for ever: for thou
        blessest, O LORD, and it shall be blessed for ever.

018:001 Now after this it came to pass, that David smote the
        Philistines, and subdued them, and took Gath and her towns out
        of the hand of the Philistines.

018:002 And he smote Moab; and the Moabites became David's servants,
        and brought gifts.

018:003 And David smote Hadarezer king of Zobah unto Hamath, as he
        went to stablish his dominion by the river Euphrates.

018:004 And David took from him a thousand chariots, and seven
        thousand horsemen, and twenty thousand footmen: David also
        houghed all the chariot horses, but reserved of them an
        hundred chariots.

018:005 And when the Syrians of Damascus came to help Hadarezer king
        of Zobah, David slew of the Syrians two and twenty thousand
        men.

018:006 Then David put garrisons in Syriadamascus; and the Syrians
        became David's servants, and brought gifts. Thus the LORD
        preserved David whithersoever he went.

018:007 And David took the shields of gold that were on the servants
        of Hadarezer, and brought them to Jerusalem.

018:008 Likewise from Tibhath, and from Chun, cities of Hadarezer,
        brought David very much brass, wherewith Solomon made the
        brasen sea, and the pillars, and the vessels of brass.

018:009 Now when Tou king of Hamath heard how David had smitten all
        the host of Hadarezer king of Zobah;

018:010 He sent Hadoram his son to king David, to enquire of his
        welfare, and to congratulate him, because he had fought
        against Hadarezer, and smitten him; (for Hadarezer had war
        with Tou;) and with him all manner of vessels of gold and
        silver and brass.

018:011 Them also king David dedicated unto the LORD, with the silver
        and the gold that he brought from all these nations; from
        Edom, and from Moab, and from the children of Ammon, and from
        the Philistines, and from Amalek.

018:012 Moreover Abishai the son of Zeruiah slew of the Edomites in
        the valley of salt eighteen thousand.

018:013 And he put garrisons in Edom; and all the Edomites became
        David's servants. Thus the LORD preserved David whithersoever
        he went.

018:014 So David reigned over all Israel, and executed judgment and
        justice among all his people.

018:015 And Joab the son of Zeruiah was over the host; and Jehoshaphat
        the son of Ahilud, recorder.

018:016 And Zadok the son of Ahitub, and Abimelech the son of
        Abiathar, were the priests; and Shavsha was scribe;

018:017 And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was over the Cherethites and
        the Pelethites; and the sons of David were chief about the
        king.

019:001 Now it came to pass after this, that Nahash the king of the
        children of Ammon died, and his son reigned in his stead.

019:002 And David said, I will shew kindness unto Hanun the son of
        Nahash, because his father shewed kindness to me. And David
        sent messengers to comfort him concerning his father. So the
        servants of David came into the land of the children of Ammon
        to Hanun, to comfort him.

019:003 But the princes of the children of Ammon said to Hanun,
        Thinkest thou that David doth honour thy father, that he hath
        sent comforters unto thee? are not his servants come unto thee
        for to search, and to overthrow, and to spy out the land?

019:004 Wherefore Hanun took David's servants, and shaved them, and
        cut off their garments in the midst hard by their buttocks,
        and sent them away.

019:005 Then there went certain, and told David how the men were
        served. And he sent to meet them: for the men were greatly
        ashamed. And the king said, Tarry at Jericho until your beards
        be grown, and then return.

019:006 And when the children of Ammon saw that they had made
        themselves odious to David, Hanun and the children of Ammon
        sent a thousand talents of silver to hire them chariots and
        horsemen out of Mesopotamia, and out of Syriamaachah, and out
        of Zobah.

019:007 So they hired thirty and two thousand chariots, and the king
        of Maachah and his people; who came and pitched before Medeba.
        And the children of Ammon gathered themselves together from
        their cities, and came to battle.

019:008 And when David heard of it, he sent Joab, and all the host of
        the mighty men.

019:009 And the children of Ammon came out, and put the battle in
        array before the gate of the city: and the kings that were
        come were by themselves in the field.

019:010 Now when Joab saw that the battle was set against him before
        and behind, he chose out of all the choice of Israel, and put
        them in array against the Syrians.

019:011 And the rest of the people he delivered unto the hand of
        Abishai his brother, and they set themselves in array against
        the children of Ammon.

019:012 And he said, If the Syrians be too strong for me, then thou
        shalt help me: but if the children of Ammon be too strong for
        thee, then I will help thee.

019:013 Be of good courage, and let us behave ourselves valiantly for
        our people, and for the cities of our God: and let the LORD do
        that which is good in his sight.

019:014 So Joab and the people that were with him drew nigh before the
        Syrians unto the battle; and they fled before him.

019:015 And when the children of Ammon saw that the Syrians were fled,
        they likewise fled before Abishai his brother, and entered
        into the city. Then Joab came to Jerusalem.

019:016 And when the Syrians saw that they were put to the worse
        before Israel, they sent messengers, and drew forth the
        Syrians that were beyond the river: and Shophach the captain
        of the host of Hadarezer went before them.

019:017 And it was told David; and he gathered all Israel, and passed
        over Jordan, and came upon them, and set the battle in array
        against them. So when David had put the battle in array
        against the Syrians, they fought with him.

019:018 But the Syrians fled before Israel; and David slew of the
        Syrians seven thousand men which fought in chariots, and forty
        thousand footmen, and killed Shophach the captain of the host.

019:019 And when the servants of Hadarezer saw that they were put to
        the worse before Israel, they made peace with David, and
        became his servants: neither would the Syrians help the
        children of Ammon any more.

020:001 And it came to pass, that after the year was expired, at the
        time that kings go out to battle, Joab led forth the power of
        the army, and wasted the country of the children of Ammon, and
        came and besieged Rabbah. But David tarried at Jerusalem. And
        Joab smote Rabbah, and destroyed it.

020:002 And David took the crown of their king from off his head, and
        found it to weigh a talent of gold, and there were precious
        stones in it; and it was set upon David's head: and he brought
        also exceeding much spoil out of the city.

020:003 And he brought out the people that were in it, and cut them
        with saws, and with harrows of iron, and with axes. Even so
        dealt David with all the cities of the children of Ammon. And
        David and all the people returned to Jerusalem.

020:004 And it came to pass after this, that there arose war at Gezer
        with the Philistines; at which time Sibbechai the Hushathite
        slew Sippai, that was of the children of the giant: and they
        were subdued.

020:005 And there was war again with the Philistines; and Elhanan the
        son of Jair slew Lahmi the brother of Goliath the Gittite,
        whose spear staff was like a weaver's beam.

020:006 And yet again there was war at Gath, where was a man of great
        stature, whose fingers and toes were four and twenty, six on
        each hand, and six on each foot and he also was the son of the
        giant.

020:007 But when he defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimea David's
        brother slew him.

020:008 These were born unto the giant in Gath; and they fell by the
        hand of David, and by the hand of his servants.

021:001 And Satan stood up against Israel, and provoked David to
        number Israel.

021:002 And David said to Joab and to the rulers of the people, Go,
        number Israel from Beersheba even to Dan; and bring the number
        of them to me, that I may know it.

021:003 And Joab answered, The LORD make his people an hundred times
        so many more as they be: but, my lord the king, are they not
        all my lord's servants? why then doth my lord require this
        thing? why will he be a cause of trespass to Israel?

021:004 Nevertheless the king's word prevailed against Joab. Wherefore
        Joab departed, and went throughout all Israel, and came to
        Jerusalem.

021:005 And Joab gave the sum of the number of the people unto David.
        And all they of Israel were a thousand thousand and an hundred
        thousand men that drew sword: and Judah was four hundred
        threescore and ten thousand men that drew sword.

021:006 But Levi and Benjamin counted he not among them: for the
        king's word was abominable to Joab.

021:007 And God was displeased with this thing; therefore he smote
        Israel.

021:008 And David said unto God, I have sinned greatly, because I have
        done this thing: but now, I beseech thee, do away the iniquity
        of thy servant; for I have done very foolishly.

021:009 And the LORD spake unto Gad, David's seer, saying,

021:010 Go and tell David, saying, Thus saith the LORD, I offer thee
        three things: choose thee one of them, that I may do it unto
        thee.

021:011 So Gad came to David, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD,
        Choose thee

021:012 Either three years' famine; or three months to be destroyed
        before thy foes, while that the sword of thine enemies
        overtaketh thee; or else three days the sword of the LORD,
        even the pestilence, in the land, and the angel of the LORD
        destroying throughout all the coasts of Israel. Now therefore
        advise thyself what word I shall bring again to him that sent
        me.

021:013 And David said unto Gad, I am in a great strait: let me fall
        now into the hand of the LORD; for very great are his mercies:
        but let me not fall into the hand of man.

021:014 So the LORD sent pestilence upon Israel: and there fell of
        Israel seventy thousand men.

021:015 And God sent an angel unto Jerusalem to destroy it: and as he
        was destroying, the LORD beheld, and he repented him of the
        evil, and said to the angel that destroyed, It is enough, stay
        now thine hand. And the angel of the LORD stood by the
        threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite.

021:016 And David lifted up his eyes, and saw the angel of the LORD
        stand between the earth and the heaven, having a drawn sword
        in his hand stretched out over Jerusalem. Then David and the
        elders of Israel, who were clothed in sackcloth, fell upon
        their faces.

021:017 And David said unto God, Is it not I that commanded the people
        to be numbered? even I it is that have sinned and done evil
        indeed; but as for these sheep, what have they done? let thine
        hand, I pray thee, O LORD my God, be on me, and on my father's
        house; but not on thy people, that they should be plagued.

021:018 Then the angel of the LORD commanded Gad to say to David, that
        David should go up, and set up an altar unto the LORD in the
        threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite.

021:019 And David went up at the saying of Gad, which he spake in the
        name of the LORD.

021:020 And Ornan turned back, and saw the angel; and his four sons
        with him hid themselves. Now Ornan was threshing wheat.

021:021 And as David came to Ornan, Ornan looked and saw David, and
        went out of the threshingfloor, and bowed himself to David
        with his face to the ground.

021:022 Then David said to Ornan, Grant me the place of this
        threshingfloor, that I may build an altar therein unto the
        LORD: thou shalt grant it me for the full price: that the
        plague may be stayed from the people.

021:023 And Ornan said unto David, Take it to thee, and let my lord
        the king do that which is good in his eyes: lo, I give thee
        the oxen also for burnt offerings, and the threshing
        instruments for wood, and the wheat for the meat offering; I
        give it all.

021:024 And king David said to Ornan, Nay; but I will verily buy it
        for the full price: for I will not take that which is thine
        for the LORD, nor offer burnt offerings without cost.

021:025 So David gave to Ornan for the place six hundred shekels of
        gold by weight.

021:026 And David built there an altar unto the LORD, and offered
        burnt offerings and peace offerings, and called upon the LORD;
        and he answered him from heaven by fire upon the altar of
        burnt offering.

021:027 And the LORD commanded the angel; and he put up his sword
        again into the sheath thereof.

021:028 At that time when David saw that the LORD had answered him in
        the threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite, then he sacrificed
        there.

021:029 For the tabernacle of the LORD, which Moses made in the
        wilderness, and the altar of the burnt offering, were at that
        season in the high place at Gibeon.

021:030 But David could not go before it to enquire of God: for he was
        afraid because of the sword of the angel of the LORD.

022:001 Then David said, This is the house of the LORD God, and this
        is the altar of the burnt offering for Israel.

022:002 And David commanded to gather together the strangers that were
        in the land of Israel; and he set masons to hew wrought stones
        to build the house of God.

022:003 And David prepared iron in abundance for the nails for the
        doors of the gates, and for the joinings; and brass in
        abundance without weight;

022:004 Also cedar trees in abundance: for the Zidonians and they of
        Tyre brought much cedar wood to David.

022:005 And David said, Solomon my son is young and tender, and the
        house that is to be builded for the LORD must be exceeding
        magnifical, of fame and of glory throughout all countries: I
        will therefore now make preparation for it. So David prepared
        abundantly before his death.

022:006 Then he called for Solomon his son, and charged him to build
        an house for the LORD God of Israel.

022:007 And David said to Solomon, My son, as for me, it was in my
        mind to build an house unto the name of the LORD my God:

022:008 But the word of the LORD came to me, saying, Thou hast shed
        blood abundantly, and hast made great wars: thou shalt not
        build an house unto my name, because thou hast shed much blood
        upon the earth in my sight.

022:009 Behold, a son shall be born to thee, who shall be a man of
        rest; and I will give him rest from all his enemies round
        about: for his name shall be Solomon, and I will give peace
        and quietness unto Israel in his days.

022:010 He shall build an house for my name; and he shall be my son,
        and I will be his father; and I will establish the throne of
        his kingdom over Israel for ever.

022:011 Now, my son, the LORD be with thee; and prosper thou, and
        build the house of the LORD thy God, as he hath said of thee.

022:012 Only the LORD give thee wisdom and understanding, and give
        thee charge concerning Israel, that thou mayest keep the law
        of the LORD thy God.

022:013 Then shalt thou prosper, if thou takest heed to fulfil the
        statutes and judgments which the LORD charged Moses with
        concerning Israel: be strong, and of good courage; dread not,
        nor be dismayed.

022:014 Now, behold, in my trouble I have prepared for the house of
        the LORD an hundred thousand talents of gold, and a thousand
        thousand talents of silver; and of brass and iron without
        weight; for it is in abundance: timber also and stone have I
        prepared; and thou mayest add thereto.

022:015 Moreover there are workmen with thee in abundance, hewers and
        workers of stone and timber, and all manner of cunning men for
        every manner of work.

022:016 Of the gold, the silver, and the brass, and the iron, there is
        no number. Arise therefore, and be doing, and the LORD be with
        thee.

022:017 David also commanded all the princes of Israel to help Solomon
        his son, saying,

022:018 Is not the LORD your God with you? and hath he not given you
        rest on every side? for he hath given the inhabitants of the
        land into mine hand; and the land is subdued before the LORD,
        and before his people.

022:019 Now set your heart and your soul to seek the LORD your God;
        arise therefore, and build ye the sanctuary of the LORD God,
        to bring the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and the holy
        vessels of God, into the house that is to be built to the name
        of the LORD.

023:001 So when David was old and full of days, he made Solomon his
        son king over Israel.

023:002 And he gathered together all the princes of Israel, with the
        priests and the Levites.

023:003 Now the Levites were numbered from the age of thirty years and
        upward: and their number by their polls, man by man, was
        thirty and eight thousand.

023:004 Of which, twenty and four thousand were to set forward the
        work of the house of the LORD; and six thousand were officers
        and judges:

023:005 Moreover four thousand were porters; and four thousand praised
        the LORD with the instruments which I made, said David, to
        praise therewith.

023:006 And David divided them into courses among the sons of Levi,
        namely, Gershon, Kohath, and Merari.

023:007 Of the Gershonites were, Laadan, and Shimei.

023:008 The sons of Laadan; the chief was Jehiel, and Zetham, and
        Joel, three.

023:009 The sons of Shimei; Shelomith, and Haziel, and Haran, three.
        These were the chief of the fathers of Laadan.

023:010 And the sons of Shimei were, Jahath, Zina, and Jeush, and
        Beriah. These four were the sons of Shimei.

023:011 And Jahath was the chief, and Zizah the second: but Jeush and
        Beriah had not many sons; therefore they were in one
        reckoning, according to their father's house.

023:012 The sons of Kohath; Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel, four.

023:013 The sons of Amram; Aaron and Moses: and Aaron was separated,
        that he should sanctify the most holy things, he and his sons
        for ever, to burn incense before the LORD, to minister unto
        him, and to bless in his name for ever.

023:014 Now concerning Moses the man of God, his sons were named of
        the tribe of Levi.

023:015 The sons of Moses were, Gershom, and Eliezer.

023:016 Of the sons of Gershom, Shebuel was the chief.

023:017 And the sons of Eliezer were, Rehabiah the chief. And Eliezer
        had none other sons; but the sons of Rehabiah were very many.

023:018 Of the sons of Izhar; Shelomith the chief.

023:019 Of the sons of Hebron; Jeriah the first, Amariah the second,
        Jahaziel the third, and Jekameam the fourth.

023:020 Of the sons of Uzziel; Micah the first and Jesiah the second.

023:021 The sons of Merari; Mahli, and Mushi. The sons of Mahli;
        Eleazar, and Kish.

023:022 And Eleazar died, and had no sons, but daughters: and their
        brethren the sons of Kish took them.

023:023 The sons of Mushi; Mahli, and Eder, and Jeremoth, three.

023:024 These were the sons of Levi after the house of their fathers;
        even the chief of the fathers, as they were counted by number
        of names by their polls, that did the work for the service of
        the house of the LORD, from the age of twenty years and
        upward.

023:025 For David said, The LORD God of Israel hath given rest unto
        his people, that they may dwell in Jerusalem for ever:

023:026 And also unto the Levites; they shall no more carry the
        tabernacle, nor any vessels of it for the service thereof.

023:027 For by the last words of David the Levites were numbered from
        twenty years old and above:

023:028 Because their office was to wait on the sons of Aaron for the
        service of the house of the LORD, in the courts, and in the
        chambers, and in the purifying of all holy things, and the
        work of the service of the house of God;

023:029 Both for the shewbread, and for the fine flour for meat
        offering, and for the unleavened cakes, and for that which is
        baked in the pan, and for that which is fried, and for all
        manner of measure and size;

023:030 And to stand every morning to thank and praise the LORD, and
        likewise at even:

023:031 And to offer all burnt sacrifices unto the LORD in the
        sabbaths, in the new moons, and on the set feasts, by number,
        according to the order commanded unto them, continually before
        the LORD:

023:032 And that they should keep the charge of the tabernacle of the
        congregation, and the charge of the holy place, and the charge
        of the sons of Aaron their brethren, in the service of the
        house of the LORD.

024:001 Now these are the divisions of the sons of Aaron. The sons of
        Aaron; Nadab, and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.

024:002 But Nadab and Abihu died before their father, and had no
        children: therefore Eleazar and Ithamar executed the priest's
        office.

024:003 And David distributed them, both Zadok of the sons of Eleazar,
        and Ahimelech of the sons of Ithamar, according to their
        offices in their service.

024:004 And there were more chief men found of the sons of Eleazar
        than of the sons of Ithamar, and thus were they divided. Among
        the sons of Eleazar there were sixteen chief men of the house
        of their fathers, and eight among the sons of Ithamar
        according to the house of their fathers.

024:005 Thus were they divided by lot, one sort with another; for the
        governors of the sanctuary, and governors of the house of God,
        were of the sons of Eleazar, and of the sons of Ithamar.

024:006 And Shemaiah the son of Nethaneel the scribe, one of the
        Levites, wrote them before the king, and the princes, and
        Zadok the priest, and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar, and
        before the chief of the fathers of the priests and Levites:
        one principal household being taken for Eleazar, and one taken
        for Ithamar.

024:007 Now the first lot came forth to Jehoiarib, the second to
        Jedaiah,

024:008 The third to Harim, the fourth to Seorim,

024:009 The fifth to Malchijah, the sixth to Mijamin,

024:010 The seventh to Hakkoz, the eighth to Abijah,

024:011 The ninth to Jeshuah, the tenth to Shecaniah,

024:012 The eleventh to Eliashib, the twelfth to Jakim,

024:013 The thirteenth to Huppah, the fourteenth to Jeshebeab,

024:014 The fifteenth to Bilgah, the sixteenth to Immer,

024:015 The seventeenth to Hezir, the eighteenth to Aphses,

024:016 The nineteenth to Pethahiah, the twentieth to Jehezekel,

024:017 The one and twentieth to Jachin, the two and twentieth to
        Gamul,

024:018 The three and twentieth to Delaiah, the four and twentieth to
        Maaziah.

024:019 These were the orderings of them in their service to come into
        the house of the LORD, according to their manner, under Aaron
        their father, as the LORD God of Israel had commanded him.

024:020 And the rest of the sons of Levi were these: Of the sons of
        Amram; Shubael: of the sons of Shubael; Jehdeiah.

024:021 Concerning Rehabiah: of the sons of Rehabiah, the first was
        Isshiah.

024:022 Of the Izharites; Shelomoth: of the sons of Shelomoth; Jahath.

024:023 And the sons of Hebron; Jeriah the first, Amariah the second,
        Jahaziel the third, Jekameam the fourth.

024:024 Of the sons of Uzziel; Michah: of the sons of Michah; Shamir.

024:025 The brother of Michah was Isshiah: of the sons of Isshiah;
        Zechariah.

024:026 The sons of Merari were Mahli and Mushi: the sons of Jaaziah;
        Beno.

024:027 The sons of Merari by Jaaziah; Beno, and Shoham, and Zaccur,
        and Ibri.

024:028 Of Mahli came Eleazar, who had no sons.

024:029 Concerning Kish: the son of Kish was Jerahmeel.

024:030 The sons also of Mushi; Mahli, and Eder, and Jerimoth. These
        were the sons of the Levites after the house of their fathers.

024:031 These likewise cast lots over against their brethren the sons
        of Aaron in the presence of David the king, and Zadok, and
        Ahimelech, and the chief of the fathers of the priests and
        Levites, even the principal fathers over against their younger
        brethren.

025:001 Moreover David and the captains of the host separated to the
        service of the sons of Asaph, and of Heman, and of Jeduthun,
        who should prophesy with harps, with psalteries, and with
        cymbals: and the number of the workmen according to their
        service was:

025:002 Of the sons of Asaph; Zaccur, and Joseph, and Nethaniah, and
        Asarelah, the sons of Asaph under the hands of Asaph, which
        prophesied according to the order of the king.

025:003 Of Jeduthun: the sons of Jeduthun; Gedaliah, and Zeri, and
        Jeshaiah, Hashabiah, and Mattithiah, six, under the hands of
        their father Jeduthun, who prophesied with a harp, to give
        thanks and to praise the LORD.

025:004 Of Heman: the sons of Heman: Bukkiah, Mattaniah, Uzziel,
        Shebuel, and Jerimoth, Hananiah, Hanani, Eliathah, Giddalti,
        and Romamtiezer, Joshbekashah, Mallothi, Hothir, and
        Mahazioth:

025:005 All these were the sons of Heman the king's seer in the words
        of God, to lift up the horn. And God gave to Heman fourteen
        sons and three daughters.

025:006 All these were under the hands of their father for song in the
        house of the LORD, with cymbals, psalteries, and harps, for
        the service of the house of God, according to the king's order
        to Asaph, Jeduthun, and Heman.

025:007 So the number of them, with their brethren that were
        instructed in the songs of the LORD, even all that were
        cunning, was two hundred fourscore and eight.

025:008 And they cast lots, ward against ward, as well the small as
        the great, the teacher as the scholar.

025:009 Now the first lot came forth for Asaph to Joseph: the second
        to Gedaliah, who with his brethren and sons were twelve:

025:010 The third to Zaccur, he, his sons, and his brethren, were
        twelve:

025:011 The fourth to Izri, he, his sons, and his brethren, were
        twelve:

025:012 The fifth to Nethaniah, he, his sons, and his brethren, were
        twelve:

025:013 The sixth to Bukkiah, he, his sons, and his brethren, were
        twelve:

025:014 The seventh to Jesharelah, he, his sons, and his brethren,
        were twelve:

025:015 The eighth to Jeshaiah, he, his sons, and his brethren, were
        twelve:

025:016 The ninth to Mattaniah, he, his sons, and his brethren, were
        twelve:

025:017 The tenth to Shimei, he, his sons, and his brethren, were
        twelve:

025:018 The eleventh to Azareel, he, his sons, and his brethren, were
        twelve:

025:019 The twelfth to Hashabiah, he, his sons, and his brethren, were
        twelve:

025:020 The thirteenth to Shubael, he, his sons, and his brethren,
        were twelve:

025:021 The fourteenth to Mattithiah, he, his sons, and his brethren,
        were twelve:

025:022 The fifteenth to Jeremoth, he, his sons, and his brethren,
        were twelve:

025:023 The sixteenth to Hananiah, he, his sons, and his brethren,
        were twelve:

025:024 The seventeenth to Joshbekashah, he, his sons, and his
        brethren, were twelve:

025:025 The eighteenth to Hanani, he, his sons, and his brethren, were
        twelve:

025:026 The nineteenth to Mallothi, he, his sons, and his brethren,
        were twelve:

025:027 The twentieth to Eliathah, he, his sons, and his brethren,
        were twelve:

025:028 The one and twentieth to Hothir, he, his sons, and his
        brethren, were twelve:

025:029 The two and twentieth to Giddalti, he, his sons, and his
        brethren, were twelve:

025:030 The three and twentieth to Mahazioth, he, his sons, and his
        brethren, were twelve:

025:031 The four and twentieth to Romamtiezer, he, his sons, and his
        brethren, were twelve.

026:001 Concerning the divisions of the porters: Of the Korhites was
        Meshelemiah the son of Kore, of the sons of Asaph.

026:002 And the sons of Meshelemiah were, Zechariah the firstborn,
        Jediael the second, Zebadiah the third, Jathniel the fourth,

026:003 Elam the fifth, Jehohanan the sixth, Elioenai the seventh.

026:004 Moreover the sons of Obededom were, Shemaiah the firstborn,
        Jehozabad the second, Joah the third, and Sacar the fourth,
        and Nethaneel the fifth.

026:005 Ammiel the sixth, Issachar the seventh, Peulthai the eighth:
        for God blessed him.

026:006 Also unto Shemaiah his son were sons born, that ruled
        throughout the house of their father: for they were mighty men
        of valour.

026:007 The sons of Shemaiah; Othni, and Rephael, and Obed, Elzabad,
        whose brethren were strong men, Elihu, and Semachiah.

026:008 All these of the sons of Obededom: they and their sons and
        their brethren, able men for strength for the service, were
        threescore and two of Obededom.

026:009 And Meshelemiah had sons and brethren, strong men, eighteen.

026:010 Also Hosah, of the children of Merari, had sons; Simri the
        chief, (for though he was not the firstborn, yet his father
        made him the chief;)

026:011 Hilkiah the second, Tebaliah the third, Zechariah the fourth:
        all the sons and brethren of Hosah were thirteen.

026:012 Among these were the divisions of the porters, even among the
        chief men, having wards one against another, to minister in
        the house of the LORD.

026:013 And they cast lots, as well the small as the great, according
        to the house of their fathers, for every gate.

026:014 And the lot eastward fell to Shelemiah. Then for Zechariah his
        son, a wise counsellor, they cast lots; and his lot came out
        northward.

026:015 To Obededom southward; and to his sons the house of Asuppim.

026:016 To Shuppim and Hosah the lot came forth westward, with the
        gate Shallecheth, by the causeway of the going up, ward
        against ward.

026:017 Eastward were six Levites, northward four a day, southward
        four a day, and toward Asuppim two and two.

026:018 At Parbar westward, four at the causeway, and two at Parbar.

026:019 These are the divisions of the porters among the sons of Kore,
        and among the sons of Merari.

026:020 And of the Levites, Ahijah was over the treasures of the house
        of God, and over the treasures of the dedicated things.

026:021 As concerning the sons of Laadan; the sons of the Gershonite
        Laadan, chief fathers, even of Laadan the Gershonite, were
        Jehieli.

026:022 The sons of Jehieli; Zetham, and Joel his brother, which were
        over the treasures of the house of the LORD.

026:023 Of the Amramites, and the Izharites, the Hebronites, and the
        Uzzielites:

026:024 And Shebuel the son of Gershom, the son of Moses, was ruler of
        the treasures.

026:025 And his brethren by Eliezer; Rehabiah his son, and Jeshaiah
        his son, and Joram his son, and Zichri his son, and Shelomith
        his son.

026:026 Which Shelomith and his brethren were over all the treasures
        of the dedicated things, which David the king, and the chief
        fathers, the captains over thousands and hundreds, and the
        captains of the host, had dedicated.

026:027 Out of the spoils won in battles did they dedicate to maintain
        the house of the LORD.

026:028 And all that Samuel the seer, and Saul the son of Kish, and
        Abner the son of Ner, and Joab the son of Zeruiah, had
        dedicated; and whosoever had dedicated any thing, it was under
        the hand of Shelomith, and of his brethren.

026:029 Of the Izharites, Chenaniah and his sons were for the outward
        business over Israel, for officers and judges.

026:030 And of the Hebronites, Hashabiah and his brethren, men of
        valour, a thousand and seven hundred, were officers among them
        of Israel on this side Jordan westward in all the business of
        the LORD, and in the service of the king.

026:031 Among the Hebronites was Jerijah the chief, even among the
        Hebronites, according to the generations of his fathers. In
        the fortieth year of the reign of David they were sought for,
        and there were found among them mighty men of valour at Jazer
        of Gilead.

026:032 And his brethren, men of valour, were two thousand and seven
        hundred chief fathers, whom king David made rulers over the
        Reubenites, the Gadites, and the half tribe of Manasseh, for
        every matter pertaining to God, and affairs of the king.

027:001 Now the children of Israel after their number, to wit, the
        chief fathers and captains of thousands and hundreds, and
        their officers that served the king in any matter of the
        courses, which came in and went out month by month throughout
        all the months of the year, of every course were twenty and
        four thousand.

027:002 Over the first course for the first month was Jashobeam the
        son of Zabdiel: and in his course were twenty and four
        thousand.

027:003 Of the children of Perez was the chief of all the captains of
        the host for the first month.

027:004 And over the course of the second month was Dodai an Ahohite,
        and of his course was Mikloth also the ruler: in his course
        likewise were twenty and four thousand.

027:005 The third captain of the host for the third month was Benaiah
        the son of Jehoiada, a chief priest: and in his course were
        twenty and four thousand.

027:006 This is that Benaiah, who was mighty among the thirty, and
        above the thirty: and in his course was Ammizabad his son.

027:007 The fourth captain for the fourth month was Asahel the brother
        of Joab, and Zebadiah his son after him: and in his course
        were twenty and four thousand.

027:008 The fifth captain for the fifth month was Shamhuth the
        Izrahite: and in his course were twenty and four thousand.

027:009 The sixth captain for the sixth month was Ira the son of
        Ikkesh the Tekoite: and in his course were twenty and four
        thousand.

027:010 The seventh captain for the seventh month was Helez the
        Pelonite, of the children of Ephraim: and in his course were
        twenty and four thousand.

027:011 The eighth captain for the eighth month was Sibbecai the
        Hushathite, of the Zarhites: and in his course were twenty and
        four thousand.

027:012 The ninth captain for the ninth month was Abiezer the
        Anetothite, of the Benjamites: and in his course were twenty
        and four thousand.

027:013 The tenth captain for the tenth month was Maharai the
        Netophathite, of the Zarhites: and in his course were twenty
        and four thousand.

027:014 The eleventh captain for the eleventh month was Benaiah the
        Pirathonite, of the children of Ephraim: and in his course
        were twenty and four thousand.

027:015 The twelfth captain for the twelfth month was Heldai the
        Netophathite, of Othniel: and in his course were twenty and
        four thousand.

027:016 Furthermore over the tribes of Israel: the ruler of the
        Reubenites was Eliezer the son of Zichri: of the Simeonites,
        Shephatiah the son of Maachah:

027:017 Of the Levites, Hashabiah the son of Kemuel: of the Aaronites,
        Zadok:

027:018 Of Judah, Elihu, one of the brethren of David: of Issachar,
        Omri the son of Michael:

027:019 Of Zebulun, Ishmaiah the son of Obadiah: of Naphtali, Jerimoth
        the son of Azriel:

027:020 Of the children of Ephraim, Hoshea the son of Azaziah: of the
        half tribe of Manasseh, Joel the son of Pedaiah:

027:021 Of the half tribe of Manasseh in Gilead, Iddo the son of
        Zechariah: of Benjamin, Jaasiel the son of Abner:

027:022 Of Dan, Azareel the son of Jeroham. These were the princes of
        the tribes of Israel.

027:023 But David took not the number of them from twenty years old
        and under: because the LORD had said he would increase Israel
        like to the stars of the heavens.

027:024 Joab the son of Zeruiah began to number, but he finished not,
        because there fell wrath for it against Israel; neither was
        the number put in the account of the chronicles of king David.

027:025 And over the king's treasures was Azmaveth the son of Adiel:
        and over the storehouses in the fields, in the cities, and in
        the villages, and in the castles, was Jehonathan the son of
        Uzziah:

027:026 And over them that did the work of the field for tillage of
        the ground was Ezri the son of Chelub:

027:027 And over the vineyards was Shimei the Ramathite: over the
        increase of the vineyards for the wine cellars was Zabdi the
        Shiphmite:

027:028 And over the olive trees and the sycomore trees that were in
        the low plains was Baalhanan the Gederite: and over the
        cellars of oil was Joash:

027:029 And over the herds that fed in Sharon was Shitrai the
        Sharonite: and over the herds that were in the valleys was
        Shaphat the son of Adlai:

027:030 Over the camels also was Obil the Ishmaelite: and over the
        asses was Jehdeiah the Meronothite:

027:031 And over the flocks was Jaziz the Hagerite. All these were the
        rulers of the substance which was king David's.

027:032 Also Jonathan David's uncle was a counsellor, a wise man, and
        a scribe: and Jehiel the son of Hachmoni was with the king's
        sons:

027:033 And Ahithophel was the king's counsellor: and Hushai the
        Archite was the king's companion:

027:034 And after Ahithophel was Jehoiada the son of Benaiah, and
        Abiathar: and the general of the king's army was Joab.

028:001 And David assembled all the princes of Israel, the princes of
        the tribes, and the captains of the companies that ministered
        to the king by course, and the captains over the thousands,
        and captains over the hundreds, and the stewards over all the
        substance and possession of the king, and of his sons, with
        the officers, and with the mighty men, and with all the
        valiant men, unto Jerusalem.

028:002 Then David the king stood up upon his feet, and said, Hear me,
        my brethren, and my people: As for me, I had in mine heart to
        build an house of rest for the ark of the covenant of the
        LORD, and for the footstool of our God, and had made ready for
        the building:

028:003 But God said unto me, Thou shalt not build an house for my
        name, because thou hast been a man of war, and hast shed
        blood.

028:004 Howbeit the LORD God of Israel chose me before all the house
        of my father to be king over Israel for ever: for he hath
        chosen Judah to be the ruler; and of the house of Judah, the
        house of my father; and among the sons of my father he liked
        me to make me king over all Israel:

028:005 And of all my sons, (for the LORD hath given me many sons,) he
        hath chosen Solomon my son to sit upon the throne of the
        kingdom of the LORD over Israel.

028:006 And he said unto me, Solomon thy son, he shall build my house
        and my courts: for I have chosen him to be my son, and I will
        be his father.

028:007 Moreover I will establish his kingdom for ever, if he be
        constant to do my commandments and my judgments, as at this
        day.

028:008 Now therefore in the sight of all Israel the congregation of
        the LORD, and in the audience of our God, keep and seek for
        all the commandments of the LORD your God: that ye may possess
        this good land, and leave it for an inheritance for your
        children after you for ever.

028:009 And thou, Solomon my son, know thou the God of thy father, and
        serve him with a perfect heart and with a willing mind: for
        the LORD searcheth all hearts, and understandeth all the
        imaginations of the thoughts: if thou seek him, he will be
        found of thee; but if thou forsake him, he will cast thee off
        for ever.

028:010 Take heed now; for the LORD hath chosen thee to build an house
        for the sanctuary: be strong, and do it.

028:011 Then David gave to Solomon his son the pattern of the porch,
        and of the houses thereof, and of the treasuries thereof, and
        of the upper chambers thereof, and of the inner parlours
        thereof, and of the place of the mercy seat,

028:012 And the pattern of all that he had by the spirit, of the
        courts of the house of the LORD, and of all the chambers round
        about, of the treasuries of the house of God, and of the
        treasuries of the dedicated things:

028:013 Also for the courses of the priests and the Levites, and for
        all the work of the service of the house of the LORD, and for
        all the vessels of service in the house of the LORD.

028:014 He gave of gold by weight for things of gold, for all
        instruments of all manner of service; silver also for all
        instruments of silver by weight, for all instruments of every
        kind of service:

028:015 Even the weight for the candlesticks of gold, and for their
        lamps of gold, by weight for every candlestick, and for the
        lamps thereof: and for the candlesticks of silver by weight,
        both for the candlestick, and also for the lamps thereof,
        according to the use of every candlestick.

028:016 And by weight he gave gold for the tables of shewbread, for
        every table; and likewise silver for the tables of silver:

028:017 Also pure gold for the fleshhooks, and the bowls, and the
        cups: and for the golden basons he gave gold by weight for
        every bason; and likewise silver by weight for every bason of
        silver:

028:018 And for the altar of incense refined gold by weight; and gold
        for the pattern of the chariot of the cherubims, that spread
        out their wings, and covered the ark of the covenant of the
        LORD.

028:019 All this, said David, the LORD made me understand in writing
        by his hand upon me, even all the works of this pattern.

028:020 And David said to Solomon his son, Be strong and of good
        courage, and do it: fear not, nor be dismayed: for the LORD
        God, even my God, will be with thee; he will not fail thee,
        nor forsake thee, until thou hast finished all the work for
        the service of the house of the LORD.

028:021 And, behold, the courses of the priests and the Levites, even
        they shall be with thee for all the service of the house of
        God: and there shall be with thee for all manner of
        workmanship every willing skilful man, for any manner of
        service: also the princes and all the people will be wholly at
        thy commandment.

029:001 Furthermore David the king said unto all the congregation,
        Solomon my son, whom alone God hath chosen, is yet young and
        tender, and the work is great: for the palace is not for man,
        but for the LORD God.

029:002 Now I have prepared with all my might for the house of my God
        the gold for things to be made of gold, and the silver for
        things of silver, and the brass for things of brass, the iron
        for things of iron, and wood for things of wood; onyx stones,
        and stones to be set, glistering stones, and of divers
        colours, and all manner of precious stones, and marble stones
        in abundance.

029:003 Moreover, because I have set my affection to the house of my
        God, I have of mine own proper good, of gold and silver, which
        I have given to the house of my God, over and above all that I
        have prepared for the holy house.

029:004 Even three thousand talents of gold, of the gold of Ophir, and
        seven thousand talents of refined silver, to overlay the walls
        of the houses withal:

029:005 The gold for things of gold, and the silver for things of
        silver, and for all manner of work to be made by the hands of
        artificers. And who then is willing to consecrate his service
        this day unto the LORD?

029:006 Then the chief of the fathers and princes of the tribes of
        Israel and the captains of thousands and of hundreds, with the
        rulers of the king's work, offered willingly,

029:007 And gave for the service of the house of God of gold five
        thousand talents and ten thousand drams, and of silver ten
        thousand talents, and of brass eighteen thousand talents, and
        one hundred thousand talents of iron.

029:008 And they with whom precious stones were found gave them to the
        treasure of the house of the LORD, by the hand of Jehiel the
        Gershonite.

029:009 Then the people rejoiced, for that they offered willingly,
        because with perfect heart they offered willingly to the LORD:
        and David the king also rejoiced with great joy.

029:010 Wherefore David blessed the LORD before all the congregation:
        and David said, Blessed be thou, LORD God of Israel our
        father, for ever and ever.

029:011 Thine, O LORD is the greatness, and the power, and the glory,
        and the victory, and the majesty: for all that is in the
        heaven and in the earth is thine; thine is the kingdom, O
        LORD, and thou art exalted as head above all.

029:012 Both riches and honour come of thee, and thou reignest over
        all; and in thine hand is power and might; and in thine hand
        it is to make great, and to give strength unto all.

029:013 Now therefore, our God, we thank thee, and praise thy glorious
        name.

029:014 But who am I, and what is my people, that we should be able to
        offer so willingly after this sort? for all things come of
        thee, and of thine own have we given thee.

029:015 For we are strangers before thee, and sojourners, as were all
        our fathers: our days on the earth are as a shadow, and there
        is none abiding.

029:016 O LORD our God, all this store that we have prepared to build
        thee an house for thine holy name cometh of thine hand, and is
        all thine own.

029:017 I know also, my God, that thou triest the heart, and hast
        pleasure in uprightness. As for me, in the uprightness of mine
        heart I have willingly offered all these things: and now have
        I seen with joy thy people, which are present here, to offer
        willingly unto thee.

029:018 O LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and of Israel, our fathers, keep
        this for ever in the imagination of the thoughts of the heart
        of thy people, and prepare their heart unto thee:

029:019 And give unto Solomon my son a perfect heart, to keep thy
        commandments, thy testimonies, and thy statutes, and to do all
        these things, and to build the palace, for the which I have
        made provision.

029:020 And David said to all the congregation, Now bless the LORD
        your God. And all the congregation blessed the LORD God of
        their fathers, and bowed down their heads, and worshipped the
        LORD, and the king.

029:021 And they sacrificed sacrifices unto the LORD, and offered
        burnt offerings unto the LORD, on the morrow after that day,
        even a thousand bullocks, a thousand rams, and a thousand
        lambs, with their drink offerings, and sacrifices in abundance
        for all Israel:

029:022 And did eat and drink before the LORD on that day with great
        gladness. And they made Solomon the son of David king the
        second time, and anointed him unto the LORD to be the chief
        governor, and Zadok to be priest.

029:023 Then Solomon sat on the throne of the LORD as king instead of
        David his father, and prospered; and all Israel obeyed him.

029:024 And all the princes, and the mighty men, and all the sons
        likewise of king David, submitted themselves unto Solomon the
        king.

029:025 And the LORD magnified Solomon exceedingly in the sight of all
        Israel, and bestowed upon him such royal majesty as had not
        been on any king before him in Israel.

029:026 Thus David the son of Jesse reigned over all Israel.

029:027 And the time that he reigned over Israel was forty years;
        seven years reigned he in Hebron, and thirty and three years
        reigned he in Jerusalem.

029:028 And he died in a good old age, full of days, riches, and
        honour: and Solomon his son reigned in his stead.

029:029 Now the acts of David the king, first and last, behold, they
        are written in the book of Samuel the seer, and in the book of
        Nathan the prophet, and in the book of Gad the seer,

029:030 With all his reign and his might, and the times that went over
        him, and over Israel, and over all the kingdoms of the
        countries.

Book 14	2 Chronicles

001:001 And Solomon the son of David was strengthened in his kingdom,
        and the LORD his God was with him, and magnified him
        exceedingly.

001:002 Then Solomon spake unto all Israel, to the captains of
        thousands and of hundreds, and to the judges, and to every
        governor in all Israel, the chief of the fathers.

001:003 So Solomon, and all the congregation with him, went to the
        high place that was at Gibeon; for there was the tabernacle of
        the congregation of God, which Moses the servant of the LORD
        had made in the wilderness.

001:004 But the ark of God had David brought up from Kirjathjearim to
        the place which David had prepared for it: for he had pitched
        a tent for it at Jerusalem.

001:005 Moreover the brasen altar, that Bezaleel the son of Uri, the
        son of Hur, had made, he put before the tabernacle of the
        LORD: and Solomon and the congregation sought unto it.

001:006 And Solomon went up thither to the brasen altar before the
        LORD, which was at the tabernacle of the congregation, and
        offered a thousand burnt offerings upon it.

001:007 In that night did God appear unto Solomon, and said unto him,
        Ask what I shall give thee.

001:008 And Solomon said unto God, Thou hast shewed great mercy unto
        David my father, and hast made me to reign in his stead.

001:009 Now, O LORD God, let thy promise unto David my father be
        established: for thou hast made me king over a people like the
        dust of the earth in multitude.

001:010 Give me now wisdom and knowledge, that I may go out and come
        in before this people: for who can judge this thy people, that
        is so great?

001:011 And God said to Solomon, Because this was in thine heart, and
        thou hast not asked riches, wealth, or honour, nor the life of
        thine enemies, neither yet hast asked long life; but hast
        asked wisdom and knowledge for thyself, that thou mayest judge
        my people, over whom I have made thee king:

001:012 Wisdom and knowledge is granted unto thee; and I will give
        thee riches, and wealth, and honour, such as none of the kings
        have had that have been before thee, neither shall there any
        after thee have the like.

001:013 Then Solomon came from his journey to the high place that was
        at Gibeon to Jerusalem, from before the tabernacle of the
        congregation, and reigned over Israel.

001:014 And Solomon gathered chariots and horsemen: and he had a
        thousand and four hundred chariots, and twelve thousand
        horsemen, which he placed in the chariot cities, and with the
        king at Jerusalem.

001:015 And the king made silver and gold at Jerusalem as plenteous as
        stones, and cedar trees made he as the sycomore trees that are
        in the vale for abundance.

001:016 And Solomon had horses brought out of Egypt, and linen yarn:
        the king's merchants received the linen yarn at a price.

001:017 And they fetched up, and brought forth out of Egypt a chariot
        for six hundred shekels of silver, and an horse for an hundred
        and fifty: and so brought they out horses for all the kings of
        the Hittites, and for the kings of Syria, by their means.

002:001 And Solomon determined to build an house for the name of the
        LORD, and an house for his kingdom.

002:002 And Solomon told out threescore and ten thousand men to bear
        burdens, and fourscore thousand to hew in the mountain, and
        three thousand and six hundred to oversee them.

002:003 And Solomon sent to Huram the king of Tyre, saying, As thou
        didst deal with David my father, and didst send him cedars to
        build him an house to dwell therein, even so deal with me.

002:004 Behold, I build an house to the name of the LORD my God, to
        dedicate it to him, and to burn before him sweet incense, and
        for the continual shewbread, and for the burnt offerings
        morning and evening, on the sabbaths, and on the new moons,
        and on the solemn feasts of the LORD our God. This is an
        ordinance for ever to Israel.

002:005 And the house which I build is great: for great is our God
        above all gods.

002:006 But who is able to build him an house, seeing the heaven and
        heaven of heavens cannot contain him? who am I then, that I
        should build him an house, save only to burn sacrifice before
        him?

002:007 Send me now therefore a man cunning to work in gold, and in
        silver, and in brass, and in iron, and in purple, and crimson,
        and blue, and that can skill to grave with the cunning men
        that are with me in Judah and in Jerusalem, whom David my
        father did provide.

002:008 Send me also cedar trees, fir trees, and algum trees, out of
        Lebanon: for I know that thy servants can skill to cut timber
        in Lebanon; and, behold, my servants shall be with thy
        servants,

002:009 Even to prepare me timber in abundance: for the house which I
        am about to build shall be wonderful great.

002:010 And, behold, I will give to thy servants, the hewers that cut
        timber, twenty thousand measures of beaten wheat, and twenty
        thousand measures of barley, and twenty thousand baths of
        wine, and twenty thousand baths of oil.

002:011 Then Huram the king of Tyre answered in writing, which he sent
        to Solomon, Because the LORD hath loved his people, he hath
        made thee king over them.

002:012 Huram said moreover, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, that
        made heaven and earth, who hath given to David the king a wise
        son, endued with prudence and understanding, that might build
        an house for the LORD, and an house for his kingdom.

002:013 And now I have sent a cunning man, endued with understanding,
        of Huram my father's,

002:014 The son of a woman of the daughters of Dan, and his father was
        a man of Tyre, skilful to work in gold, and in silver, in
        brass, in iron, in stone, and in timber, in purple, in blue,
        and in fine linen, and in crimson; also to grave any manner of
        graving, and to find out every device which shall be put to
        him, with thy cunning men, and with the cunning men of my lord
        David thy father.

002:015 Now therefore the wheat, and the barley, the oil, and the
        wine, which my lord hath spoken of, let him send unto his
        servants:

002:016 And we will cut wood out of Lebanon, as much as thou shalt
        need: and we will bring it to thee in floats by sea to Joppa;
        and thou shalt carry it up to Jerusalem.

002:017 And Solomon numbered all the strangers that were in the land
        of Israel, after the numbering wherewith David his father had
        numbered them; and they were found an hundred and fifty
        thousand and three thousand and six hundred.

002:018 And he set threescore and ten thousand of them to be bearers
        of burdens, and fourscore thousand to be hewers in the
        mountain, and three thousand and six hundred overseers to set
        the people a work.

003:001 Then Solomon began to build the house of the LORD at Jerusalem
        in mount Moriah, where the Lord appeared unto David his
        father, in the place that David had prepared in the
        threshingfloor of Ornan the Jebusite.

003:002 And he began to build in the second day of the second month,
        in the fourth year of his reign.

003:003 Now these are the things wherein Solomon was instructed for
        the building of the house of God. The length by cubits after
        the first measure was threescore cubits, and the breadth
        twenty cubits.

003:004 And the porch that was in the front of the house, the length
        of it was according to the breadth of the house, twenty
        cubits, and the height was an hundred and twenty: and he
        overlaid it within with pure gold.

003:005 And the greater house he cieled with fir tree, which he
        overlaid with fine gold, and set thereon palm trees and
        chains.

003:006 And he garnished the house with precious stones for beauty:
        and the gold was gold of Parvaim.

003:007 He overlaid also the house, the beams, the posts, and the
        walls thereof, and the doors thereof, with gold; and graved
        cherubims on the walls.

003:008 And he made the most holy house, the length whereof was
        according to the breadth of the house, twenty cubits, and the
        breadth thereof twenty cubits: and he overlaid it with fine
        gold, amounting to six hundred talents.

003:009 And the weight of the nails was fifty shekels of gold. And he
        overlaid the upper chambers with gold.

003:010 And in the most holy house he made two cherubims of image
        work, and overlaid them with gold.

003:011 And the wings of the cherubims were twenty cubits long: one
        wing of the one cherub was five cubits, reaching to the wall
        of the house: and the other wing was likewise five cubits,
        reaching to the wing of the other cherub.

003:012 And one wing of the other cherub was five cubits, reaching to
        the wall of the house: and the other wing was five cubits
        also, joining to the wing of the other cherub.

003:013 The wings of these cherubims spread themselves forth twenty
        cubits: and they stood on their feet, and their faces were
        inward.

003:014 And he made the vail of blue, and purple, and crimson, and
        fine linen, and wrought cherubims thereon.

003:015 Also he made before the house two pillars of thirty and five
        cubits high, and the chapiter that was on the top of each of
        them was five cubits.

003:016 And he made chains, as in the oracle, and put them on the
        heads of the pillars; and made an hundred pomegranates, and
        put them on the chains.

003:017 And he reared up the pillars before the temple, one on the
        right hand, and the other on the left; and called the name of
        that on the right hand Jachin, and the name of that on the
        left Boaz.

004:001 Moreover he made an altar of brass, twenty cubits the length
        thereof, and twenty cubits the breadth thereof, and ten cubits
        the height thereof.

004:002 Also he made a molten sea of ten cubits from brim to brim,
        round in compass, and five cubits the height thereof; and a
        line of thirty cubits did compass it round about.

004:003 And under it was the similitude of oxen, which did compass it
        round about: ten in a cubit, compassing the sea round about.
        Two rows of oxen were cast, when it was cast.

004:004 It stood upon twelve oxen, three looking toward the north, and
        three looking toward the west, and three looking toward the
        south, and three looking toward the east: and the sea was set
        above upon them, and all their hinder parts were inward.

004:005 And the thickness of it was an handbreadth, and the brim of it
        like the work of the brim of a cup, with flowers of lilies;
        and it received and held three thousand baths.

004:006 He made also ten lavers, and put five on the right hand, and
        five on the left, to wash in them: such things as they offered
        for the burnt offering they washed in them; but the sea was
        for the priests to wash in.

004:007 And he made ten candlesticks of gold according to their form,
        and set them in the temple, five on the right hand, and five
        on the left.

004:008 He made also ten tables, and placed them in the temple, five
        on the right side, and five on the left. And he made an
        hundred basons of gold.

004:009 Furthermore he made the court of the priests, and the great
        court, and doors for the court, and overlaid the doors of them
        with brass.

004:010 And he set the sea on the right side of the east end, over
        against the south.

004:011 And Huram made the pots, and the shovels, and the basons. And
        Huram finished the work that he was to make for king Solomon
        for the house of God;

004:012 To wit, the two pillars, and the pommels, and the chapiters
        which were on the top of the two pillars, and the two wreaths
        to cover the two pommels of the chapiters which were on the
        top of the pillars;

004:013 And four hundred pomegranates on the two wreaths; two rows of
        pomegranates on each wreath, to cover the two pommels of the
        chapiters which were upon the pillars.

004:014 He made also bases, and lavers made he upon the bases;

004:015 One sea, and twelve oxen under it.

004:016 The pots also, and the shovels, and the fleshhooks, and all
        their instruments, did Huram his father make to king Solomon
        for the house of the LORD of bright brass.

004:017 In the plain of Jordan did the king cast them, in the clay
        ground between Succoth and Zeredathah.

004:018 Thus Solomon made all these vessels in great abundance: for
        the weight of the brass could not be found out.

004:019 And Solomon made all the vessels that were for the house of
        God, the golden altar also, and the tables whereon the
        shewbread was set;

004:020 Moreover the candlesticks with their lamps, that they should
        burn after the manner before the oracle, of pure gold;

004:021 And the flowers, and the lamps, and the tongs, made he of
        gold, and that perfect gold;

004:022 And the snuffers, and the basons, and the spoons, and the
        censers, of pure gold: and the entry of the house, the inner
        doors thereof for the most holy place, and the doors of the
        house of the temple, were of gold.

005:001 Thus all the work that Solomon made for the house of the LORD
        was finished: and Solomon brought in all the things that David
        his father had dedicated; and the silver, and the gold, and
        all the instruments, put he among the treasures of the house
        of God.

005:002 Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel, and all the heads
        of the tribes, the chief of the fathers of the children of
        Israel, unto Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the covenant of
        the LORD out of the city of David, which is Zion.

005:003 Wherefore all the men of Israel assembled themselves unto the
        king in the feast which was in the seventh month.

005:004 And all the elders of Israel came; and the Levites took up the
        ark.

005:005 And they brought up the ark, and the tabernacle of the
        congregation, and all the holy vessels that were in the
        tabernacle, these did the priests and the Levites bring up.

005:006 Also king Solomon, and all the congregation of Israel that
        were assembled unto him before the ark, sacrificed sheep and
        oxen, which could not be told nor numbered for multitude.

005:007 And the priests brought in the ark of the covenant of the LORD
        unto his place, to the oracle of the house, into the most holy
        place, even under the wings of the cherubims:

005:008 For the cherubims spread forth their wings over the place of
        the ark, and the cherubims covered the ark and the staves
        thereof above.

005:009 And they drew out the staves of the ark, that the ends of the
        staves were seen from the ark before the oracle; but they were
        not seen without. And there it is unto this day.

005:010 There was nothing in the ark save the two tables which Moses
        put therein at Horeb, when the LORD made a covenant with the
        children of Israel, when they came out of Egypt.

005:011 And it came to pass, when the priests were come out of the
        holy place: (for all the priests that were present were
        sanctified, and did not then wait by course:

005:012 Also the Levites which were the singers, all of them of Asaph,
        of Heman, of Jeduthun, with their sons and their brethren,
        being arrayed in white linen, having cymbals and psalteries
        and harps, stood at the east end of the altar, and with them
        an hundred and twenty priests sounding with trumpets:)

005:013 It came even to pass, as the trumpeters and singers were as
        one, to make one sound to be heard in praising and thanking
        the LORD; and when they lifted up their voice with the
        trumpets and cymbals and instruments of musick, and praised
        the LORD, saying, For he is good; for his mercy endureth for
        ever: that then the house was filled with a cloud, even the
        house of the LORD;

005:014 So that the priests could not stand to minister by reason of
        the cloud: for the glory of the LORD had filled the house of
        God.

006:001 Then said Solomon, The LORD hath said that he would dwell in
        the thick darkness.

006:002 But I have built an house of habitation for thee, and a place
        for thy dwelling for ever.

006:003 And the king turned his face, and blessed the whole
        congregation of Israel: and all the congregation of Israel
        stood.

006:004 And he said, Blessed be the LORD God of Israel, who hath with
        his hands fulfilled that which he spake with his mouth to my
        father David, saying,

006:005 Since the day that I brought forth my people out of the land
        of Egypt I chose no city among all the tribes of Israel to
        build an house in, that my name might be there; neither chose
        I any man to be a ruler over my people Israel:

006:006 But I have chosen Jerusalem, that my name might be there; and
        have chosen David to be over my people Israel.

006:007 Now it was in the heart of David my father to build an house
        for the name of the LORD God of Israel.

006:008 But the LORD said to David my father, Forasmuch as it was in
        thine heart to build an house for my name, thou didst well in
        that it was in thine heart:

006:009 Notwithstanding thou shalt not build the house; but thy son
        which shall come forth out of thy loins, he shall build the
        house for my name.

006:010 The LORD therefore hath performed his word that he hath
        spoken: for I am risen up in the room of David my father, and
        am set on the throne of Israel, as the LORD promised, and have
        built the house for the name of the LORD God of Israel.

006:011 And in it have I put the ark, wherein is the covenant of the
        LORD, that he made with the children of Israel.

006:012 And he stood before the altar of the LORD in the presence of
        all the congregation of Israel, and spread forth his hands:

006:013 For Solomon had made a brasen scaffold of five cubits long,
        and five cubits broad, and three cubits high, and had set it
        in the midst of the court: and upon it he stood, and kneeled
        down upon his knees before all the congregation of Israel, and
        spread forth his hands toward heaven.

006:014 And said, O LORD God of Israel, there is no God like thee in
        the heaven, nor in the earth; which keepest covenant, and
        shewest mercy unto thy servants, that walk before thee with
        all their hearts:

006:015 Thou which hast kept with thy servant David my father that
        which thou hast promised him; and spakest with thy mouth, and
        hast fulfilled it with thine hand, as it is this day.

006:016 Now therefore, O LORD God of Israel, keep with thy servant
        David my father that which thou hast promised him, saying,
        There shall not fail thee a man in my sight to sit upon the
        throne of Israel; yet so that thy children take heed to their
        way to walk in my law, as thou hast walked before me.

006:017 Now then, O LORD God of Israel, let thy word be verified,
        which thou hast spoken unto thy servant David.

006:018 But will God in very deed dwell with men on the earth? behold,
        heaven and the heaven of heavens cannot contain thee; how much
        less this house which I have built!

006:019 Have respect therefore to the prayer of thy servant, and to
        his supplication, O LORD my God, to hearken unto the cry and
        the prayer which thy servant prayeth before thee:

006:020 That thine eyes may be open upon this house day and night,
        upon the place whereof thou hast said that thou wouldest put
        thy name there; to hearken unto the prayer which thy servant
        prayeth toward this place.

006:021 Hearken therefore unto the supplications of thy servant, and
        of thy people Israel, which they shall make toward this place:
        hear thou from thy dwelling place, even from heaven; and when
        thou hearest, forgive.

006:022 If a man sin against his neighbour, and an oath be laid upon
        him to make him swear, and the oath come before thine altar in
        this house;

006:023 Then hear thou from heaven, and do, and judge thy servants, by
        requiting the wicked, by recompensing his way upon his own
        head; and by justifying the righteous, by giving him according
        to his righteousness.

006:024 And if thy people Israel be put to the worse before the enemy,
        because they have sinned against thee; and shall return and
        confess thy name, and pray and make supplication before thee
        in this house;

006:025 Then hear thou from the heavens, and forgive the sin of thy
        people Israel, and bring them again unto the land which thou
        gavest to them and to their fathers.

006:026 When the heaven is shut up, and there is no rain, because they
        have sinned against thee; yet if they pray toward this place,
        and confess thy name, and turn from their sin, when thou dost
        afflict them;

006:027 Then hear thou from heaven, and forgive the sin of thy
        servants, and of thy people Israel, when thou hast taught them
        the good way, wherein they should walk; and send rain upon thy
        land, which thou hast given unto thy people for an
        inheritance.

006:028 If there be dearth in the land, if there be pestilence, if
        there be blasting, or mildew, locusts, or caterpillers; if
        their enemies besiege them in the cities of their land;
        whatsoever sore or whatsoever sickness there be:

006:029 Then what prayer or what supplication soever shall be made of
        any man, or of all thy people Israel, when every one shall
        know his own sore and his own grief, and shall spread forth
        his hands in this house:

006:030 Then hear thou from heaven thy dwelling place, and forgive,
        and render unto every man according unto all his ways, whose
        heart thou knowest; (for thou only knowest the hearts of the
        children of men:)

006:031 That they may fear thee, to walk in thy ways, so long as they
        live in the land which thou gavest unto our fathers.

006:032 Moreover concerning the stranger, which is not of thy people
        Israel, but is come from a far country for thy great name's
        sake, and thy mighty hand, and thy stretched out arm; if they
        come and pray in this house;

006:033 Then hear thou from the heavens, even from thy dwelling place,
        and do according to all that the stranger calleth to thee for;
        that all people of the earth may know thy name, and fear thee,
        as doth thy people Israel, and may know that this house which
        I have built is called by thy name.

006:034 If thy people go out to war against their enemies by the way
        that thou shalt send them, and they pray unto thee toward this
        city which thou hast chosen, and the house which I have built
        for thy name;

006:035 Then hear thou from the heavens their prayer and their
        supplication, and maintain their cause.

006:036 If they sin against thee, (for there is no man which sinneth
        not,) and thou be angry with them, and deliver them over
        before their enemies, and they carry them away captives unto a
        land far off or near;

006:037 Yet if they bethink themselves in the land whither they are
        carried captive, and turn and pray unto thee in the land of
        their captivity, saying, We have sinned, we have done amiss,
        and have dealt wickedly;

006:038 If they return to thee with all their heart and with all their
        soul in the land of their captivity, whither they have carried
        them captives, and pray toward their land, which thou gavest
        unto their fathers, and toward the city which thou hast
        chosen, and toward the house which I have built for thy name:

006:039 Then hear thou from the heavens, even from thy dwelling place,
        their prayer and their supplications, and maintain their
        cause, and forgive thy people which have sinned against thee.

006:040 Now, my God, let, I beseech thee, thine eyes be open, and let
        thine ears be attent unto the prayer that is made in this
        place.

006:041 Now therefore arise, O LORD God, into thy resting place, thou,
        and the ark of thy strength: let thy priests, O LORD God, be
        clothed with salvation, and let thy saints rejoice in
        goodness.

006:042 O LORD God, turn not away the face of thine anointed: remember
        the mercies of David thy servant.

007:001 Now when Solomon had made an end of praying, the fire came
        down from heaven, and consumed the burnt offering and the
        sacrifices; and the glory of the LORD filled the house.

007:002 And the priests could not enter into the house of the LORD,
        because the glory of the LORD had filled the LORD's house.

007:003 And when all the children of Israel saw how the fire came
        down, and the glory of the LORD upon the house, they bowed
        themselves with their faces to the ground upon the pavement,
        and worshipped, and praised the LORD, saying, For he is good;
        for his mercy endureth for ever.

007:004 Then the king and all the people offered sacrifices before the
        LORD.

007:005 And king Solomon offered a sacrifice of twenty and two
        thousand oxen, and an hundred and twenty thousand sheep: so
        the king and all the people dedicated the house of God.

007:006 And the priests waited on their offices: the Levites also with
        instruments of musick of the LORD, which David the king had
        made to praise the LORD, because his mercy endureth for ever,
        when David praised by their ministry; and the priests sounded
        trumpets before them, and all Israel stood.

007:007 Moreover Solomon hallowed the middle of the court that was
        before the house of the LORD: for there he offered burnt
        offerings, and the fat of the peace offerings, because the
        brasen altar which Solomon had made was not able to receive
        the burnt offerings, and the meat offerings, and the fat.

007:008 Also at the same time Solomon kept the feast seven days, and
        all Israel with him, a very great congregation, from the
        entering in of Hamath unto the river of Egypt.

007:009 And in the eighth day they made a solemn assembly: for they
        kept the dedication of the altar seven days, and the feast
        seven days.

007:010 And on the three and twentieth day of the seventh month he
        sent the people away into their tents, glad and merry in heart
        for the goodness that the LORD had shewed unto David, and to
        Solomon, and to Israel his people.

007:011 Thus Solomon finished the house of the LORD, and the king's
        house: and all that came into Solomon's heart to make in the
        house of the LORD, and in his own house, he prosperously
        effected.

007:012 And the LORD appeared to Solomon by night, and said unto him,
        I have heard thy prayer, and have chosen this place to myself
        for an house of sacrifice.

007:013 If I shut up heaven that there be no rain, or if I command the
        locusts to devour the land, or if I send pestilence among my
        people;

007:014 If my people, which are called by my name, shall humble
        themselves, and pray, and seek my face, and turn from their
        wicked ways; then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive
        their sin, and will heal their land.

007:015 Now mine eyes shall be open, and mine ears attent unto the
        prayer that is made in this place.

007:016 For now have I chosen and sanctified this house, that my name
        may be there for ever: and mine eyes and mine heart shall be
        there perpetually.

007:017 And as for thee, if thou wilt walk before me, as David thy
        father walked, and do according to all that I have commanded
        thee, and shalt observe my statutes and my judgments;

007:018 Then will I stablish the throne of thy kingdom, according as I
        have covenanted with David thy father, saying, There shall not
        fail thee a man to be ruler in Israel.

007:019 But if ye turn away, and forsake my statutes and my
        commandments, which I have set before you, and shall go and
        serve other gods, and worship them;

007:020 Then will I pluck them up by the roots out of my land which I
        have given them; and this house, which I have sanctified for
        my name, will I cast out of my sight, and will make it to be a
        proverb and a byword among all nations.

007:021 And this house, which is high, shall be an astonishment to
        every one that passeth by it; so that he shall say, Why hath
        the LORD done thus unto this land, and unto this house?

007:022 And it shall be answered, Because they forsook the LORD God of
        their fathers, which brought them forth out of the land of
        Egypt, and laid hold on other gods, and worshipped them, and
        served them: therefore hath he brought all this evil upon
        them.

008:001 And it came to pass at the end of twenty years, wherein
        Solomon had built the house of the LORD, and his own house,

008:002 That the cities which Huram had restored to Solomon, Solomon
        built them, and caused the children of Israel to dwell there.

008:003 And Solomon went to Hamathzobah, and prevailed against it.

008:004 And he built Tadmor in the wilderness, and all the store
        cities, which he built in Hamath.

008:005 Also he built Bethhoron the upper, and Bethhoron the nether,
        fenced cities, with walls, gates, and bars;

008:006 And Baalath, and all the store cities that Solomon had, and
        all the chariot cities, and the cities of the horsemen, and
        all that Solomon desired to build in Jerusalem, and in
        Lebanon, and throughout all the land of his dominion.

008:007 As for all the people that were left of the Hittites, and the
        Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Hivites, and the
        Jebusites, which were not of Israel,

008:008 But of their children, who were left after them in the land,
        whom the children of Israel consumed not, them did Solomon
        make to pay tribute until this day.

008:009 But of the children of Israel did Solomon make no servants for
        his work; but they were men of war, and chief of his captains,
        and captains of his chariots and horsemen.

008:010 And these were the chief of king Solomon's officers, even two
        hundred and fifty, that bare rule over the people.

008:011 And Solomon brought up the daughter of Pharaoh out of the city
        of David unto the house that he had built for her: for he
        said, My wife shall not dwell in the house of David king of
        Israel, because the places are holy, whereunto the ark of the
        LORD hath come.

008:012 Then Solomon offered burnt offerings unto the LORD on the
        altar of the LORD, which he had built before the porch,

008:013 Even after a certain rate every day, offering according to the
        commandment of Moses, on the sabbaths, and on the new moons,
        and on the solemn feasts, three times in the year, even in the
        feast of unleavened bread, and in the feast of weeks, and in
        the feast of tabernacles.

008:014 And he appointed, according to the order of David his father,
        the courses of the priests to their service, and the Levites
        to their charges, to praise and minister before the priests,
        as the duty of every day required: the porters also by their
        courses at every gate: for so had David the man of God
        commanded.

008:015 And they departed not from the commandment of the king unto
        the priests and Levites concerning any matter, or concerning
        the treasures.

008:016 Now all the work of Solomon was prepared unto the day of the
        foundation of the house of the LORD, and until it was
        finished. So the house of the LORD was perfected.

008:017 Then went Solomon to Eziongeber, and to Eloth, at the sea side
        in the land of Edom.

008:018 And Huram sent him by the hands of his servants ships, and
        servants that had knowledge of the sea; and they went with the
        servants of Solomon to Ophir, and took thence four hundred and
        fifty talents of gold, and brought them to king Solomon.

009:001 And when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon, she
        came to prove Solomon with hard questions at Jerusalem, with a
        very great company, and camels that bare spices, and gold in
        abundance, and precious stones: and when she was come to
        Solomon, she communed with him of all that was in her heart.

009:002 And Solomon told her all her questions: and there was nothing
        hid from Solomon which he told her not.

009:003 And when the queen of Sheba had seen the wisdom of Solomon,
        and the house that he had built,

009:004 And the meat of his table, and the sitting of his servants,
        and the attendance of his ministers, and their apparel; his
        cupbearers also, and their apparel; and his ascent by which he
        went up into the house of the LORD; there was no more spirit
        in her.

009:005 And she said to the king, It was a true report which I heard
        in mine own land of thine acts, and of thy wisdom:

009:006 Howbeit I believed not their words, until I came, and mine
        eyes had seen it: and, behold, the one half of the greatness
        of thy wisdom was not told me: for thou exceedest the fame
        that I heard.

009:007 Happy are thy men, and happy are these thy servants, which
        stand continually before thee, and hear thy wisdom.

009:008 Blessed be the LORD thy God, which delighted in thee to set
        thee on his throne, to be king for the LORD thy God: because
        thy God loved Israel, to establish them for ever, therefore
        made he thee king over them, to do judgment and justice.

009:009 And she gave the king an hundred and twenty talents of gold,
        and of spices great abundance, and precious stones: neither
        was there any such spice as the queen of Sheba gave king
        Solomon.

009:010 And the servants also of Huram, and the servants of Solomon,
        which brought gold from Ophir, brought algum trees and
        precious stones.

009:011 And the king made of the algum trees terraces to the house of
        the LORD, and to the king's palace, and harps and psalteries
        for singers: and there were none such seen before in the land
        of Judah.

009:012 And king Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all her desire,
        whatsoever she asked, beside that which she had brought unto
        the king. So she turned, and went away to her own land, she
        and her servants.

009:013 Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was
        six hundred and threescore and six talents of gold;

009:014 Beside that which chapmen and merchants brought. And all the
        kings of Arabia and governors of the country brought gold and
        silver to Solomon.

009:015 And king Solomon made two hundred targets of beaten gold: six
        hundred shekels of beaten gold went to one target.

009:016 And three hundred shields made he of beaten gold: three
        hundred shekels of gold went to one shield. And the king put
        them in the house of the forest of Lebanon.

009:017 Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid
        it with pure gold.

009:018 And there were six steps to the throne, with a footstool of
        gold, which were fastened to the throne, and stays on each
        side of the sitting place, and two lions standing by the
        stays:

009:019 And twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other
        upon the six steps. There was not the like made in any
        kingdom.

009:020 And all the drinking vessels of king Solomon were of gold, and
        all the vessels of the house of the forest of Lebanon were of
        pure gold: none were of silver; it was not any thing accounted
        of in the days of Solomon.

009:021 For the king's ships went to Tarshish with the servants of
        Huram: every three years once came the ships of Tarshish
        bringing gold, and silver, ivory, and apes, and peacocks.

009:022 And king Solomon passed all the kings of the earth in riches
        and wisdom.

009:023 And all the kings of the earth sought the presence of Solomon,
        to hear his wisdom, that God had put in his heart.

009:024 And they brought every man his present, vessels of silver, and
        vessels of gold, and raiment, harness, and spices, horses, and
        mules, a rate year by year.

009:025 And Solomon had four thousand stalls for horses and chariots,
        and twelve thousand horsemen; whom he bestowed in the chariot
        cities, and with the king at Jerusalem.

009:026 And he reigned over all the kings from the river even unto the
        land of the Philistines, and to the border of Egypt.

009:027 And the king made silver in Jerusalem as stones, and cedar
        trees made he as the sycomore trees that are in the low plains
        in abundance.

009:028 And they brought unto Solomon horses out of Egypt, and out of
        all lands.

009:029 Now the rest of the acts of Solomon, first and last, are they
        not written in the book of Nathan the prophet, and in the
        prophecy of Ahijah the Shilonite, and in the visions of Iddo
        the seer against Jeroboam the son of Nebat?

009:030 And Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel forty years.

009:031 And Solomon slept with his fathers, and he was buried in the
        city of David his father: and Rehoboam his son reigned in his
        stead.

010:001 And Rehoboam went to Shechem: for to Shechem were all Israel
        come to make him king.

010:002 And it came to pass, when Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who was
        in Egypt, whither he fled from the presence of Solomon the
        king, heard it, that Jeroboam returned out of Egypt.

010:003 And they sent and called him. So Jeroboam and all Israel came
        and spake to Rehoboam, saying,

010:004 Thy father made our yoke grievous: now therefore ease thou
        somewhat the grievous servitude of thy father, and his heavy
        yoke that he put upon us, and we will serve thee.

010:005 And he said unto them, Come again unto me after three days.
        And the people departed.

010:006 And king Rehoboam took counsel with the old men that had stood
        before Solomon his father while he yet lived, saying, What
        counsel give ye me to return answer to this people?

010:007 And they spake unto him, saying, If thou be kind to this
        people, and please them, and speak good words to them, they
        will be thy servants for ever.

010:008 But he forsook the counsel which the old men gave him, and
        took counsel with the young men that were brought up with him,
        that stood before him.

010:009 And he said unto them, What advice give ye that we may return
        answer to this people, which have spoken to me, saying, Ease
        somewhat the yoke that thy father did put upon us?

010:010 And the young men that were brought up with him spake unto
        him, saying, Thus shalt thou answer the people that spake unto
        thee, saying, Thy father made our yoke heavy, but make thou it
        somewhat lighter for us; thus shalt thou say unto them, My
        little finger shall be thicker than my father's loins.

010:011 For whereas my father put a heavy yoke upon you, I will put
        more to your yoke: my father chastised you with whips, but I
        will chastise you with scorpions.

010:012 So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam on the third
        day, as the king bade, saying, Come again to me on the third
        day.

010:013 And the king answered them roughly; and king Rehoboam forsook
        the counsel of the old men,

010:014 And answered them after the advice of the young men, saying,
        My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add thereto: my
        father chastised you with whips, but I will chastise you with
        scorpions.

010:015 So the king hearkened not unto the people: for the cause was
        of God, that the LORD might perform his word, which he spake
        by the hand of Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of
        Nebat.

010:016 And when all Israel saw that the king would not hearken unto
        them, the people answered the king, saying, What portion have
        we in David? and we have none inheritance in the son of Jesse:
        every man to your tents, O Israel: and now, David, see to
        thine own house. So all Israel went to their tents.

010:017 But as for the children of Israel that dwelt in the cities of
        Judah, Rehoboam reigned over them.

010:018 Then king Rehoboam sent Hadoram that was over the tribute; and
        the children of Israel stoned him with stones, that he died.
        But king Rehoboam made speed to get him up to his chariot, to
        flee to Jerusalem.

010:019 And Israel rebelled against the house of David unto this day.

011:001 And when Rehoboam was come to Jerusalem, he gathered of the
        house of Judah and Benjamin an hundred and fourscore thousand
        chosen men, which were warriors, to fight against Israel, that
        he might bring the kingdom again to Rehoboam.

011:002 But the word of the LORD came to Shemaiah the man of God,
        saying,

011:003 Speak unto Rehoboam the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and to
        all Israel in Judah and Benjamin, saying,

011:004 Thus saith the LORD, Ye shall not go up, nor fight against
        your brethren: return every man to his house: for this thing
        is done of me. And they obeyed the words of the LORD, and
        returned from going against Jeroboam.

011:005 And Rehoboam dwelt in Jerusalem, and built cities for defence
        in Judah.

011:006 He built even Bethlehem, and Etam, and Tekoa,

011:007 And Bethzur, and Shoco, and Adullam,

011:008 And Gath, and Mareshah, and Ziph,

011:009 And Adoraim, and Lachish, and Azekah,

011:010 And Zorah, and Aijalon, and Hebron, which are in Judah and in
        Benjamin fenced cities.

011:011 And he fortified the strong holds, and put captains in them,
        and store of victual, and of oil and wine.

011:012 And in every several city he put shields and spears, and made
        them exceeding strong, having Judah and Benjamin on his side.

011:013 And the priests and the Levites that were in all Israel
        resorted to him out of all their coasts.

011:014 For the Levites left their suburbs and their possession, and
        came to Judah and Jerusalem: for Jeroboam and his sons had
        cast them off from executing the priest's office unto the
        LORD:

011:015 And he ordained him priests for the high places, and for the
        devils, and for the calves which he had made.

011:016 And after them out of all the tribes of Israel such as set
        their hearts to seek the LORD God of Israel came to Jerusalem,
        to sacrifice unto the LORD God of their fathers.

011:017 So they strengthened the kingdom of Judah, and made Rehoboam
        the son of Solomon strong, three years: for three years they
        walked in the way of David and Solomon.

011:018 And Rehoboam took him Mahalath the daughter of Jerimoth the
        son of David to wife, and Abihail the daughter of Eliab the
        son of Jesse;

011:019 Which bare him children; Jeush, and Shamariah, and Zaham.

011:020 And after her he took Maachah the daughter of Absalom; which
        bare him Abijah, and Attai, and Ziza, and Shelomith.

011:021 And Rehoboam loved Maachah the daughter of Absalom above all
        his wives and his concubines: (for he took eighteen wives, and
        threescore concubines; and begat twenty and eight sons, and
        threescore daughters.)

011:022 And Rehoboam made Abijah the son of Maachah the chief, to be
        ruler among his brethren: for he thought to make him king.

011:023 And he dealt wisely, and dispersed of all his children
        throughout all the countries of Judah and Benjamin, unto every
        fenced city: and he gave them victual in abundance. And he
        desired many wives.

012:001 And it came to pass, when Rehoboam had established the
        kingdom, and had strengthened himself, he forsook the law of
        the LORD, and all Israel with him.

012:002 And it came to pass, that in the fifth year of king Rehoboam
        Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, because they
        had transgressed against the LORD,

012:003 With twelve hundred chariots, and threescore thousand
        horsemen: and the people were without number that came with
        him out of Egypt; the Lubims, the Sukkiims, and the
        Ethiopians.

012:004 And he took the fenced cities which pertained to Judah, and
        came to Jerusalem.

012:005 Then came Shemaiah the prophet to Rehoboam, and to the princes
        of Judah, that were gathered together to Jerusalem because of
        Shishak, and said unto them, Thus saith the LORD, Ye have
        forsaken me, and therefore have I also left you in the hand of
        Shishak.

012:006 Whereupon the princes of Israel and the king humbled
        themselves; and they said, The LORD is righteous.

012:007 And when the LORD saw that they humbled themselves, the word
        of the LORD came to Shemaiah, saying, They have humbled
        themselves; therefore I will not destroy them, but I will
        grant them some deliverance; and my wrath shall not be poured
        out upon Jerusalem by the hand of Shishak.

012:008 Nevertheless they shall be his servants; that they may know my
        service, and the service of the kingdoms of the countries.

012:009 So Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem, and took
        away the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures
        of the king's house; he took all: he carried away also the
        shields of gold which Solomon had made.

012:010 Instead of which king Rehoboam made shields of brass, and
        committed them to the hands of the chief of the guard, that
        kept the entrance of the king's house.

012:011 And when the king entered into the house of the LORD, the
        guard came and fetched them, and brought them again into the
        guard chamber.

012:012 And when he humbled himself, the wrath of the LORD turned from
        him, that he would not destroy him altogether: and also in
        Judah things went well.

012:013 So king Rehoboam strengthened himself in Jerusalem, and
        reigned: for Rehoboam was one and forty years old when he
        began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem,
        the city which the LORD had chosen out of all the tribes of
        Israel, to put his name there. And his mother's name was
        Naamah an Ammonitess.

012:014 And he did evil, because he prepared not his heart to seek the
        LORD.

012:015 Now the acts of Rehoboam, first and last, are they not written
        in the book of Shemaiah the prophet, and of Iddo the seer
        concerning genealogies? And there were wars between Rehoboam
        and Jeroboam continually.

012:016 And Rehoboam slept with his fathers, and was buried in the
        city of David: and Abijah his son reigned in his stead.

013:001 Now in the eighteenth year of king Jeroboam began Abijah to
        reign over Judah.

013:002 He reigned three years in Jerusalem. His mother's name also
        was Michaiah the daughter of Uriel of Gibeah. And there was
        war between Abijah and Jeroboam.

013:003 And Abijah set the battle in array with an army of valiant men
        of war, even four hundred thousand chosen men: Jeroboam also
        set the battle in array against him with eight hundred
        thousand chosen men, being mighty men of valour.

013:004 And Abijah stood up upon mount Zemaraim, which is in mount
        Ephraim, and said, Hear me, thou Jeroboam, and all Israel;

013:005 Ought ye not to know that the LORD God of Israel gave the
        kingdom over Israel to David for ever, even to him and to his
        sons by a covenant of salt?

013:006 Yet Jeroboam the son of Nebat, the servant of Solomon the son
        of David, is risen up, and hath rebelled against his lord.

013:007 And there are gathered unto him vain men, the children of
        Belial, and have strengthened themselves against Rehoboam the
        son of Solomon, when Rehoboam was young and tenderhearted, and
        could not withstand them.

013:008 And now ye think to withstand the kingdom of the LORD in the
        hand of the sons of David; and ye be a great multitude, and
        there are with your golden calves, which Jeroboam made you for
        gods.

013:009 Have ye not cast out the priests of the LORD, the sons of
        Aaron, and the Levites, and have made you priests after the
        manner of the nations of other lands? so that whosoever cometh
        to consecrate himself with a young bullock and seven rams, the
        same may be a priest of them that are no gods.

013:010 But as for us, the LORD is our God, and we have not forsaken
        him; and the priests, which minister unto the LORD, are the
        sons of Aaron, and the Levites wait upon their business:

013:011 And they burn unto the LORD every morning and every evening
        burnt sacrifices and sweet incense: the shewbread also set
        they in order upon the pure table; and the candlestick of gold
        with the lamps thereof, to burn every evening: for we keep the
        charge of the LORD our God; but ye have forsaken him.

013:012 And, behold, God himself is with us for our captain, and his
        priests with sounding trumpets to cry alarm against you. O
        children of Israel, fight ye not against the LORD God of your
        fathers; for ye shall not prosper.

013:013 But Jeroboam caused an ambushment to come about behind them:
        so they were before Judah, and the ambushment was behind them.

013:014 And when Judah looked back, behold, the battle was before and
        behind: and they cried unto the LORD, and the priests sounded
        with the trumpets.

013:015 Then the men of Judah gave a shout: and as the men of Judah
        shouted, it came to pass, that God smote Jeroboam and all
        Israel before Abijah and Judah.

013:016 And the children of Israel fled before Judah: and God
        delivered them into their hand.

013:017 And Abijah and his people slew them with a great slaughter: so
        there fell down slain of Israel five hundred thousand chosen
        men.

013:018 Thus the children of Israel were brought under at that time,
        and the children of Judah prevailed, because they relied upon
        the LORD God of their fathers.

013:019 And Abijah pursued after Jeroboam, and took cities from him,
        Bethel with the towns thereof, and Jeshanah with the towns
        thereof, and Ephraim with the towns thereof.

013:020 Neither did Jeroboam recover strength again in the days of
        Abijah: and the LORD struck him, and he died.

013:021 But Abijah waxed mighty, and married fourteen wives, and begat
        twenty and two sons, and sixteen daughters.

013:022 And the rest of the acts of Abijah, and his ways, and his
        sayings, are written in the story of the prophet Iddo.

014:001 So Abijah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the
        city of David: and Asa his son reigned in his stead. In his
        days the land was quiet ten years.

014:002 And Asa did that which was good and right in the eyes of the
        LORD his God:

014:003 For he took away the altars of the strange gods, and the high
        places, and brake down the images, and cut down the groves:

014:004 And commanded Judah to seek the LORD God of their fathers, and
        to do the law and the commandment.

014:005 Also he took away out of all the cities of Judah the high
        places and the images: and the kingdom was quiet before him.

014:006 And he built fenced cities in Judah: for the land had rest,
        and he had no war in those years; because the LORD had given
        him rest.

014:007 Therefore he said unto Judah, Let us build these cities, and
        make about them walls, and towers, gates, and bars, while the
        land is yet before us; because we have sought the LORD our
        God, we have sought him, and he hath given us rest on every
        side. So they built and prospered.

014:008 And Asa had an army of men that bare targets and spears, out
        of Judah three hundred thousand; and out of Benjamin, that
        bare shields and drew bows, two hundred and fourscore
        thousand: all these were mighty men of valour.

014:009 And there came out against them Zerah the Ethiopian with an
        host of a thousand thousand, and three hundred chariots; and
        came unto Mareshah.

014:010 Then Asa went out against him, and they set the battle in
        array in the valley of Zephathah at Mareshah.

014:011 And Asa cried unto the LORD his God, and said, LORD, it is
        nothing with thee to help, whether with many, or with them
        that have no power: help us, O LORD our God; for we rest on
        thee, and in thy name we go against this multitude. O LORD,
        thou art our God; let no man prevail against thee.

014:012 So the LORD smote the Ethiopians before Asa, and before Judah;
        and the Ethiopians fled.

014:013 And Asa and the people that were with him pursued them unto
        Gerar: and the Ethiopians were overthrown, that they could not
        recover themselves; for they were destroyed before the LORD,
        and before his host; and they carried away very much spoil.

014:014 And they smote all the cities round about Gerar; for the fear
        of the LORD came upon them: and they spoiled all the cities;
        for there was exceeding much spoil in them.

014:015 They smote also the tents of cattle, and carried away sheep
        and camels in abundance, and returned to Jerusalem.

015:001 And the Spirit of God came upon Azariah the son of Oded:

015:002 And he went out to meet Asa, and said unto him, Hear ye me,
        Asa, and all Judah and Benjamin; The LORD is with you, while
        ye be with him; and if ye seek him, he will be found of you;
        but if ye forsake him, he will forsake you.

015:003 Now for a long season Israel hath been without the true God,
        and without a teaching priest, and without law.

015:004 But when they in their trouble did turn unto the LORD God of
        Israel, and sought him, he was found of them.

015:005 And in those times there was no peace to him that went out,
        nor to him that came in, but great vexations were upon all the
        inhabitants of the countries.

015:006 And nation was destroyed of nation, and city of city: for God
        did vex them with all adversity.

015:007 Be ye strong therefore, and let not your hands be weak: for
        your work shall be rewarded.

015:008 And when Asa heard these words, and the prophecy of Oded the
        prophet, he took courage, and put away the abominable idols
        out of all the land of Judah and Benjamin, and out of the
        cities which he had taken from mount Ephraim, and renewed the
        altar of the LORD, that was before the porch of the LORD.

015:009 And he gathered all Judah and Benjamin, and the strangers with
        them out of Ephraim and Manasseh, and out of Simeon: for they
        fell to him out of Israel in abundance, when they saw that the
        LORD his God was with him.

015:010 So they gathered themselves together at Jerusalem in the third
        month, in the fifteenth year of the reign of Asa.

015:011 And they offered unto the LORD the same time, of the spoil
        which they had brought, seven hundred oxen and seven thousand
        sheep.

015:012 And they entered into a covenant to seek the LORD God of their
        fathers with all their heart and with all their soul;

015:013 That whosoever would not seek the LORD God of Israel should be
        put to death, whether small or great, whether man or woman.

015:014 And they sware unto the LORD with a loud voice, and with
        shouting, and with trumpets, and with cornets.

015:015 And all Judah rejoiced at the oath: for they had sworn with
        all their heart, and sought him with their whole desire; and
        he was found of them: and the LORD gave them rest round about.

015:016 And also concerning Maachah the mother of Asa the king, he
        removed her from being queen, because she had made an idol in
        a grove: and Asa cut down her idol, and stamped it, and burnt
        it at the brook Kidron.

015:017 But the high places were not taken away out of Israel:
        nevertheless the heart of Asa was perfect all his days.

015:018 And he brought into the house of God the things that his
        father had dedicated, and that he himself had dedicated,
        silver, and gold, and vessels.

015:019 And there was no more war unto the five and thirtieth year of
        the reign of Asa.

016:001 In the six and thirtieth year of the reign of Asa Baasha king
        of Israel came up against Judah, and built Ramah, to the
        intent that he might let none go out or come in to Asa king of
        Judah.

016:002 Then Asa brought out silver and gold out of the treasures of
        the house of the LORD and of the king's house, and sent to
        Benhadad king of Syria, that dwelt at Damascus, saying,

016:003 There is a league between me and thee, as there was between my
        father and thy father: behold, I have sent thee silver and
        gold; go, break thy league with Baasha king of Israel, that he
        may depart from me.

016:004 And Benhadad hearkened unto king Asa, and sent the captains of
        his armies against the cities of Israel; and they smote Ijon,
        and Dan, and Abelmaim, and all the store cities of Naphtali.

016:005 And it came to pass, when Baasha heard it, that he left off
        building of Ramah, and let his work cease.

016:006 Then Asa the king took all Judah; and they carried away the
        stones of Ramah, and the timber thereof, wherewith Baasha was
        building; and he built therewith Geba and Mizpah.

016:007 And at that time Hanani the seer came to Asa king of Judah,
        and said unto him, Because thou hast relied on the king of
        Syria, and not relied on the LORD thy God, therefore is the
        host of the king of Syria escaped out of thine hand.

016:008 Were not the Ethiopians and the Lubims a huge host, with very
        many chariots and horsemen? yet, because thou didst rely on
        the LORD, he delivered them into thine hand.

016:009 For the eyes of the LORD run to and fro throughout the whole
        earth, to shew himself strong in the behalf of them whose
        heart is perfect toward him. Herein thou hast done foolishly:
        therefore from henceforth thou shalt have wars.

016:010 Then Asa was wroth with the seer, and put him in a prison
        house; for he was in a rage with him because of this thing.
        And Asa oppressed some of the people the same time.

016:011 And, behold, the acts of Asa, first and last, lo, they are
        written in the book of the kings of Judah and Israel.

016:012 And Asa in the thirty and ninth year of his reign was diseased
        in his feet, until his disease was exceeding great: yet in his
        disease he sought not to the LORD, but to the physicians.

016:013 And Asa slept with his fathers, and died in the one and
        fortieth year of his reign.

016:014 And they buried him in his own sepulchres, which he had made
        for himself in the city of David, and laid him in the bed
        which was filled with sweet odours and divers kinds of spices
        prepared by the apothecaries' art: and they made a very great
        burning for him.

017:001 And Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his stead, and strengthened
        himself against Israel.

017:002 And he placed forces in all the fenced cities of Judah, and
        set garrisons in the land of Judah, and in the cities of
        Ephraim, which Asa his father had taken.

017:003 And the LORD was with Jehoshaphat, because he walked in the
        first ways of his father David, and sought not unto Baalim;

017:004 But sought to the Lord God of his father, and walked in his
        commandments, and not after the doings of Israel.

017:005 Therefore the LORD stablished the kingdom in his hand; and all
        Judah brought to Jehoshaphat presents; and he had riches and
        honour in abundance.

017:006 And his heart was lifted up in the ways of the LORD: moreover
        he took away the high places and groves out of Judah.

017:007 Also in the third year of his reign he sent to his princes,
        even to Benhail, and to Obadiah, and to Zechariah, and to
        Nethaneel, and to Michaiah, to teach in the cities of Judah.

017:008 And with them he sent Levites, even Shemaiah, and Nethaniah,
        and Zebadiah, and Asahel, and Shemiramoth, and Jehonathan, and
        Adonijah, and Tobijah, and Tobadonijah, Levites; and with them
        Elishama and Jehoram, priests.

017:009 And they taught in Judah, and had the book of the law of the
        LORD with them, and went about throughout all the cities of
        Judah, and taught the people.

017:010 And the fear of the LORD fell upon all the kingdoms of the
        lands that were round about Judah, so that they made no war
        against Jehoshaphat.

017:011 Also some of the Philistines brought Jehoshaphat presents, and
        tribute silver; and the Arabians brought him flocks, seven
        thousand and seven hundred rams, and seven thousand and seven
        hundred he goats.

017:012 And Jehoshaphat waxed great exceedingly; and he built in Judah
        castles, and cities of store.

017:013 And he had much business in the cities of Judah: and the men
        of war, mighty men of valour, were in Jerusalem.

017:014 And these are the numbers of them according to the house of
        their fathers: Of Judah, the captains of thousands; Adnah the
        chief, and with him mighty men of valour three hundred
        thousand.

017:015 And next to him was Jehohanan the captain, and with him two
        hundred and fourscore thousand.

017:016 And next him was Amasiah the son of Zichri, who willingly
        offered himself unto the LORD; and with him two hundred
        thousand mighty men of valour.

017:017 And of Benjamin; Eliada a mighty man of valour, and with him
        armed men with bow and shield two hundred thousand.

017:018 And next him was Jehozabad, and with him an hundred and
        fourscore thousand ready prepared for the war.

017:019 These waited on the king, beside those whom the king put in
        the fenced cities throughout all Judah.

018:001 Now Jehoshaphat had riches and honour in abundance, and joined
        affinity with Ahab.

018:002 And after certain years he went down to Ahab to Samaria. And
        Ahab killed sheep and oxen for him in abundance, and for the
        people that he had with him, and persuaded him to go up with
        him to Ramothgilead.

018:003 And Ahab king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat king of Judah,
        Wilt thou go with me to Ramothgilead? And he answered him, I
        am as thou art, and my people as thy people; and we will be
        with thee in the war.

018:004 And Jehoshaphat said unto the king of Israel, Enquire, I pray
        thee, at the word of the LORD to day.

018:005 Therefore the king of Israel gathered together of prophets
        four hundred men, and said unto them, Shall we go to
        Ramothgilead to battle, or shall I forbear? And they said, Go
        up; for God will deliver it into the king's hand.

018:006 But Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here a prophet of the LORD
        besides, that we might enquire of him?

018:007 And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, There is yet one
        man, by whom we may enquire of the LORD: but I hate him; for
        he never prophesied good unto me, but always evil: the same is
        Micaiah the son of Imla. And Jehoshaphat said, Let not the
        king say so.

018:008 And the king of Israel called for one of his officers, and
        said, Fetch quickly Micaiah the son of Imla.

018:009 And the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat king of Judah sat
        either of them on his throne, clothed in their robes, and they
        sat in a void place at the entering in of the gate of Samaria;
        and all the prophets prophesied before them.

018:010 And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah had made him horns of iron,
        and said, Thus saith the LORD, With these thou shalt push
        Syria until they be consumed.

018:011 And all the prophets prophesied so, saying, Go up to
        Ramothgilead, and prosper: for the LORD shall deliver it into
        the hand of the king.

018:012 And the messenger that went to call Micaiah spake to him,
        saying, Behold, the words of the prophets declare good to the
        king with one assent; let thy word therefore, I pray thee, be
        like one of their's, and speak thou good.

018:013 And Micaiah said, As the LORD liveth, even what my God saith,
        that will I speak.

018:014 And when he was come to the king, the king said unto him,
        Micaiah, shall we go to Ramothgilead to battle, or shall I
        forbear? And he said, Go ye up, and prosper, and they shall be
        delivered into your hand.

018:015 And the king said to him, How many times shall I adjure thee
        that thou say nothing but the truth to me in the name of the
        LORD?

018:016 Then he said, I did see all Israel scattered upon the
        mountains, as sheep that have no shepherd: and the LORD said,
        These have no master; let them return therefore every man to
        his house in peace.

018:017 And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, Did I not tell
        thee that he would not prophesy good unto me, but evil?

018:018 Again he said, Therefore hear the word of the LORD; I saw the
        LORD sitting upon his throne, and all the host of heaven
        standing on his right hand and on his left.

018:019 And the LORD said, Who shall entice Ahab king of Israel, that
        he may go up and fall at Ramothgilead? And one spake saying
        after this manner, and another saying after that manner.

018:020 Then there came out a spirit, and stood before the LORD, and
        said, I will entice him. And the LORD said unto him,
        Wherewith?

018:021 And he said, I will go out, and be a lying spirit in the mouth
        of all his prophets. And the Lord said, Thou shalt entice him,
        and thou shalt also prevail: go out, and do even so.

018:022 Now therefore, behold, the LORD hath put a lying spirit in the
        mouth of these thy prophets, and the LORD hath spoken evil
        against thee.

018:023 Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah came near, and smote
        Micaiah upon the cheek, and said, Which way went the Spirit of
        the LORD from me to speak unto thee?

018:024 And Micaiah said, Behold, thou shalt see on that day when thou
        shalt go into an inner chamber to hide thyself.

018:025 Then the king of Israel said, Take ye Micaiah, and carry him
        back to Amon the governor of the city, and to Joash the king's
        son;

018:026 And say, Thus saith the king, Put this fellow in the prison,
        and feed him with bread of affliction and with water of
        affliction, until I return in peace.

018:027 And Micaiah said, If thou certainly return in peace, then hath
        not the LORD spoken by me. And he said, Hearken, all ye
        people.

018:028 So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went
        up to Ramothgilead.

018:029 And the king of Israel said unto Jehoshaphat, I will disguise
        myself, and I will go to the battle; but put thou on thy
        robes. So the king of Israel disguised himself; and they went
        to the battle.

018:030 Now the king of Syria had commanded the captains of the
        chariots that were with him, saying, Fight ye not with small
        or great, save only with the king of Israel.

018:031 And it came to pass, when the captains of the chariots saw
        Jehoshaphat, that they said, It is the king of Israel.
        Therefore they compassed about him to fight: but Jehoshaphat
        cried out, and the LORD helped him; and God moved them to
        depart from him.

018:032 For it came to pass, that, when the captains of the chariots
        perceived that it was not the king of Israel, they turned back
        again from pursuing him.

018:033 And a certain man drew a bow at a venture, and smote the king
        of Israel between the joints of the harness: therefore he said
        to his chariot man, Turn thine hand, that thou mayest carry me
        out of the host; for I am wounded.

018:034 And the battle increased that day: howbeit the king of Israel
        stayed himself up in his chariot against the Syrians until the
        even: and about the time of the sun going down he died.

019:001 And Jehoshaphat the king of Judah returned to his house in
        peace to Jerusalem.

019:002 And Jehu the son of Hanani the seer went out to meet him, and
        said to king Jehoshaphat, Shouldest thou help the ungodly, and
        love them that hate the LORD? therefore is wrath upon thee
        from before the LORD.

019:003 Nevertheless there are good things found in thee, in that thou
        hast taken away the groves out of the land, and hast prepared
        thine heart to seek God.

019:004 And Jehoshaphat dwelt at Jerusalem: and he went out again
        through the people from Beersheba to mount Ephraim, and
        brought them back unto the LORD God of their fathers.

019:005 And he set judges in the land throughout all the fenced cities
        of Judah, city by city,

019:006 And said to the judges, Take heed what ye do: for ye judge not
        for man, but for the LORD, who is with you in the judgment.

019:007 Wherefore now let the fear of the LORD be upon you; take heed
        and do it: for there is no iniquity with the LORD our God, nor
        respect of persons, nor taking of gifts.

019:008 Moreover in Jerusalem did Jehoshaphat set of the Levites, and
        of the priests, and of the chief of the fathers of Israel, for
        the judgment of the LORD, and for controversies, when they
        returned to Jerusalem.

019:009 And he charged them, saying, Thus shall ye do in the fear of
        the LORD, faithfully, and with a perfect heart.

019:010 And what cause soever shall come to you of your brethren that
        dwell in your cities, between blood and blood, between law and
        commandment, statutes and judgments, ye shall even warn them
        that they trespass not against the LORD, and so wrath come
        upon you, and upon your brethren: this do, and ye shall not
        trespass.

019:011 And, behold, Amariah the chief priest is over you in all
        matters of the LORD; and Zebadiah the son of Ishmael, the
        ruler of the house of Judah, for all the king's matters: also
        the Levites shall be officers before you. Deal courageously,
        and the LORD shall be with the good.

020:001 It came to pass after this also, that the children of Moab,
        and the children of Ammon, and with them other beside the
        Ammonites, came against Jehoshaphat to battle.

020:002 Then there came some that told Jehoshaphat, saying, There
        cometh a great multitude against thee from beyond the sea on
        this side Syria; and, behold, they be in Hazazontamar, which
        is Engedi.

020:003 And Jehoshaphat feared, and set himself to seek the LORD, and
        proclaimed a fast throughout all Judah.

020:004 And Judah gathered themselves together, to ask help of the
        LORD: even out of all the cities of Judah they came to seek
        the LORD.

020:005 And Jehoshaphat stood in the congregation of Judah and
        Jerusalem, in the house of the LORD, before the new court,

020:006 And said, O LORD God of our fathers, art not thou God in
        heaven? and rulest not thou over all the kingdoms of the
        heathen? and in thine hand is there not power and might, so
        that none is able to withstand thee?

020:007 Art not thou our God, who didst drive out the inhabitants of
        this land before thy people Israel, and gavest it to the seed
        of Abraham thy friend for ever?

020:008 And they dwelt therein, and have built thee a sanctuary
        therein for thy name, saying,

020:009 If, when evil cometh upon us, as the sword, judgment, or
        pestilence, or famine, we stand before this house, and in thy
        presence, (for thy name is in this house,) and cry unto thee
        in our affliction, then thou wilt hear and help.

020:010 And now, behold, the children of Ammon and Moab and mount
        Seir, whom thou wouldest not let Israel invade, when they came
        out of the land of Egypt, but they turned from them, and
        destroyed them not;

020:011 Behold, I say, how they reward us, to come to cast us out of
        thy possession, which thou hast given us to inherit.

020:012 O our God, wilt thou not judge them? for we have no might
        against this great company that cometh against us; neither
        know we what to do: but our eyes are upon thee.

020:013 And all Judah stood before the LORD, with their little ones,
        their wives, and their children.

020:014 Then upon Jahaziel the son of Zechariah, the son of Benaiah,
        the son of Jeiel, the son of Mattaniah, a Levite of the sons
        of Asaph, came the Spirit of the LORD in the midst of the
        congregation;

020:015 And he said, Hearken ye, all Judah, and ye inhabitants of
        Jerusalem, and thou king Jehoshaphat, Thus saith the LORD unto
        you, Be not afraid nor dismayed by reason of this great
        multitude; for the battle is not yours, but God's.

020:016 To morrow go ye down against them: behold, they come up by the
        cliff of Ziz; and ye shall find them at the end of the brook,
        before the wilderness of Jeruel.

020:017 Ye shall not need to fight in this battle: set yourselves,
        stand ye still, and see the salvation of the LORD with you, O
        Judah and Jerusalem: fear not, nor be dismayed; to morrow go
        out against them: for the LORD will be with you.

020:018 And Jehoshaphat bowed his head with his face to the ground:
        and all Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem fell before the
        LORD, worshipping the LORD.

020:019 And the Levites, of the children of the Kohathites, and of the
        children of the Korhites, stood up to praise the LORD God of
        Israel with a loud voice on high.

020:020 And they rose early in the morning, and went forth into the
        wilderness of Tekoa: and as they went forth, Jehoshaphat stood
        and said, Hear me, O Judah, and ye inhabitants of Jerusalem;
        Believe in the LORD your God, so shall ye be established;
        believe his prophets, so shall ye prosper.

020:021 And when he had consulted with the people, he appointed
        singers unto the LORD, and that should praise the beauty of
        holiness, as they went out before the army, and to say, Praise
        the LORD; for his mercy endureth for ever.

020:022 And when they began to sing and to praise, the LORD set
        ambushments against the children of Ammon, Moab, and mount
        Seir, which were come against Judah; and they were smitten.

020:023 For the children of Ammon and Moab stood up against the
        inhabitants of mount Seir, utterly to slay and destroy them:
        and when they had made an end of the inhabitants of Seir,
        every one helped to destroy another.

020:024 And when Judah came toward the watch tower in the wilderness,
        they looked unto the multitude, and, behold, they were dead
        bodies fallen to the earth, and none escaped.

020:025 And when Jehoshaphat and his people came to take away the
        spoil of them, they found among them in abundance both riches
        with the dead bodies, and precious jewels, which they stripped
        off for themselves, more than they could carry away: and they
        were three days in gathering of the spoil, it was so much.

020:026 And on the fourth day they assembled themselves in the valley
        of Berachah; for there they blessed the LORD: therefore the
        name of the same place was called, The valley of Berachah,
        unto this day.

020:027 Then they returned, every man of Judah and Jerusalem, and
        Jehoshaphat in the forefront of them, to go again to Jerusalem
        with joy; for the LORD had made them to rejoice over their
        enemies.

020:028 And they came to Jerusalem with psalteries and harps and
        trumpets unto the house of the LORD.

020:029 And the fear of God was on all the kingdoms of those
        countries, when they had heard that the LORD fought against
        the enemies of Israel.

020:030 So the realm of Jehoshaphat was quiet: for his God gave him
        rest round about.

020:031 And Jehoshaphat reigned over Judah: he was thirty and five
        years old when he began to reign, and he reigned twenty and
        five years in Jerusalem. And his mother's name was Azubah the
        daughter of Shilhi.

020:032 And he walked in the way of Asa his father, and departed not
        from it, doing that which was right in the sight of the LORD.

020:033 Howbeit the high places were not taken away: for as yet the
        people had not prepared their hearts unto the God of their
        fathers.

020:034 Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, first and last,
        behold, they are written in the book of Jehu the son of
        Hanani, who is mentioned in the book of the kings of Israel.

020:035 And after this did Jehoshaphat king of Judah join himself with
        Ahaziah king of Israel, who did very wickedly:

020:036 And he joined himself with him to make ships to go to
        Tarshish: and they made the ships in Eziongaber.

020:037 Then Eliezer the son of Dodavah of Mareshah prophesied against
        Jehoshaphat, saying, Because thou hast joined thyself with
        Ahaziah, the LORD hath broken thy works. And the ships were
        broken, that they were not able to go to Tarshish.

021:001 Now Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers, and was buried with
        his fathers in the city of David. And Jehoram his son reigned
        in his stead.

021:002 And he had brethren the sons of Jehoshaphat, Azariah, and
        Jehiel, and Zechariah, and Azariah, and Michael, and
        Shephatiah: all these were the sons of Jehoshaphat king of
        Israel.

021:003 And their father gave them great gifts of silver, and of gold,
        and of precious things, with fenced cities in Judah: but the
        kingdom gave he to Jehoram; because he was the firstborn.

021:004 Now when Jehoram was risen up to the kingdom of his father, he
        strengthened himself, and slew all his brethren with the
        sword, and divers also of the princes of Israel.

021:005 Jehoram was thirty and two years old when he began to reign,
        and he reigned eight years in Jerusalem.

021:006 And he walked in the way of the kings of Israel, like as did
        the house of Ahab: for he had the daughter of Ahab to wife:
        and he wrought that which was evil in the eyes of the LORD.

021:007 Howbeit the LORD would not destroy the house of David, because
        of the covenant that he had made with David, and as he
        promised to give a light to him and to his sons for ever.

021:008 In his days the Edomites revolted from under the dominion of
        Judah, and made themselves a king.

021:009 Then Jehoram went forth with his princes, and all his chariots
        with him: and he rose up by night, and smote the Edomites
        which compassed him in, and the captains of the chariots.

021:010 So the Edomites revolted from under the hand of Judah unto
        this day. The same time also did Libnah revolt from under his
        hand; because he had forsaken the LORD God of his fathers.

021:011 Moreover he made high places in the mountains of Judah and
        caused the inhabitants of Jerusalem to commit fornication, and
        compelled Judah thereto.

021:012 And there came a writing to him from Elijah the prophet,
        saying, Thus saith the LORD God of David thy father, Because
        thou hast not walked in the ways of Jehoshaphat thy father,
        nor in the ways of Asa king of Judah,

021:013 But hast walked in the way of the kings of Israel, and hast
        made Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to go a whoring,
        like to the whoredoms of the house of Ahab, and also hast
        slain thy brethren of thy father's house, which were better
        than thyself:

021:014 Behold, with a great plague will the LORD smite thy people,
        and thy children, and thy wives, and all thy goods:

021:015 And thou shalt have great sickness by disease of thy bowels,
        until thy bowels fall out by reason of the sickness day by
        day.

021:016 Moreover the LORD stirred up against Jehoram the spirit of the
        Philistines, and of the Arabians, that were near the
        Ethiopians:

021:017 And they came up into Judah, and brake into it, and carried
        away all the substance that was found in the king's house, and
        his sons also, and his wives; so that there was never a son
        left him, save Jehoahaz, the youngest of his sons.

021:018 And after all this the LORD smote him in his bowels with an
        incurable disease.

021:019 And it came to pass, that in process of time, after the end of
        two years, his bowels fell out by reason of his sickness: so
        he died of sore diseases. And his people made no burning for
        him, like the burning of his fathers.

021:020 Thirty and two years old was he when he began to reign, and he
        reigned in Jerusalem eight years, and departed without being
        desired. Howbeit they buried him in the city of David, but not
        in the sepulchres of the kings.

022:001 And the inhabitants of Jerusalem made Ahaziah his youngest son
        king in his stead: for the band of men that came with the
        Arabians to the camp had slain all the eldest. So Ahaziah the
        son of Jehoram king of Judah reigned.

022:002 Forty and two years old was Ahaziah when he began to reign,
        and he reigned one year in Jerusalem. His mother's name also
        was Athaliah the daughter of Omri.

022:003 He also walked in the ways of the house of Ahab: for his
        mother was his counsellor to do wickedly.

022:004 Wherefore he did evil in the sight of the LORD like the house
        of Ahab: for they were his counsellors after the death of his
        father to his destruction.

022:005 He walked also after their counsel, and went with Jehoram the
        son of Ahab king of Israel to war against Hazael king of Syria
        at Ramothgilead: and the Syrians smote Joram.

022:006 And he returned to be healed in Jezreel because of the wounds
        which were given him at Ramah, when he fought with Hazael king
        of Syria. And Azariah the son of Jehoram king of Judah went
        down to see Jehoram the son of Ahab at Jezreel, because he was
        sick.

022:007 And the destruction of Ahaziah was of God by coming to Joram:
        for when he was come, he went out with Jehoram against Jehu
        the son of Nimshi, whom the LORD had anointed to cut off the
        house of Ahab.

022:008 And it came to pass, that, when Jehu was executing judgment
        upon the house of Ahab, and found the princes of Judah, and
        the sons of the brethren of Ahaziah, that ministered to
        Ahaziah, he slew them.

022:009 And he sought Ahaziah: and they caught him, (for he was hid in
        Samaria,) and brought him to Jehu: and when they had slain
        him, they buried him: Because, said they, he is the son of
        Jehoshaphat, who sought the LORD with all his heart. So the
        house of Ahaziah had no power to keep still the kingdom.

022:010 But when Athaliah the mother of Ahaziah saw that her son was
        dead, she arose and destroyed all the seed royal of the house
        of Judah.

022:011 But Jehoshabeath, the daughter of the king, took Joash the son
        of Ahaziah, and stole him from among the king's sons that were
        slain, and put him and his nurse in a bedchamber. So
        Jehoshabeath, the daughter of king Jehoram, the wife of
        Jehoiada the priest, (for she was the sister of Ahaziah,) hid
        him from Athaliah, so that she slew him not.

022:012 And he was with them hid in the house of God six years: and
        Athaliah reigned over the land.

023:001 And in the seventh year Jehoiada strengthened himself, and
        took the captains of hundreds, Azariah the son of Jeroham, and
        Ishmael the son of Jehohanan, and Azariah the son of Obed, and
        Maaseiah the son of Adaiah, and Elishaphat the son of Zichri,
        into covenant with him.

023:002 And they went about in Judah, and gathered the Levites out of
        all the cities of Judah, and the chief of the fathers of
        Israel, and they came to Jerusalem.

023:003 And all the congregation made a covenant with the king in the
        house of God. And he said unto them, Behold, the king's son
        shall reign, as the LORD hath said of the sons of David.

023:004 This is the thing that ye shall do; A third part of you
        entering on the sabbath, of the priests and of the Levites,
        shall be porters of the doors;

023:005 And a third part shall be at the king's house; and a third
        part at the gate of the foundation: and all the people shall
        be in the courts of the house of the LORD.

023:006 But let none come into the house of the LORD, save the
        priests, and they that minister of the Levites; they shall go
        in, for they are holy: but all the people shall keep the watch
        of the LORD.

023:007 And the Levites shall compass the king round about, every man
        with his weapons in his hand; and whosoever else cometh into
        the house, he shall be put to death: but be ye with the king
        when he cometh in, and when he goeth out.

023:008 So the Levites and all Judah did according to all things that
        Jehoiada the priest had commanded, and took every man his men
        that were to come in on the sabbath, with them that were to go
        out on the sabbath: for Jehoiada the priest dismissed not the
        courses.

023:009 Moreover Jehoiada the priest delivered to the captains of
        hundreds spears, and bucklers, and shields, that had been king
        David's, which were in the house of God.

023:010 And he set all the people, every man having his weapon in his
        hand, from the right side of the temple to the left side of
        the temple, along by the altar and the temple, by the king
        round about.

023:011 Then they brought out the king's son, and put upon him the
        crown, and gave him the testimony, and made him king. And
        Jehoiada and his sons anointed him, and said, God save the
        king.

023:012 Now when Athaliah heard the noise of the people running and
        praising the king, she came to the people into the house of
        the LORD:

023:013 And she looked, and, behold, the king stood at his pillar at
        the entering in, and the princes and the trumpets by the king:
        and all the people of the land rejoiced, and sounded with
        trumpets, also the singers with instruments of musick, and
        such as taught to sing praise. Then Athaliah rent her clothes,
        and said, Treason, Treason.

023:014 Then Jehoiada the priest brought out the captains of hundreds
        that were set over the host, and said unto them, Have her
        forth of the ranges: and whoso followeth her, let him be slain
        with the sword. For the priest said, Slay her not in the house
        of the LORD.

023:015 So they laid hands on her; and when she was come to the
        entering of the horse gate by the king's house, they slew her
        there.

023:016 And Jehoiada made a covenant between him, and between all the
        people, and between the king, that they should be the LORD's
        people.

023:017 Then all the people went to the house of Baal, and brake it
        down, and brake his altars and his images in pieces, and slew
        Mattan the priest of Baal before the altars.

023:018 Also Jehoiada appointed the offices of the house of the LORD
        by the hand of the priests the Levites, whom David had
        distributed in the house of the LORD, to offer the burnt
        offerings of the LORD, as it is written in the law of Moses,
        with rejoicing and with singing, as it was ordained by David.

023:019 And he set the porters at the gates of the house of the LORD,
        that none which was unclean in any thing should enter in.

023:020 And he took the captains of hundreds, and the nobles, and the
        governors of the people, and all the people of the land, and
        brought down the king from the house of the LORD: and they
        came through the high gate into the king's house, and set the
        king upon the throne of the kingdom.

023:021 And all the people of the land rejoiced: and the city was
        quiet, after that they had slain Athaliah with the sword.

024:001 Joash was seven years old when he began to reign, and he
        reigned forty years in Jerusalem. His mother's name also was
        Zibiah of Beersheba.

024:002 And Joash did that which was right in the sight of the LORD
        all the days of Jehoiada the priest.

024:003 And Jehoiada took for him two wives; and he begat sons and
        daughters.

024:004 And it came to pass after this, that Joash was minded to
        repair the house of the LORD.

024:005 And he gathered together the priests and the Levites, and said
        to them, Go out unto the cities of Judah, and gather of all
        Israel money to repair the house of your God from year to
        year, and see that ye hasten the matter. Howbeit the Levites
        hastened it not.

024:006 And the king called for Jehoiada the chief, and said unto him,
        Why hast thou not required of the Levites to bring in out of
        Judah and out of Jerusalem the collection, according to the
        commandment of Moses the servant of the LORD, and of the
        congregation of Israel, for the tabernacle of witness?

024:007 For the sons of Athaliah, that wicked woman, had broken up the
        house of God; and also all the dedicated things of the house
        of the LORD did they bestow upon Baalim.

024:008 And at the king's commandment they made a chest, and set it
        without at the gate of the house of the LORD.

024:009 And they made a proclamation through Judah and Jerusalem, to
        bring in to the LORD the collection that Moses the servant of
        God laid upon Israel in the wilderness.

024:010 And all the princes and all the people rejoiced, and brought
        in, and cast into the chest, until they had made an end.

024:011 Now it came to pass, that at what time the chest was brought
        unto the king's office by the hand of the Levites, and when
        they saw that there was much money, the king's scribe and the
        high priest's officer came and emptied the chest, and took it,
        and carried it to his place again. Thus they did day by day,
        and gathered money in abundance.

024:012 And the king and Jehoiada gave it to such as did the work of
        the service of the house of the LORD, and hired masons and
        carpenters to repair the house of the LORD, and also such as
        wrought iron and brass to mend the house of the LORD.

024:013 So the workmen wrought, and the work was perfected by them,
        and they set the house of God in his state, and strengthened
        it.

024:014 And when they had finished it, they brought the rest of the
        money before the king and Jehoiada, whereof were made vessels
        for the house of the LORD, even vessels to minister, and to
        offer withal, and spoons, and vessels of gold and silver. And
        they offered burnt offerings in the house of the LORD
        continually all the days of Jehoiada.

024:015 But Jehoiada waxed old, and was full of days when he died; an
        hundred and thirty years old was he when he died.

024:016 And they buried him in the city of David among the kings,
        because he had done good in Israel, both toward God, and
        toward his house.

024:017 Now after the death of Jehoiada came the princes of Judah, and
        made obeisance to the king. Then the king hearkened unto them.

024:018 And they left the house of the LORD God of their fathers, and
        served groves and idols: and wrath came upon Judah and
        Jerusalem for this their trespass.

024:019 Yet he sent prophets to them, to bring them again unto the
        LORD; and they testified against them: but they would not give
        ear.

024:020 And the Spirit of God came upon Zechariah the son of Jehoiada
        the priest, which stood above the people, and said unto them,
        Thus saith God, Why transgress ye the commandments of the
        LORD, that ye cannot prosper? because ye have forsaken the
        LORD, he hath also forsaken you.

024:021 And they conspired against him, and stoned him with stones at
        the commandment of the king in the court of the house of the
        LORD.

024:022 Thus Joash the king remembered not the kindness which Jehoiada
        his father had done to him, but slew his son. And when he
        died, he said, The LORD look upon it, and require it.

024:023 And it came to pass at the end of the year, that the host of
        Syria came up against him: and they came to Judah and
        Jerusalem, and destroyed all the princes of the people from
        among the people, and sent all the spoil of them unto the king
        of Damascus.

024:024 For the army of the Syrians came with a small company of men,
        and the LORD delivered a very great host into their hand,
        because they had forsaken the LORD God of their fathers. So
        they executed judgment against Joash.

024:025 And when they were departed from him, (for they left him in
        great diseases,) his own servants conspired against him for
        the blood of the sons of Jehoiada the priest, and slew him on
        his bed, and he died: and they buried him in the city of
        David, but they buried him not in the sepulchres of the kings.

024:026 And these are they that conspired against him; Zabad the son
        of Shimeath an Ammonitess, and Jehozabad the son of Shimrith a
        Moabitess.

024:027 Now concerning his sons, and the greatness of the burdens laid
        upon him, and the repairing of the house of God, behold, they
        are written in the story of the book of the kings. And Amaziah
        his son reigned in his stead.

025:001 Amaziah was twenty and five years old when he began to reign,
        and he reigned twenty and nine years in Jerusalem. And his
        mother's name was Jehoaddan of Jerusalem.

025:002 And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, but
        not with a perfect heart.

025:003 Now it came to pass, when the kingdom was established to him,
        that he slew his servants that had killed the king his father.

025:004 But he slew not their children, but did as it is written in
        the law in the book of Moses, where the LORD commanded,
        saying, The fathers shall not die for the children, neither
        shall the children die for the fathers, but every man shall
        die for his own sin.

025:005 Moreover Amaziah gathered Judah together, and made them
        captains over thousands, and captains over hundreds, according
        to the houses of their fathers, throughout all Judah and
        Benjamin: and he numbered them from twenty years old and
        above, and found them three hundred thousand choice men, able
        to go forth to war, that could handle spear and shield.

025:006 He hired also an hundred thousand mighty men of valour out of
        Israel for an hundred talents of silver.

025:007 But there came a man of God to him, saying, O king, let not
        the army of Israel go with thee; for the LORD is not with
        Israel, to wit, with all the children of Ephraim.

025:008 But if thou wilt go, do it; be strong for the battle: God
        shall make thee fall before the enemy: for God hath power to
        help, and to cast down.

025:009 And Amaziah said to the man of God, But what shall we do for
        the hundred talents which I have given to the army of Israel?
        And the man of God answered, The LORD is able to give thee
        much more than this.

025:010 Then Amaziah separated them, to wit, the army that was come to
        him out of Ephraim, to go home again: wherefore their anger
        was greatly kindled against Judah, and they returned home in
        great anger.

025:011 And Amaziah strengthened himself, and led forth his people,
        and went to the valley of salt, and smote of the children of
        Seir ten thousand.

025:012 And other ten thousand left alive did the children of Judah
        carry away captive, and brought them unto the top of the rock,
        and cast them down from the top of the rock, that they all
        were broken in pieces.

025:013 But the soldiers of the army which Amaziah sent back, that
        they should not go with him to battle, fell upon the cities of
        Judah, from Samaria even unto Bethhoron, and smote three
        thousand of them, and took much spoil.

025:014 Now it came to pass, after that Amaziah was come from the
        slaughter of the Edomites, that he brought the gods of the
        children of Seir, and set them up to be his gods, and bowed
        down himself before them, and burned incense unto them.

025:015 Wherefore the anger of the LORD was kindled against Amaziah,
        and he sent unto him a prophet, which said unto him, Why hast
        thou sought after the gods of the people, which could not
        deliver their own people out of thine hand?

025:016 And it came to pass, as he talked with him, that the king said
        unto him, Art thou made of the king's counsel? forbear; why
        shouldest thou be smitten? Then the prophet forbare, and said,
        I know that God hath determined to destroy thee, because thou
        hast done this, and hast not hearkened unto my counsel.

025:017 Then Amaziah king of Judah took advice, and sent to Joash, the
        son of Jehoahaz, the son of Jehu, king of Israel, saying,
        Come, let us see one another in the face.

025:018 And Joash king of Israel sent to Amaziah king of Judah,
        saying, The thistle that was in Lebanon sent to the cedar that
        was in Lebanon, saying, Give thy daughter to my son to wife:
        and there passed by a wild beast that was in Lebanon, and
        trode down the thistle.

025:019 Thou sayest, Lo, thou hast smitten the Edomites; and thine
        heart lifteth thee up to boast: abide now at home; why
        shouldest thou meddle to thine hurt, that thou shouldest fall,
        even thou, and Judah with thee?

025:020 But Amaziah would not hear; for it came of God, that he might
        deliver them into the hand of their enemies, because they
        sought after the gods of Edom.

025:021 So Joash the king of Israel went up; and they saw one another
        in the face, both he and Amaziah king of Judah, at
        Bethshemesh, which belongeth to Judah.

025:022 And Judah was put to the worse before Israel, and they fled
        every man to his tent.

025:023 And Joash the king of Israel took Amaziah king of Judah, the
        son of Joash, the son of Jehoahaz, at Bethshemesh, and brought
        him to Jerusalem, and brake down the wall of Jerusalem from
        the gate of Ephraim to the corner gate, four hundred cubits.

025:024 And he took all the gold and the silver, and all the vessels
        that were found in the house of God with Obededom, and the
        treasures of the king's house, the hostages also, and returned
        to Samaria.

025:025 And Amaziah the son of Joash king of Judah lived after the
        death of Joash son of Jehoahaz king of Israel fifteen years.

025:026 Now the rest of the acts of Amaziah, first and last, behold,
        are they not written in the book of the kings of Judah and
        Israel?

025:027 Now after the time that Amaziah did turn away from following
        the LORD they made a conspiracy against him in Jerusalem; and
        he fled to Lachish: but they sent to Lachish after him, and
        slew him there.

025:028 And they brought him upon horses, and buried him with his
        fathers in the city of Judah.

026:001 Then all the people of Judah took Uzziah, who was sixteen
        years old, and made him king in the room of his father
        Amaziah.

026:002 He built Eloth, and restored it to Judah, after that the king
        slept with his fathers.

026:003 Sixteen years old was Uzziah when he began to reign, and he
        reigned fifty and two years in Jerusalem. His mother's name
        also was Jecoliah of Jerusalem.

026:004 And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD,
        according to all that his father Amaziah did.

026:005 And he sought God in the days of Zechariah, who had
        understanding in the visions of God: and as long as he sought
        the LORD, God made him to prosper.

026:006 And he went forth and warred against the Philistines, and
        brake down the wall of Gath, and the wall of Jabneh, and the
        wall of Ashdod, and built cities about Ashdod, and among the
        Philistines.

026:007 And God helped him against the Philistines, and against the
        Arabians that dwelt in Gurbaal, and the Mehunims.

026:008 And the Ammonites gave gifts to Uzziah: and his name spread
        abroad even to the entering in of Egypt; for he strengthened
        himself exceedingly.

026:009 Moreover Uzziah built towers in Jerusalem at the corner gate,
        and at the valley gate, and at the turning of the wall, and
        fortified them.

026:010 Also he built towers in the desert, and digged many wells: for
        he had much cattle, both in the low country, and in the
        plains: husbandmen also, and vine dressers in the mountains,
        and in Carmel: for he loved husbandry.

026:011 Moreover Uzziah had an host of fighting men, that went out to
        war by bands, according to the number of their account by the
        hand of Jeiel the scribe and Maaseiah the ruler, under the
        hand of Hananiah, one of the king's captains.

026:012 The whole number of the chief of the fathers of the mighty men
        of valour were two thousand and six hundred.

026:013 And under their hand was an army, three hundred thousand and
        seven thousand and five hundred, that made war with mighty
        power, to help the king against the enemy.

026:014 And Uzziah prepared for them throughout all the host shields,
        and spears, and helmets, and habergeons, and bows, and slings
        to cast stones.

026:015 And he made in Jerusalem engines, invented by cunning men, to
        be on the towers and upon the bulwarks, to shoot arrows and
        great stones withal. And his name spread far abroad; for he
        was marvellously helped, till he was strong.

026:016 But when he was strong, his heart was lifted up to his
        destruction: for he transgressed against the LORD his God, and
        went into the temple of the LORD to burn incense upon the
        altar of incense.

026:017 And Azariah the priest went in after him, and with him
        fourscore priests of the LORD, that were valiant men:

026:018 And they withstood Uzziah the king, and said unto him, It
        appertaineth not unto thee, Uzziah, to burn incense unto the
        LORD, but to the priests the sons of Aaron, that are
        consecrated to burn incense: go out of the sanctuary; for thou
        hast trespassed; neither shall it be for thine honour from the
        LORD God.

026:019 Then Uzziah was wroth, and had a censer in his hand to burn
        incense: and while he was wroth with the priests, the leprosy
        even rose up in his forehead before the priests in the house
        of the LORD, from beside the incense altar.

026:020 And Azariah the chief priest, and all the priests, looked upon
        him, and, behold, he was leprous in his forehead, and they
        thrust him out from thence; yea, himself hasted also to go
        out, because the LORD had smitten him.

026:021 And Uzziah the king was a leper unto the day of his death, and
        dwelt in a several house, being a leper; for he was cut off
        from the house of the LORD: and Jotham his son was over the
        king's house, judging the people of the land.

026:022 Now the rest of the acts of Uzziah, first and last, did Isaiah
        the prophet, the son of Amoz, write.

026:023 So Uzziah slept with his fathers, and they buried him with his
        fathers in the field of the burial which belonged to the
        kings; for they said, He is a leper: and Jotham his son
        reigned in his stead.

027:001 Jotham was twenty and five years old when he began to reign,
        and he reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem. His mother's name
        also was Jerushah, the daughter of Zadok.

027:002 And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD,
        according to all that his father Uzziah did: howbeit he
        entered not into the temple of the LORD. And the people did
        yet corruptly.

027:003 He built the high gate of the house of the LORD, and on the
        wall of Ophel he built much.

027:004 Moreover he built cities in the mountains of Judah, and in the
        forests he built castles and towers.

027:005 He fought also with the king of the Ammonites, and prevailed
        against them. And the children of Ammon gave him the same year
        an hundred talents of silver, and ten thousand measures of
        wheat, and ten thousand of barley. So much did the children of
        Ammon pay unto him, both the second year, and the third.

027:006 So Jotham became mighty, because he prepared his ways before
        the LORD his God.

027:007 Now the rest of the acts of Jotham, and all his wars, and his
        ways, lo, they are written in the book of the kings of Israel
        and Judah.

027:008 He was five and twenty years old when he began to reign, and
        reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem.

027:009 And Jotham slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the
        city of David: and Ahaz his son reigned in his stead.

028:001 Ahaz was twenty years old when he began to reign, and he
        reigned sixteen years in Jerusalem: but he did not that which
        was right in the sight of the LORD, like David his father:

028:002 For he walked in the ways of the kings of Israel, and made
        also molten images for Baalim.

028:003 Moreover he burnt incense in the valley of the son of Hinnom,
        and burnt his children in the fire, after the abominations of
        the heathen whom the LORD had cast out before the children of
        Israel.

028:004 He sacrificed also and burnt incense in the high places, and
        on the hills, and under every green tree.

028:005 Wherefore the LORD his God delivered him into the hand of the
        king of Syria; and they smote him, and carried away a great
        multitude of them captives, and brought them to Damascus. And
        he was also delivered into the hand of the king of Israel, who
        smote him with a great slaughter.

028:006 For Pekah the son of Remaliah slew in Judah an hundred and
        twenty thousand in one day, which were all valiant men;
        because they had forsaken the LORD God of their fathers.

028:007 And Zichri, a mighty man of Ephraim, slew Maaseiah the king's
        son, and Azrikam the governor of the house, and Elkanah that
        was next to the king.

028:008 And the children of Israel carried away captive of their
        brethren two hundred thousand, women, sons, and daughters, and
        took also away much spoil from them, and brought the spoil to
        Samaria.

028:009 But a prophet of the LORD was there, whose name was Oded: and
        he went out before the host that came to Samaria, and said
        unto them, Behold, because the LORD God of your fathers was
        wroth with Judah, he hath delivered them into your hand, and
        ye have slain them in a rage that reacheth up unto heaven.

028:010 And now ye purpose to keep under the children of Judah and
        Jerusalem for bondmen and bondwomen unto you: but are there
        not with you, even with you, sins against the LORD your God?

028:011 Now hear me therefore, and deliver the captives again, which
        ye have taken captive of your brethren: for the fierce wrath
        of the LORD is upon you.

028:012 Then certain of the heads of the children of Ephraim, Azariah
        the son of Johanan, Berechiah the son of Meshillemoth, and
        Jehizkiah the son of Shallum, and Amasa the son of Hadlai,
        stood up against them that came from the war,

028:013 And said unto them, Ye shall not bring in the captives hither:
        for whereas we have offended against the LORD already, ye
        intend to add more to our sins and to our trespass: for our
        trespass is great, and there is fierce wrath against Israel.

028:014 So the armed men left the captives and the spoil before the
        princes and all the congregation.

028:015 And the men which were expressed by name rose up, and took the
        captives, and with the spoil clothed all that were naked among
        them, and arrayed them, and shod them, and gave them to eat
        and to drink, and anointed them, and carried all the feeble of
        them upon asses, and brought them to Jericho, the city of palm
        trees, to their brethren: then they returned to Samaria.

028:016 At that time did king Ahaz send unto the kings of Assyria to
        help him.

028:017 For again the Edomites had come and smitten Judah, and carried
        away captives.

028:018 The Philistines also had invaded the cities of the low
        country, and of the south of Judah, and had taken Bethshemesh,
        and Ajalon, and Gederoth, and Shocho with the villages
        thereof, and Timnah with the villages thereof, Gimzo also and
        the villages thereof: and they dwelt there.

028:019 For the LORD brought Judah low because of Ahaz king of Israel;
        for he made Judah naked, and transgressed sore against the
        LORD.

028:020 And Tilgathpilneser king of Assyria came unto him, and
        distressed him, but strengthened him not.

028:021 For Ahaz took away a portion out of the house of the LORD, and
        out of the house of the king, and of the princes, and gave it
        unto the king of Assyria: but he helped him not.

028:022 And in the time of his distress did he trespass yet more
        against the LORD: this is that king Ahaz.

028:023 For he sacrificed unto the gods of Damascus, which smote him:
        and he said, Because the gods of the kings of Syria help them,
        therefore will I sacrifice to them, that they may help me. But
        they were the ruin of him, and of all Israel.

028:024 And Ahaz gathered together the vessels of the house of God,
        and cut in pieces the vessels of the house of God, and shut up
        the doors of the house of the LORD, and he made him altars in
        every corner of Jerusalem.

028:025 And in every several city of Judah he made high places to burn
        incense unto other gods, and provoked to anger the LORD God of
        his fathers.

028:026 Now the rest of his acts and of all his ways, first and last,
        behold, they are written in the book of the kings of Judah and
        Israel.

028:027 And Ahaz slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the
        city, even in Jerusalem: but they brought him not into the
        sepulchres of the kings of Israel: and Hezekiah his son
        reigned in his stead.

029:001 Hezekiah began to reign when he was five and twenty years old,
        and he reigned nine and twenty years in Jerusalem. And his
        mother's name was Abijah, the daughter of Zechariah.

029:002 And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD,
        according to all that David his father had done.

029:003 He in the first year of his reign, in the first month, opened
        the doors of the house of the LORD, and repaired them.

029:004 And he brought in the priests and the Levites, and gathered
        them together into the east street,

029:005 And said unto them, Hear me, ye Levites, sanctify now
        yourselves, and sanctify the house of the LORD God of your
        fathers, and carry forth the filthiness out of the holy place.

029:006 For our fathers have trespassed, and done that which was evil
        in the eyes of the LORD our God, and have forsaken him, and
        have turned away their faces from the habitation of the LORD,
        and turned their backs.

029:007 Also they have shut up the doors of the porch, and put out the
        lamps, and have not burned incense nor offered burnt offerings
        in the holy place unto the God of Israel.

029:008 Wherefore the wrath of the LORD was upon Judah and Jerusalem,
        and he hath delivered them to trouble, to astonishment, and to
        hissing, as ye see with your eyes.

029:009 For, lo, our fathers have fallen by the sword, and our sons
        and our daughters and our wives are in captivity for this.

029:010 Now it is in mine heart to make a covenant with the LORD God
        of Israel, that his fierce wrath may turn away from us.

029:011 My sons, be not now negligent: for the LORD hath chosen you to
        stand before him, to serve him, and that ye should minister
        unto him, and burn incense.

029:012 Then the Levites arose, Mahath the son of Amasai, and Joel the
        son of Azariah, of the sons of the Kohathites: and of the sons
        of Merari, Kish the son of Abdi, and Azariah the son of
        Jehalelel: and of the Gershonites; Joah the son of Zimmah, and
        Eden the son of Joah:

029:013 And of the sons of Elizaphan; Shimri, and Jeiel: and of the
        sons of Asaph; Zechariah, and Mattaniah:

029:014 And of the sons of Heman; Jehiel, and Shimei: and of the sons
        of Jeduthun; Shemaiah, and Uzziel.

029:015 And they gathered their brethren, and sanctified themselves,
        and came, according to the commandment of the king, by the
        words of the LORD, to cleanse the house of the LORD.

029:016 And the priests went into the inner part of the house of the
        LORD, to cleanse it, and brought out all the uncleanness that
        they found in the temple of the LORD into the court of the
        house of the LORD. And the Levites took it, to carry it out
        abroad into the brook Kidron.

029:017 Now they began on the first day of the first month to
        sanctify, and on the eighth day of the month came they to the
        porch of the LORD: so they sanctified the house of the LORD in
        eight days; and in the sixteenth day of the first month they
        made an end.

029:018 Then they went in to Hezekiah the king, and said, We have
        cleansed all the house of the LORD, and the altar of burnt
        offering, with all the vessels thereof, and the shewbread
        table, with all the vessels thereof.

029:019 Moreover all the vessels, which king Ahaz in his reign did
        cast away in his transgression, have we prepared and
        sanctified, and, behold, they are before the altar of the
        LORD.

029:020 Then Hezekiah the king rose early, and gathered the rulers of
        the city, and went up to the house of the LORD.

029:021 And they brought seven bullocks, and seven rams, and seven
        lambs, and seven he goats, for a sin offering for the kingdom,
        and for the sanctuary, and for Judah. And he commanded the
        priests the sons of Aaron to offer them on the altar of the
        LORD.

029:022 So they killed the bullocks, and the priests received the
        blood, and sprinkled it on the altar: likewise, when they had
        killed the rams, they sprinkled the blood upon the altar: they
        killed also the lambs, and they sprinkled the blood upon the
        altar.

029:023 And they brought forth the he goats for the sin offering
        before the king and the congregation; and they laid their
        hands upon them:

029:024 And the priests killed them, and they made reconciliation with
        their blood upon the altar, to make an atonement for all
        Israel: for the king commanded that the burnt offering and the
        sin offering should be made for all Israel.

029:025 And he set the Levites in the house of the LORD with cymbals,
        with psalteries, and with harps, according to the commandment
        of David, and of Gad the king's seer, and Nathan the prophet:
        for so was the commandment of the LORD by his prophets.

029:026 And the Levites stood with the instruments of David, and the
        priests with the trumpets.

029:027 And Hezekiah commanded to offer the burnt offering upon the
        altar. And when the burnt offering began, the song of the LORD
        began also with the trumpets, and with the instruments
        ordained by David king of Israel.

029:028 And all the congregation worshipped, and the singers sang, and
        the trumpeters sounded: and all this continued until the burnt
        offering was finished.

029:029 And when they had made an end of offering, the king and all
        that were present with him bowed themselves, and worshipped.

029:030 Moreover Hezekiah the king and the princes commanded the
        Levites to sing praise unto the LORD with the words of David,
        and of Asaph the seer. And they sang praises with gladness,
        and they bowed their heads and worshipped.

029:031 Then Hezekiah answered and said, Now ye have consecrated
        yourselves unto the LORD, come near and bring sacrifices and
        thank offerings into the house of the LORD. And the
        congregation brought in sacrifices and thank offerings; and as
        many as were of a free heart burnt offerings.

029:032 And the number of the burnt offerings, which the congregation
        brought, was threescore and ten bullocks, an hundred rams, and
        two hundred lambs: all these were for a burnt offering to the
        LORD.

029:033 And the consecrated things were six hundred oxen and three
        thousand sheep.

029:034 But the priests were too few, so that they could not flay all
        the burnt offerings: wherefore their brethren the Levites did
        help them, till the work was ended, and until the other
        priests had sanctified themselves: for the Levites were more
        upright in heart to sanctify themselves than the priests.

029:035 And also the burnt offerings were in abundance, with the fat
        of the peace offerings, and the drink offerings for every
        burnt offering. So the service of the house of the LORD was
        set in order.

029:036 And Hezekiah rejoiced, and all the people, that God had
        prepared the people: for the thing was done suddenly.

030:001 And Hezekiah sent to all Israel and Judah, and wrote letters
        also to Ephraim and Manasseh, that they should come to the
        house of the LORD at Jerusalem, to keep the passover unto the
        LORD God of Israel.

030:002 For the king had taken counsel, and his princes, and all the
        congregation in Jerusalem, to keep the passover in the second
        month.

030:003 For they could not keep it at that time, because the priests
        had not sanctified themselves sufficiently, neither had the
        people gathered themselves together to Jerusalem.

030:004 And the thing pleased the king and all the congregation.

030:005 So they established a decree to make proclamation throughout
        all Israel, from Beersheba even to Dan, that they should come
        to keep the passover unto the LORD God of Israel at Jerusalem:
        for they had not done it of a long time in such sort as it was
        written.

030:006 So the posts went with the letters from the king and his
        princes throughout all Israel and Judah, and according to the
        commandment of the king, saying, Ye children of Israel, turn
        again unto the LORD God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, and he
        will return to the remnant of you, that are escaped out of the
        hand of the kings of Assyria.

030:007 And be not ye like your fathers, and like your brethren, which
        trespassed against the LORD God of their fathers, who
        therefore gave them up to desolation, as ye see.

030:008 Now be ye not stiffnecked, as your fathers were, but yield
        yourselves unto the LORD, and enter into his sanctuary, which
        he hath sanctified for ever: and serve the LORD your God, that
        the fierceness of his wrath may turn away from you.

030:009 For if ye turn again unto the LORD, your brethren and your
        children shall find compassion before them that lead them
        captive, so that they shall come again into this land: for the
        LORD your God is gracious and merciful, and will not turn away
        his face from you, if ye return unto him.

030:010 So the posts passed from city to city through the country of
        Ephraim and Manasseh even unto Zebulun: but they laughed them
        to scorn, and mocked them.

030:011 Nevertheless divers of Asher and Manasseh and of Zebulun
        humbled themselves, and came to Jerusalem.

030:012 Also in Judah the hand of God was to give them one heart to do
        the commandment of the king and of the princes, by the word of
        the LORD.

030:013 And there assembled at Jerusalem much people to keep the feast
        of unleavened bread in the second month, a very great
        congregation.

030:014 And they arose and took away the altars that were in
        Jerusalem, and all the altars for incense took they away, and
        cast them into the brook Kidron.

030:015 Then they killed the passover on the fourteenth day of the
        second month: and the priests and the Levites were ashamed,
        and sanctified themselves, and brought in the burnt offerings
        into the house of the LORD.

030:016 And they stood in their place after their manner, according to
        the law of Moses the man of God: the priests sprinkled the
        blood, which they received of the hand of the Levites.

030:017 For there were many in the congregation that were not
        sanctified: therefore the Levites had the charge of the
        killing of the passovers for every one that was not clean, to
        sanctify them unto the LORD.

030:018 For a multitude of the people, even many of Ephraim, and
        Manasseh, Issachar, and Zebulun, had not cleansed themselves,
        yet did they eat the passover otherwise than it was written.
        But Hezekiah prayed for them, saying, The good LORD pardon
        every one

030:019 That prepareth his heart to seek God, the LORD God of his
        fathers, though he be not cleansed according to the
        purification of the sanctuary.

030:020 And the LORD hearkened to Hezekiah, and healed the people.

030:021 And the children of Israel that were present at Jerusalem kept
        the feast of unleavened bread seven days with great gladness:
        and the Levites and the priests praised the LORD day by day,
        singing with loud instruments unto the LORD.

030:022 And Hezekiah spake comfortably unto all the Levites that
        taught the good knowledge of the LORD: and they did eat
        throughout the feast seven days, offering peace offerings, and
        making confession to the LORD God of their fathers.

030:023 And the whole assembly took counsel to keep other seven days:
        and they kept other seven days with gladness.

030:024 For Hezekiah king of Judah did give to the congregation a
        thousand bullocks and seven thousand sheep; and the princes
        gave to the congregation a thousand bullocks and ten thousand
        sheep: and a great number of priests sanctified themselves.

030:025 And all the congregation of Judah, with the priests and the
        Levites, and all the congregation that came out of Israel, and
        the strangers that came out of the land of Israel, and that
        dwelt in Judah, rejoiced.

030:026 So there was great joy in Jerusalem: for since the time of
        Solomon the son of David king of Israel there was not the like
        in Jerusalem.

030:027 Then the priests the Levites arose and blessed the people: and
        their voice was heard, and their prayer came up to his holy
        dwelling place, even unto heaven.

031:001 Now when all this was finished, all Israel that were present
        went out to the cities of Judah, and brake the images in
        pieces, and cut down the groves, and threw down the high
        places and the altars out of all Judah and Benjamin, in
        Ephraim also and Manasseh, until they had utterly destroyed
        them all. Then all the children of Israel returned, every man
        to his possession, into their own cities.

031:002 And Hezekiah appointed the courses of the priests and the
        Levites after their courses, every man according to his
        service, the priests and Levites for burnt offerings and for
        peace offerings, to minister, and to give thanks, and to
        praise in the gates of the tents of the LORD.

031:003 He appointed also the king's portion of his substance for the
        burnt offerings, to wit, for the morning and evening burnt
        offerings, and the burnt offerings for the sabbaths, and for
        the new moons, and for the set feasts, as it is written in the
        law of the LORD.

031:004 Moreover he commanded the people that dwelt in Jerusalem to
        give the portion of the priests and the Levites, that they
        might be encouraged in the law of the LORD.

031:005 And as soon as the commandment came abroad, the children of
        Israel brought in abundance the firstfruits of corn, wine, and
        oil, and honey, and of all the increase of the field; and the
        tithe of all things brought they in abundantly.

031:006 And concerning the children of Israel and Judah, that dwelt in
        the cities of Judah, they also brought in the tithe of oxen
        and sheep, and the tithe of holy things which were consecrated
        unto the LORD their God, and laid them by heaps.

031:007 In the third month they began to lay the foundation of the
        heaps, and finished them in the seventh month.

031:008 And when Hezekiah and the princes came and saw the heaps, they
        blessed the LORD, and his people Israel.

031:009 Then Hezekiah questioned with the priests and the Levites
        concerning the heaps.

031:010 And Azariah the chief priest of the house of Zadok answered
        him, and said, Since the people began to bring the offerings
        into the house of the LORD, we have had enough to eat, and
        have left plenty: for the LORD hath blessed his people; and
        that which is left is this great store.

031:011 Then Hezekiah commanded to prepare chambers in the house of
        the LORD; and they prepared them,

031:012 And brought in the offerings and the tithes and the dedicated
        things faithfully: over which Cononiah the Levite was ruler,
        and Shimei his brother was the next.

031:013 And Jehiel, and Azaziah, and Nahath, and Asahel, and Jerimoth,
        and Jozabad, and Eliel, and Ismachiah, and Mahath, and
        Benaiah, were overseers under the hand of Cononiah and Shimei
        his brother, at the commandment of Hezekiah the king, and
        Azariah the ruler of the house of God.

031:014 And Kore the son of Imnah the Levite, the porter toward the
        east, was over the freewill offerings of God, to distribute
        the oblations of the LORD, and the most holy things.

031:015 And next him were Eden, and Miniamin, and Jeshua, and
        Shemaiah, Amariah, and Shecaniah, in the cities of the
        priests, in their set office, to give to their brethren by
        courses, as well to the great as to the small:

031:016 Beside their genealogy of males, from three years old and
        upward, even unto every one that entereth into the house of
        the LORD, his daily portion for their service in their charges
        according to their courses;

031:017 Both to the genealogy of the priests by the house of their
        fathers, and the Levites from twenty years old and upward, in
        their charges by their courses;

031:018 And to the genealogy of all their little ones, their wives,
        and their sons, and their daughters, through all the
        congregation: for in their set office they sanctified
        themselves in holiness:

031:019 Also of the sons of Aaron the priests, which were in the
        fields of the suburbs of their cities, in every several city,
        the men that were expressed by name, to give portions to all
        the males among the priests, and to all that were reckoned by
        genealogies among the Levites.

031:020 And thus did Hezekiah throughout all Judah, and wrought that
        which was good and right and truth before the LORD his God.

031:021 And in every work that he began in the service of the house of
        God, and in the law, and in the commandments, to seek his God,
        he did it with all his heart, and prospered.

032:001 After these things, and the establishment thereof, Sennacherib
        king of Assyria came, and entered into Judah, and encamped
        against the fenced cities, and thought to win them for
        himself.

032:002 And when Hezekiah saw that Sennacherib was come, and that he
        was purposed to fight against Jerusalem,

032:003 He took counsel with his princes and his mighty men to stop
        the waters of the fountains which were without the city: and
        they did help him.

032:004 So there was gathered much people together, who stopped all
        the fountains, and the brook that ran through the midst of the
        land, saying, Why should the kings of Assyria come, and find
        much water?

032:005 Also he strengthened himself, and built up all the wall that
        was broken, and raised it up to the towers, and another wall
        without, and repaired Millo in the city of David, and made
        darts and shields in abundance.

032:006 And he set captains of war over the people, and gathered them
        together to him in the street of the gate of the city, and
        spake comfortably to them, saying,

032:007 Be strong and courageous, be not afraid nor dismayed for the
        king of Assyria, nor for all the multitude that is with him:
        for there be more with us than with him:

032:008 With him is an arm of flesh; but with us is the LORD our God
        to help us, and to fight our battles. And the people rested
        themselves upon the words of Hezekiah king of Judah.

032:009 After this did Sennacherib king of Assyria send his servants
        to Jerusalem, (but he himself laid siege against Lachish, and
        all his power with him,) unto Hezekiah king of Judah, and unto
        all Judah that were at Jerusalem, saying,

032:010 Thus saith Sennacherib king of Assyria, Whereon do ye trust,
        that ye abide in the siege in Jerusalem?

032:011 Doth not Hezekiah persuade you to give over yourselves to die
        by famine and by thirst, saying, The LORD our God shall
        deliver us out of the hand of the king of Assyria?

032:012 Hath not the same Hezekiah taken away his high places and his
        altars, and commanded Judah and Jerusalem, saying, Ye shall
        worship before one altar, and burn incense upon it?

032:013 Know ye not what I and my fathers have done unto all the
        people of other lands? were the gods of the nations of those
        lands any ways able to deliver their lands out of mine hand?

032:014 Who was there among all the gods of those nations that my
        fathers utterly destroyed, that could deliver his people out
        of mine hand, that your God should be able to deliver you out
        of mine hand?

032:015 Now therefore let not Hezekiah deceive you, nor persuade you
        on this manner, neither yet believe him: for no god of any
        nation or kingdom was able to deliver his people out of mine
        hand, and out of the hand of my fathers: how much less shall
        your God deliver you out of mine hand?

032:016 And his servants spake yet more against the LORD God, and
        against his servant Hezekiah.

032:017 He wrote also letters to rail on the LORD God of Israel, and
        to speak against him, saying, As the gods of the nations of
        other lands have not delivered their people out of mine hand,
        so shall not the God of Hezekiah deliver his people out of
        mine hand.

032:018 Then they cried with a loud voice in the Jews' speech unto the
        people of Jerusalem that were on the wall, to affright them,
        and to trouble them; that they might take the city.

032:019 And they spake against the God of Jerusalem, as against the
        gods of the people of the earth, which were the work of the
        hands of man.

032:020 And for this cause Hezekiah the king, and the prophet Isaiah
        the son of Amoz, prayed and cried to heaven.

032:021 And the LORD sent an angel, which cut off all the mighty men
        of valour, and the leaders and captains in the camp of the
        king of Assyria. So he returned with shame of face to his own
        land. And when he was come into the house of his god, they
        that came forth of his own bowels slew him there with the
        sword.

032:022 Thus the LORD saved Hezekiah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem
        from the hand of Sennacherib the king of Assyria, and from the
        hand of all other, and guided them on every side.

032:023 And many brought gifts unto the LORD to Jerusalem, and
        presents to Hezekiah king of Judah: so that he was magnified
        in the sight of all nations from thenceforth.

032:024 In those days Hezekiah was sick to the death, and prayed unto
        the LORD: and he spake unto him, and he gave him a sign.

032:025 But Hezekiah rendered not again according to the benefit done
        unto him; for his heart was lifted up: therefore there was
        wrath upon him, and upon Judah and Jerusalem.

032:026 Notwithstanding Hezekiah humbled himself for the pride of his
        heart, both he and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that the
        wrath of the LORD came not upon them in the days of Hezekiah.

032:027 And Hezekiah had exceeding much riches and honour: and he made
        himself treasuries for silver, and for gold, and for precious
        stones, and for spices, and for shields, and for all manner of
        pleasant jewels;

032:028 Storehouses also for the increase of corn, and wine, and oil;
        and stalls for all manner of beasts, and cotes for flocks.

032:029 Moreover he provided him cities, and possessions of flocks and
        herds in abundance: for God had given him substance very much.

032:030 This same Hezekiah also stopped the upper watercourse of
        Gihon, and brought it straight down to the west side of the
        city of David. And Hezekiah prospered in all his works.

032:031 Howbeit in the business of the ambassadors of the princes of
        Babylon, who sent unto him to enquire of the wonder that was
        done in the land, God left him, to try him, that he might know
        all that was in his heart.

032:032 Now the rest of the acts of Hezekiah, and his goodness,
        behold, they are written in the vision of Isaiah the prophet,
        the son of Amoz, and in the book of the kings of Judah and
        Israel.

032:033 And Hezekiah slept with his fathers, and they buried him in
        the chiefest of the sepulchres of the sons of David: and all
        Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem did him honour at his
        death. And Manasseh his son reigned in his stead.

033:001 Manasseh was twelve years old when he began to reign, and he
        reigned fifty and five years in Jerusalem:

033:002 But did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, like
        unto the abominations of the heathen, whom the LORD had cast
        out before the children of Israel.

033:003 For he built again the high places which Hezekiah his father
        had broken down, and he reared up altars for Baalim, and made
        groves, and worshipped all the host of heaven, and served
        them.

033:004 Also he built altars in the house of the LORD, whereof the
        LORD had said, In Jerusalem shall my name be for ever.

033:005 And he built altars for all the host of heaven in the two
        courts of the house of the LORD.

033:006 And he caused his children to pass through the fire in the
        valley of the son of Hinnom: also he observed times, and used
        enchantments, and used witchcraft, and dealt with a familiar
        spirit, and with wizards: he wrought much evil in the sight of
        the LORD, to provoke him to anger.

033:007 And he set a carved image, the idol which he had made, in the
        house of God, of which God had said to David and to Solomon
        his son, In this house, and in Jerusalem, which I have chosen
        before all the tribes of Israel, will I put my name for ever:

033:008 Neither will I any more remove the foot of Israel from out of
        the land which I have appointed for your fathers; so that they
        will take heed to do all that I have commanded them, according
        to the whole law and the statutes and the ordinances by the
        hand of Moses.

033:009 So Manasseh made Judah and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to
        err, and to do worse than the heathen, whom the LORD had
        destroyed before the children of Israel.

033:010 And the LORD spake to Manasseh, and to his people: but they
        would not hearken.

033:011 Wherefore the LORD brought upon them the captains of the host
        of the king of Assyria, which took Manasseh among the thorns,
        and bound him with fetters, and carried him to Babylon.

033:012 And when he was in affliction, he besought the LORD his God,
        and humbled himself greatly before the God of his fathers,

033:013 And prayed unto him: and he was intreated of him, and heard
        his supplication, and brought him again to Jerusalem into his
        kingdom. Then Manasseh knew that the LORD he was God.

033:014 Now after this he built a wall without the city of David, on
        the west side of Gihon, in the valley, even to the entering in
        at the fish gate, and compassed about Ophel, and raised it up
        a very great height, and put captains of war in all the fenced
        cities of Judah.

033:015 And he took away the strange gods, and the idol out of the
        house of the LORD, and all the altars that he had built in the
        mount of the house of the LORD, and in Jerusalem, and cast
        them out of the city.

033:016 And he repaired the altar of the LORD, and sacrificed thereon
        peace offerings and thank offerings, and commanded Judah to
        serve the LORD God of Israel.

033:017 Nevertheless the people did sacrifice still in the high
        places, yet unto the LORD their God only.

033:018 Now the rest of the acts of Manasseh, and his prayer unto his
        God, and the words of the seers that spake to him in the name
        of the LORD God of Israel, behold, they are written in the
        book of the kings of Israel.

033:019 His prayer also, and how God was intreated of him, and all his
        sins, and his trespass, and the places wherein he built high
        places, and set up groves and graven images, before he was
        humbled: behold, they are written among the sayings of the
        seers.

033:020 So Manasseh slept with his fathers, and they buried him in his
        own house: and Amon his son reigned in his stead.

033:021 Amon was two and twenty years old when he began to reign, and
        reigned two years in Jerusalem.

033:022 But he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD, as
        did Manasseh his father: for Amon sacrificed unto all the
        carved images which Manasseh his father had made, and served
        them;

033:023 And humbled not himself before the LORD, as Manasseh his
        father had humbled himself; but Amon trespassed more and more.

033:024 And his servants conspired against him, and slew him in his
        own house.

033:025 But the people of the land slew all them that had conspired
        against king Amon; and the people of the land made Josiah his
        son king in his stead.

034:001 Josiah was eight years old when he began to reign, and he
        reigned in Jerusalem one and thirty years.

034:002 And he did that which was right in the sight of the LORD, and
        walked in the ways of David his father, and declined neither
        to the right hand, nor to the left.

034:003 For in the eighth year of his reign, while he was yet young,
        he began to seek after the God of David his father: and in the
        twelfth year he began to purge Judah and Jerusalem from the
        high places, and the groves, and the carved images, and the
        molten images.

034:004 And they brake down the altars of Baalim in his presence; and
        the images, that were on high above them, he cut down; and the
        groves, and the carved images, and the molten images, he brake
        in pieces, and made dust of them, and strowed it upon the
        graves of them that had sacrificed unto them.

034:005 And he burnt the bones of the priests upon their altars, and
        cleansed Judah and Jerusalem.

034:006 And so did he in the cities of Manasseh, and Ephraim, and
        Simeon, even unto Naphtali, with their mattocks round about.

034:007 And when he had broken down the altars and the groves, and had
        beaten the graven images into powder, and cut down all the
        idols throughout all the land of Israel, he returned to
        Jerusalem.

034:008 Now in the eighteenth year of his reign, when he had purged
        the land, and the house, he sent Shaphan the son of Azaliah,
        and Maaseiah the governor of the city, and Joah the son of
        Joahaz the recorder, to repair the house of the LORD his God.

034:009 And when they came to Hilkiah the high priest, they delivered
        the money that was brought into the house of God, which the
        Levites that kept the doors had gathered of the hand of
        Manasseh and Ephraim, and of all the remnant of Israel, and of
        all Judah and Benjamin; and they returned to Jerusalem.

034:010 And they put it in the hand of the workmen that had the
        oversight of the house of the LORD, and they gave it to the
        workmen that wrought in the house of the LORD, to repair and
        amend the house:

034:011 Even to the artificers and builders gave they it, to buy hewn
        stone, and timber for couplings, and to floor the houses which
        the kings of Judah had destroyed.

034:012 And the men did the work faithfully: and the overseers of them
        were Jahath and Obadiah, the Levites, of the sons of Merari;
        and Zechariah and Meshullam, of the sons of the Kohathites, to
        set it forward; and other of the Levites, all that could skill
        of instruments of musick.

034:013 Also they were over the bearers of burdens, and were overseers
        of all that wrought the work in any manner of service: and of
        the Levites there were scribes, and officers, and porters.

034:014 And when they brought out the money that was brought into the
        house of the LORD, Hilkiah the priest found a book of the law
        of the LORD given by Moses.

034:015 And Hilkiah answered and said to Shaphan the scribe, I have
        found the book of the law in the house of the LORD. And
        Hilkiah delivered the book to Shaphan.

034:016 And Shaphan carried the book to the king, and brought the king
        word back again, saying, All that was committed to thy
        servants, they do it.

034:017 And they have gathered together the money that was found in
        the house of the LORD, and have delivered it into the hand of
        the overseers, and to the hand of the workmen.

034:018 Then Shaphan the scribe told the king, saying, Hilkiah the
        priest hath given me a book. And Shaphan read it before the
        king.

034:019 And it came to pass, when the king had heard the words of the
        law, that he rent his clothes.

034:020 And the king commanded Hilkiah, and Ahikam the son of Shaphan,
        and Abdon the son of Micah, and Shaphan the scribe, and Asaiah
        a servant of the king's, saying,

034:021 Go, enquire of the LORD for me, and for them that are left in
        Israel and in Judah, concerning the words of the book that is
        found: for great is the wrath of the LORD that is poured out
        upon us, because our fathers have not kept the word of the
        LORD, to do after all that is written in this book.

034:022 And Hilkiah, and they that the king had appointed, went to
        Huldah the prophetess, the wife of Shallum the son of Tikvath,
        the son of Hasrah, keeper of the wardrobe; (now she dwelt in
        Jerusalem in the college:) and they spake to her to that
        effect.

034:023 And she answered them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, Tell
        ye the man that sent you to me,

034:024 Thus saith the LORD, Behold, I will bring evil upon this
        place, and upon the inhabitants thereof, even all the curses
        that are written in the book which they have read before the
        king of Judah:

034:025 Because they have forsaken me, and have burned incense unto
        other gods, that they might provoke me to anger with all the
        works of their hands; therefore my wrath shall be poured out
        upon this place, and shall not be quenched.

034:026 And as for the king of Judah, who sent you to enquire of the
        LORD, so shall ye say unto him, Thus saith the LORD God of
        Israel concerning the words which thou hast heard;

034:027 Because thine heart was tender, and thou didst humble thyself
        before God, when thou heardest his words against this place,
        and against the inhabitants thereof, and humbledst thyself
        before me, and didst rend thy clothes, and weep before me; I
        have even heard thee also, saith the LORD.

034:028 Behold, I will gather thee to thy fathers, and thou shalt be
        gathered to thy grave in peace, neither shall thine eyes see
        all the evil that I will bring upon this place, and upon the
        inhabitants of the same. So they brought the king word again.

034:029 Then the king sent and gathered together all the elders of
        Judah and Jerusalem.

034:030 And the king went up into the house of the LORD, and all the
        men of Judah, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and the
        priests, and the Levites, and all the people, great and small:
        and he read in their ears all the words of the book of the
        covenant that was found in the house of the LORD.

034:031 And the king stood in his place, and made a covenant before
        the LORD, to walk after the LORD, and to keep his
        commandments, and his testimonies, and his statutes, with all
        his heart, and with all his soul, to perform the words of the
        covenant which are written in this book.

034:032 And he caused all that were present in Jerusalem and Benjamin
        to stand to it. And the inhabitants of Jerusalem did according
        to the covenant of God, the God of their fathers.

034:033 And Josiah took away all the abominations out of all the
        countries that pertained to the children of Israel, and made
        all that were present in Israel to serve, even to serve the
        LORD their God. And all his days they departed not from
        following the LORD, the God of their fathers.

035:001 Moreover Josiah kept a passover unto the LORD in Jerusalem:
        and they killed the passover on the fourteenth day of the
        first month.

035:002 And he set the priests in their charges, and encouraged them
        to the service of the house of the LORD,

035:003 And said unto the Levites that taught all Israel, which were
        holy unto the LORD, Put the holy ark in the house which
        Solomon the son of David king of Israel did build; it shall
        not be a burden upon your shoulders: serve now the LORD your
        God, and his people Israel,

035:004 And prepare yourselves by the houses of your fathers, after
        your courses, according to the writing of David king of
        Israel, and according to the writing of Solomon his son.

035:005 And stand in the holy place according to the divisions of the
        families of the fathers of your brethren the people, and after
        the division of the families of the Levites.

035:006 So kill the passover, and sanctify yourselves, and prepare
        your brethren, that they may do according to the word of the
        LORD by the hand of Moses.

035:007 And Josiah gave to the people, of the flock, lambs and kids,
        all for the passover offerings, for all that were present, to
        the number of thirty thousand, and three thousand bullocks:
        these were of the king's substance.

035:008 And his princes gave willingly unto the people, to the
        priests, and to the Levites: Hilkiah and Zechariah and Jehiel,
        rulers of the house of God, gave unto the priests for the
        passover offerings two thousand and six hundred small cattle
        and three hundred oxen.

035:009 Conaniah also, and Shemaiah and Nethaneel, his brethren, and
        Hashabiah and Jeiel and Jozabad, chief of the Levites, gave
        unto the Levites for passover offerings five thousand small
        cattle, and five hundred oxen.

035:010 So the service was prepared, and the priests stood in their
        place, and the Levites in their courses, according to the
        king's commandment.

035:011 And they killed the passover, and the priests sprinkled the
        blood from their hands, and the Levites flayed them.

035:012 And they removed the burnt offerings, that they might give
        according to the divisions of the families of the people, to
        offer unto the LORD, as it is written in the book of Moses.
        And so did they with the oxen.

035:013 And they roasted the passover with fire according to the
        ordinance: but the other holy offerings sod they in pots, and
        in caldrons, and in pans, and divided them speedily among all
        the people.

035:014 And afterward they made ready for themselves, and for the
        priests: because the priests the sons of Aaron were busied in
        offering of burnt offerings and the fat until night; therefore
        the Levites prepared for themselves, and for the priests the
        sons of Aaron.

035:015 And the singers the sons of Asaph were in their place,
        according to the commandment of David, and Asaph, and Heman,
        and Jeduthun the king's seer; and the porters waited at every
        gate; they might not depart from their service; for their
        brethren the Levites prepared for them.

035:016 So all the service of the LORD was prepared the same day, to
        keep the passover, and to offer burnt offerings upon the altar
        of the LORD, according to the commandment of king Josiah.

035:017 And the children of Israel that were present kept the passover
        at that time, and the feast of unleavened bread seven days.

035:018 And there was no passover like to that kept in Israel from the
        days of Samuel the prophet; neither did all the kings of
        Israel keep such a passover as Josiah kept, and the priests,
        and the Levites, and all Judah and Israel that were present,
        and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.

035:019 In the eighteenth year of the reign of Josiah was this
        passover kept.

035:020 After all this, when Josiah had prepared the temple, Necho
        king of Egypt came up to fight against Charchemish by
        Euphrates: and Josiah went out against him.

035:021 But he sent ambassadors to him, saying, What have I to do with
        thee, thou king of Judah? I come not against thee this day,
        but against the house wherewith I have war: for God commanded
        me to make haste: forbear thee from meddling with God, who is
        with me, that he destroy thee not.

035:022 Nevertheless Josiah would not turn his face from him, but
        disguised himself, that he might fight with him, and hearkened
        not unto the words of Necho from the mouth of God, and came to
        fight in the valley of Megiddo.

035:023 And the archers shot at king Josiah; and the king said to his
        servants, Have me away; for I am sore wounded.

035:024 His servants therefore took him out of that chariot, and put
        him in the second chariot that he had; and they brought him to
        Jerusalem, and he died, and was buried in one of the
        sepulchres of his fathers. And all Judah and Jerusalem mourned
        for Josiah.

035:025 And Jeremiah lamented for Josiah: and all the singing men and
        the singing women spake of Josiah in their lamentations to
        this day, and made them an ordinance in Israel: and, behold,
        they are written in the lamentations.

035:026 Now the rest of the acts of Josiah, and his goodness,
        according to that which was written in the law of the LORD,

035:027 And his deeds, first and last, behold, they are written in the
        book of the kings of Israel and Judah.

036:001 Then the people of the land took Jehoahaz the son of Josiah,
        and made him king in his father's stead in Jerusalem.

036:002 Jehoahaz was twenty and three years old when he began to
        reign, and he reigned three months in Jerusalem.

036:003 And the king of Egypt put him down at Jerusalem, and condemned
        the land in an hundred talents of silver and a talent of gold.

036:004 And the king of Egypt made Eliakim his brother king over Judah
        and Jerusalem, and turned his name to Jehoiakim. And Necho
        took Jehoahaz his brother, and carried him to Egypt.

036:005 Jehoiakim was twenty and five years old when he began to
        reign, and he reigned eleven years in Jerusalem: and he did
        that which was evil in the sight of the LORD his God.

036:006 Against him came up Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, and bound
        him in fetters, to carry him to Babylon.

036:007 Nebuchadnezzar also carried of the vessels of the house of the
        LORD to Babylon, and put them in his temple at Babylon.

036:008 Now the rest of the acts of Jehoiakim, and his abominations
        which he did, and that which was found in him, behold, they
        are written in the book of the kings of Israel and Judah: and
        Jehoiachin his son reigned in his stead.

036:009 Jehoiachin was eight years old when he began to reign, and he
        reigned three months and ten days in Jerusalem: and he did
        that which was evil in the sight of the LORD.

036:010 And when the year was expired, king Nebuchadnezzar sent, and
        brought him to Babylon, with the goodly vessels of the house
        of the LORD, and made Zedekiah his brother king over Judah and
        Jerusalem.

036:011 Zedekiah was one and twenty years old when he began to reign,
        and reigned eleven years in Jerusalem.

036:012 And he did that which was evil in the sight of the LORD his
        God, and humbled not himself before Jeremiah the prophet
        speaking from the mouth of the LORD.

036:013 And he also rebelled against king Nebuchadnezzar, who had made
        him swear by God: but he stiffened his neck, and hardened his
        heart from turning unto the LORD God of Israel.

036:014 Moreover all the chief of the priests, and the people,
        transgressed very much after all the abominations of the
        heathen; and polluted the house of the LORD which he had
        hallowed in Jerusalem.

036:015 And the LORD God of their fathers sent to them by his
        messengers, rising up betimes, and sending; because he had
        compassion on his people, and on his dwelling place:

036:016 But they mocked the messengers of God, and despised his words,
        and misused his prophets, until the wrath of the LORD arose
        against his people, till there was no remedy.

036:017 Therefore he brought upon them the king of the Chaldees, who
        slew their young men with the sword in the house of their
        sanctuary, and had no compassion upon young man or maiden, old
        man, or him that stooped for age: he gave them all into his
        hand.

036:018 And all the vessels of the house of God, great and small, and
        the treasures of the house of the LORD, and the treasures of
        the king, and of his princes; all these he brought to Babylon.

036:019 And they burnt the house of God, and brake down the wall of
        Jerusalem, and burnt all the palaces thereof with fire, and
        destroyed all the goodly vessels thereof.

036:020 And them that had escaped from the sword carried he away to
        Babylon; where they were servants to him and his sons until
        the reign of the kingdom of Persia:

036:021 To fulfil the word of the LORD by the mouth of Jeremiah, until
        the land had enjoyed her sabbaths: for as long as she lay
        desolate she kept sabbath, to fulfil threescore and ten years.

036:022 Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, that the word
        of the LORD spoken by the mouth of Jeremiah might be
        accomplished, the LORD stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of
        Persia, that he made a proclamation throughout all his
        kingdom, and put it also in writing, saying,

036:023 Thus saith Cyrus king of Persia, All the kingdoms of the earth
        hath the LORD God of heaven given me; and he hath charged me
        to build him an house in Jerusalem, which is in Judah. Who is
        there among you of all his people? The LORD his God be with
        him, and let him go up.

Book 15	Ezra

001:001 Now in the first year of Cyrus king of Persia, that the word
        of the LORD by the mouth of Jeremiah might be fulfilled, the
        LORD stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia, that he
        made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom, and put it
        also in writing, saying,

001:002 Thus saith Cyrus king of Persia, The LORD God of heaven hath
        given me all the kingdoms of the earth; and he hath charged me
        to build him an house at Jerusalem, which is in Judah.

001:003 Who is there among you of all his people? his God be with him,
        and let him go up to Jerusalem, which is in Judah, and build
        the house of the LORD God of Israel, (he is the God,) which is
        in Jerusalem.

001:004 And whosoever remaineth in any place where he sojourneth, let
        the men of his place help him with silver, and with gold, and
        with goods, and with beasts, beside the freewill offering for
        the house of God that is in Jerusalem.

001:005 Then rose up the chief of the fathers of Judah and Benjamin,
        and the priests, and the Levites, with all them whose spirit
        God had raised, to go up to build the house of the LORD which
        is in Jerusalem.

001:006 And all they that were about them strengthened their hands
        with vessels of silver, with gold, with goods, and with
        beasts, and with precious things, beside all that was
        willingly offered.

001:007 Also Cyrus the king brought forth the vessels of the house of
        the LORD, which Nebuchadnezzar had brought forth out of
        Jerusalem, and had put them in the house of his gods;

001:008 Even those did Cyrus king of Persia bring forth by the hand of
        Mithredath the treasurer, and numbered them unto Sheshbazzar,
        the prince of Judah.

001:009 And this is the number of them: thirty chargers of gold, a
        thousand chargers of silver, nine and twenty knives,

001:010 Thirty basons of gold, silver basons of a second sort four
        hundred and ten, and other vessels a thousand.

001:011 All the vessels of gold and of silver were five thousand and
        four hundred. All these did Sheshbazzar bring up with them of
        the captivity that were brought up from Babylon unto
        Jerusalem.

002:001 Now these are the children of the province that went up out of
        the captivity, of those which had been carried away, whom
        Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away unto
        Babylon, and came again unto Jerusalem and Judah, every one
        unto his city;

002:002 Which came with Zerubbabel: Jeshua, Nehemiah, Seraiah,
        Reelaiah, Mordecai, Bilshan, Mizpar, Bigvai, Rehum, Baanah.
        The number of the men of the people of Israel:

002:015 The children of Adin, four hundred fifty and four.

002:016 The children of Ater of Hezekiah, ninety and eight.

002:017 The children of Bezai, three hundred twenty and three.

002:031 The children of the other Elam, a thousand two hundred fifty
        and four.

002:032 The children of Harim, three hundred and twenty.

002:033 The children of Lod, Hadid, and Ono, seven hundred twenty and
        five.

002:034 The children of Jericho, three hundred forty and five.

002:035 The children of Senaah, three thousand and six hundred and
        thirty.

002:036 The priests: the children of Jedaiah, of the house of Jeshua,
        nine hundred seventy and three.

002:037 The children of Immer, a thousand fifty and two.

002:038 The children of Pashur, a thousand two hundred forty and

        Akkub, the children of Hatita, the children of Shobai, in all
        an hundred thirty and nine.

002:043 The Nethinims: the children of Ziha, the children of Hasupha,
        the children of Tabbaoth,

002:044 The children of Keros, the children of Siaha, the children of
        Padon,

002:045 The children of Lebanah, the children of Hagabah, the children
        of Akkub,

002:046 The children of Hagab, the children of Shalmai, the children
        of Hanan,

002:047 The children of Giddel, the children of Gahar, the children of
        Reaiah,

002:048 The children of Rezin, the children of Nekoda, the children of
        Gazzam,

002:049 The children of Uzza, the children of Paseah, the children of
        Besai,

002:050 The children of Asnah, the children of Mehunim, the children
        of Nephusim,

002:051 The children of Bakbuk, the children of Hakupha, the children
        of Harhur,

002:052 The children of Bazluth, the children of Mehida, the children
        of Harsha,

002:053 The children of Barkos, the children of Sisera, the children
        of Thamah,

002:054 The children of Neziah, the children of Hatipha.

002:055 The children of Solomon's servants: the children of Sotai, the
        children of Sophereth, the children of Peruda,

002:056 The children of Jaalah, the children of Darkon, the children
        of Giddel,

002:057 The children of Shephatiah, the children of Hattil, the
        children of Pochereth of Zebaim, the children of Ami.

002:058 All the Nethinims, and the children of Solomon's servants,
        were three hundred ninety and two.

002:059 And these were they which went up from Telmelah, Telharsa,
        Cherub, Addan, and Immer: but they could not shew their
        father's house, and their seed, whether they were of Israel:

002:060 The children of Delaiah, the children of Tobiah, the children
        of Nekoda, six hundred fifty and two.

002:061 And of the children of the priests: the children of Habaiah,
        the children of Koz, the children of Barzillai; which took a
        wife of the daughters of Barzillai the Gileadite, and was
        called after their name:

002:062 These sought their register among those that were reckoned by
        genealogy, but they were not found: therefore were they, as
        polluted, put from the priesthood.

002:063 And the Tirshatha said unto them, that they should not eat of
        the most holy things, till there stood up a priest with Urim
        and with Thummim.

002:064 The whole congregation together was forty and two thousand
        three hundred and threescore,

002:065 Beside their servants and their maids, of whom there were
        seven thousand three hundred thirty and seven: and there were
        among them two hundred singing men and singing women.

002:066 Their horses were seven hundred thirty and six; their mules,
        two hundred forty and five;

002:067 Their camels, four hundred thirty and five; their asses, six
        thousand seven hundred and twenty.

002:068 And some of the chief of the fathers, when they came to the
        house of the LORD which is at Jerusalem, offered freely for
        the house of God to set it up in his place:

002:069 They gave after their ability unto the treasure of the work
        threescore and one thousand drams of gold, and five thousand
        pound of silver, and one hundred priests' garments.

002:070 So the priests, and the Levites, and some of the people, and
        the singers, and the porters, and the Nethinims, dwelt in
        their cities, and all Israel in their cities.

003:001 And when the seventh month was come, and the children of
        Israel were in the cities, the people gathered themselves
        together as one man to Jerusalem.

003:002 Then stood up Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and his brethren the
        priests, and Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and his
        brethren, and builded the altar of the God of Israel, to offer
        burnt offerings thereon, as it is written in the law of Moses
        the man of God.

003:003 And they set the altar upon his bases; for fear was upon them
        because of the people of those countries: and they offered
        burnt offerings thereon unto the LORD, even burnt offerings
        morning and evening.

003:004 They kept also the feast of tabernacles, as it is written, and
        offered the daily burnt offerings by number, according to the
        custom, as the duty of every day required;

003:005 And afterward offered the continual burnt offering, both of
        the new moons, and of all the set feasts of the LORD that were
        consecrated, and of every one that willingly offered a
        freewill offering unto the LORD.

003:006 From the first day of the seventh month began they to offer
        burnt offerings unto the LORD. But the foundation of the
        temple of the LORD was not yet laid.

003:007 They gave money also unto the masons, and to the carpenters;
        and meat, and drink, and oil, unto them of Zidon, and to them
        of Tyre, to bring cedar trees from Lebanon to the sea of
        Joppa, according to the grant that they had of Cyrus king of
        Persia.

003:008 Now in the second year of their coming unto the house of God
        at Jerusalem, in the second month, began Zerubbabel the son of
        Shealtiel, and Jeshua the son of Jozadak, and the remnant of
        their brethren the priests and the Levites, and all they that
        were come out of the captivity unto Jerusalem; and appointed
        the Levites, from twenty years old and upward, to set forward
        the work of the house of the LORD.

003:009 Then stood Jeshua with his sons and his brethren, Kadmiel and
        his sons, the sons of Judah, together, to set forward the
        workmen in the house of God: the sons of Henadad, with their
        sons and their brethren the Levites.

003:010 And when the builders laid the foundation of the temple of the
        LORD, they set the priests in their apparel with trumpets, and
        the Levites the sons of Asaph with cymbals, to praise the
        LORD, after the ordinance of David king of Israel.

003:011 And they sang together by course in praising and giving thanks
        unto the LORD; because he is good, for his mercy endureth for
        ever toward Israel. And all the people shouted with a great
        shout, when they praised the LORD, because the foundation of
        the house of the LORD was laid.

003:012 But many of the priests and Levites and chief of the fathers,
        who were ancient men, that had seen the first house, when the
        foundation of this house was laid before their eyes, wept with
        a loud voice; and many shouted aloud for joy:

003:013 So that the people could not discern the noise of the shout of
        joy from the noise of the weeping of the people: for the
        people shouted with a loud shout, and the noise was heard afar
        off.

004:001 Now when the adversaries of Judah and Benjamin heard that the
        children of the captivity builded the temple unto the LORD God
        of Israel;

004:002 Then they came to Zerubbabel, and to the chief of the fathers,
        and said unto them, Let us build with you: for we seek your
        God, as ye do; and we do sacrifice unto him since the days of
        Esarhaddon king of Assur, which brought us up hither.

004:003 But Zerubbabel, and Jeshua, and the rest of the chief of the
        fathers of Israel, said unto them, Ye have nothing to do with
        us to build an house unto our God; but we ourselves together
        will build unto the LORD God of Israel, as king Cyrus the king
        of Persia hath commanded us.

004:004 Then the people of the land weakened the hands of the people
        of Judah, and troubled them in building,

004:005 And hired counsellors against them, to frustrate their
        purpose, all the days of Cyrus king of Persia, even until the
        reign of Darius king of Persia.

004:006 And in the reign of Ahasuerus, in the beginning of his reign,
        wrote they unto him an accusation against the inhabitants of
        Judah and Jerusalem.

004:007 And in the days of Artaxerxes wrote Bishlam, Mithredath,
        Tabeel, and the rest of their companions, unto Artaxerxes king
        of Persia; and the writing of the letter was written in the
        Syrian tongue, and interpreted in the Syrian tongue.

004:008 Rehum the chancellor and Shimshai the scribe wrote a letter
        against Jerusalem to Artaxerxes the king in this sort:

004:009 Then wrote Rehum the chancellor, and Shimshai the scribe, and
        the rest of their companions; the Dinaites, the
        Apharsathchites, the Tarpelites, the Apharsites, the
        Archevites, the Babylonians, the Susanchites, the Dehavites,
        and the Elamites,

004:010 And the rest of the nations whom the great and noble Asnapper
        brought over, and set in the cities of Samaria, and the rest
        that are on this side the river, and at such a time.

004:011 This is the copy of the letter that they sent unto him, even
        unto Artaxerxes the king; Thy servants the men on this side
        the river, and at such a time.

004:012 Be it known unto the king, that the Jews which came up from
        thee to us are come unto Jerusalem, building the rebellious
        and the bad city, and have set up the walls thereof, and
        joined the foundations.

004:013 Be it known now unto the king, that, if this city be builded,
        and the walls set up again, then will they not pay toll,
        tribute, and custom, and so thou shalt endamage the revenue of
        the kings.

004:014 Now because we have maintenance from the king's palace, and it
        was not meet for us to see the king's dishonour, therefore
        have we sent and certified the king;

004:015 That search may be made in the book of the records of thy
        fathers: so shalt thou find in the book of the records, and
        know that this city is a rebellious city, and hurtful unto
        kings and provinces, and that they have moved sedition within
        the same of old time: for which cause was this city destroyed.

004:016 We certify the king that, if this city be builded again, and
        the walls thereof set up, by this means thou shalt have no
        portion on this side the river.

004:017 Then sent the king an answer unto Rehum the chancellor, and to
        Shimshai the scribe, and to the rest of their companions that
        dwell in Samaria, and unto the rest beyond the river, Peace,
        and at such a time.

004:018 The letter which ye sent unto us hath been plainly read before
        me.

004:019 And I commanded, and search hath been made, and it is found
        that this city of old time hath made insurrection against
        kings, and that rebellion and sedition have been made therein.

004:020 There have been mighty kings also over Jerusalem, which have
        ruled over all countries beyond the river; and toll, tribute,
        and custom, was paid unto them.

004:021 Give ye now commandment to cause these men to cease, and that
        this city be not builded, until another commandment shall be
        given from me.

004:022 Take heed now that ye fail not to do this: why should damage
        grow to the hurt of the kings?

004:023 Now when the copy of king Artaxerxes' letter was read before
        Rehum, and Shimshai the scribe, and their companions, they
        went up in haste to Jerusalem unto the Jews, and made them to
        cease by force and power.

004:024 Then ceased the work of the house of God which is at
        Jerusalem. So it ceased unto the second year of the reign of
        Darius king of Persia.

005:001 Then the prophets, Haggai the prophet, and Zechariah the son
        of Iddo, prophesied unto the Jews that were in Judah and
        Jerusalem in the name of the God of Israel, even unto them.

005:002 Then rose up Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua the
        son of Jozadak, and began to build the house of God which is
        at Jerusalem: and with them were the prophets of God helping
        them.

005:003 At the same time came to them Tatnai, governor on this side
        the river, and Shetharboznai and their companions, and said
        thus unto them, Who hath commanded you to build this house,
        and to make up this wall?

005:004 Then said we unto them after this manner, What are the names
        of the men that make this building?

005:005 But the eye of their God was upon the elders of the Jews, that
        they could not cause them to cease, till the matter came to
        Darius: and then they returned answer by letter concerning
        this matter.

005:006 The copy of the letter that Tatnai, governor on this side the
        river, and Shetharboznai and his companions the Apharsachites,
        which were on this side the river, sent unto Darius the king:

005:007 They sent a letter unto him, wherein was written thus; Unto
        Darius the king, all peace.

005:008 Be it known unto the king, that we went into the province of
        Judea, to the house of the great God, which is builded with
        great stones, and timber is laid in the walls, and this work
        goeth fast on, and prospereth in their hands.

005:009 Then asked we those elders, and said unto them thus, Who
        commanded you to build this house, and to make up these walls?

005:010 We asked their names also, to certify thee, that we might
        write the names of the men that were the chief of them.

005:011 And thus they returned us answer, saying, We are the servants
        of the God of heaven and earth, and build the house that was
        builded these many years ago, which a great king of Israel
        builded and set up.

005:012 But after that our fathers had provoked the God of heaven unto
        wrath, he gave them into the hand of Nebuchadnezzar the king
        of Babylon, the Chaldean, who destroyed this house, and
        carried the people away into Babylon.

005:013 But in the first year of Cyrus the king of Babylon the same
        king Cyrus made a decree to build this house of God.

005:014 And the vessels also of gold and silver of the house of God,
        which Nebuchadnezzar took out of the temple that was in
        Jerusalem, and brought them into the temple of Babylon, those
        did Cyrus the king take out of the temple of Babylon, and they
        were delivered unto one, whose name was Sheshbazzar, whom he
        had made governor;

005:015 And said unto him, Take these vessels, go, carry them into the
        temple that is in Jerusalem, and let the house of God be
        builded in his place.

005:016 Then came the same Sheshbazzar, and laid the foundation of the
        house of God which is in Jerusalem: and since that time even
        until now hath it been in building, and yet it is not
        finished.

005:017 Now therefore, if it seem good to the king, let there be
        search made in the king's treasure house, which is there at
        Babylon, whether it be so, that a decree was made of Cyrus the
        king to build this house of God at Jerusalem, and let the king
        send his pleasure to us concerning this matter.

006:001 Then Darius the king made a decree, and search was made in the
        house of the rolls, where the treasures were laid up in
        Babylon.

006:002 And there was found at Achmetha, in the palace that is in the
        province of the Medes, a roll, and therein was a record thus
        written:

006:003 In the first year of Cyrus the king the same Cyrus the king
        made a decree concerning the house of God at Jerusalem, Let
        the house be builded, the place where they offered sacrifices,
        and let the foundations thereof be strongly laid; the height
        thereof threescore cubits, and the breadth thereof threescore
        cubits;

006:004 With three rows of great stones, and a row of new timber: and
        let the expenses be given out of the king's house:

006:005 And also let the golden and silver vessels of the house of
        God, which Nebuchadnezzar took forth out of the temple which
        is at Jerusalem, and brought unto Babylon, be restored, and
        brought again unto the temple which is at Jerusalem, every one
        to his place, and place them in the house of God.

006:006 Now therefore, Tatnai, governor beyond the river,
        Shetharboznai, and your companions the Apharsachites, which
        are beyond the river, be ye far from thence:

006:007 Let the work of this house of God alone; let the governor of
        the Jews and the elders of the Jews build this house of God in
        his place.

006:008 Moreover I make a decree what ye shall do to the elders of
        these Jews for the building of this house of God: that of the
        king's goods, even of the tribute beyond the river, forthwith
        expenses be given unto these men, that they be not hindered.

006:009 And that which they have need of, both young bullocks, and
        rams, and lambs, for the burnt offerings of the God of heaven,
        wheat, salt, wine, and oil, according to the appointment of
        the priests which are at Jerusalem, let it be given them day
        by day without fail:

006:010 That they may offer sacrifices of sweet savours unto the God
        of heaven, and pray for the life of the king, and of his sons.

006:011 Also I have made a decree, that whosoever shall alter this
        word, let timber be pulled down from his house, and being set
        up, let him be hanged thereon; and let his house be made a
        dunghill for this.

006:012 And the God that hath caused his name to dwell there destroy
        all kings and people, that shall put to their hand to alter
        and to destroy this house of God which is at Jerusalem. I
        Darius have made a decree; let it be done with speed.

006:013 Then Tatnai, governor on this side the river, Shetharboznai,
        and their companions, according to that which Darius the king
        had sent, so they did speedily.

006:014 And the elders of the Jews builded, and they prospered through
        the prophesying of Haggai the prophet and Zechariah the son of
        Iddo. And they builded, and finished it, according to the
        commandment of the God of Israel, and according to the
        commandment of Cyrus, and Darius, and Artaxerxes king of
        Persia.

006:015 And this house was finished on the third day of the month
        Adar, which was in the sixth year of the reign of Darius the
        king.

006:016 And the children of Israel, the priests, and the Levites, and
        the rest of the children of the captivity, kept the dedication
        of this house of God with joy.

006:017 And offered at the dedication of this house of God an hundred
        bullocks, two hundred rams, four hundred lambs; and for a sin
        offering for all Israel, twelve he goats, according to the
        number of the tribes of Israel.

006:018 And they set the priests in their divisions, and the Levites
        in their courses, for the service of God, which is at
        Jerusalem; as it is written in the book of Moses.

006:019 And the children of the captivity kept the passover upon the
        fourteenth day of the first month.

006:020 For the priests and the Levites were purified together, all of
        them were pure, and killed the passover for all the children
        of the captivity, and for their brethren the priests, and for
        themselves.

006:021 And the children of Israel, which were come again out of
        captivity, and all such as had separated themselves unto them
        from the filthiness of the heathen of the land, to seek the
        LORD God of Israel, did eat,

006:022 And kept the feast of unleavened bread seven days with joy:
        for the LORD had made them joyful, and turned the heart of the
        king of Assyria unto them, to strengthen their hands in the
        work of the house of God, the God of Israel.

007:001 Now after these things, in the reign of Artaxerxes king of
        Persia, Ezra the son of Seraiah, the son of Azariah, the son
        of Hilkiah,

007:002 The son of Shallum, the son of Zadok, the son of Ahitub,

007:003 The son of Amariah, the son of Azariah, the son of Meraioth,

007:004 The son of Zerahiah, the son of Uzzi, the son of Bukki,

007:005 The son of Abishua, the son of Phinehas, the son of Eleazar,
        the son of Aaron the chief priest:

007:006 This Ezra went up from Babylon; and he was a ready scribe in
        the law of Moses, which the LORD God of Israel had given: and
        the king granted him all his request, according to the hand of
        the LORD his God upon him.

007:007 And there went up some of the children of Israel, and of the
        priests, and the Levites, and the singers, and the porters,
        and the Nethinims, unto Jerusalem, in the seventh year of
        Artaxerxes the king.

007:008 And he came to Jerusalem in the fifth month, which was in the
        seventh year of the king.

007:009 For upon the first day of the first month began he to go up
        from Babylon, and on the first day of the fifth month came he
        to Jerusalem, according to the good hand of his God upon him.

007:010 For Ezra had prepared his heart to seek the law of the LORD,
        and to do it, and to teach in Israel statutes and judgments.

007:011 Now this is the copy of the letter that the king Artaxerxes
        gave unto Ezra the priest, the scribe, even a scribe of the
        words of the commandments of the LORD, and of his statutes to
        Israel.

007:012 Artaxerxes, king of kings, unto Ezra the priest, a scribe of
        the law of the God of heaven, perfect peace, and at such a
        time.

007:013 I make a decree, that all they of the people of Israel, and of
        his priests and Levites, in my realm, which are minded of
        their own freewill to go up to Jerusalem, go with thee.

007:014 Forasmuch as thou art sent of the king, and of his seven
        counsellors, to enquire concerning Judah and Jerusalem,
        according to the law of thy God which is in thine hand;

007:015 And to carry the silver and gold, which the king and his
        counsellors have freely offered unto the God of Israel, whose
        habitation is in Jerusalem,

007:016 And all the silver and gold that thou canst find in all the
        province of Babylon, with the freewill offering of the people,
        and of the priests, offering willingly for the house of their
        God which is in Jerusalem:

007:017 That thou mayest buy speedily with this money bullocks, rams,
        lambs, with their meat offerings and their drink offerings,
        and offer them upon the altar of the house of your God which
        is in Jerusalem.

007:018 And whatsoever shall seem good to thee, and to thy brethren,
        to do with the rest of the silver and the gold, that do after
        the will of your God.

007:019 The vessels also that are given thee for the service of the
        house of thy God, those deliver thou before the God of
        Jerusalem.

007:020 And whatsoever more shall be needful for the house of thy God,
        which thou shalt have occasion to bestow, bestow it out of the
        king's treasure house.

007:021 And I, even I Artaxerxes the king, do make a decree to all the
        treasurers which are beyond the river, that whatsoever Ezra
        the priest, the scribe of the law of the God of heaven, shall
        require of you, it be done speedily,

007:022 Unto an hundred talents of silver, and to an hundred measures
        of wheat, and to an hundred baths of wine, and to an hundred
        baths of oil, and salt without prescribing how much.

007:023 Whatsoever is commanded by the God of heaven, let it be
        diligently done for the house of the God of heaven: for why
        should there be wrath against the realm of the king and his
        sons?

007:024 Also we certify you, that touching any of the priests and
        Levites, singers, porters, Nethinims, or ministers of this
        house of God, it shall not be lawful to impose toll, tribute,
        or custom, upon them.

007:025 And thou, Ezra, after the wisdom of thy God, that is in thine
        hand, set magistrates and judges, which may judge all the
        people that are beyond the river, all such as know the laws of
        thy God; and teach ye them that know them not.

007:026 And whosoever will not do the law of thy God, and the law of
        the king, let judgment be executed speedily upon him, whether
        it be unto death, or to banishment, or to confiscation of
        goods, or to imprisonment.

007:027 Blessed be the LORD God of our fathers, which hath put such a
        thing as this in the king's heart, to beautify the house of
        the LORD which is in Jerusalem:

007:028 And hath extended mercy unto me before the king, and his
        counsellors, and before all the king's mighty princes. And I
        was strengthened as the hand of the LORD my God was upon me,
        and I gathered together out of Israel chief men to go up with
        me.

008:001 These are now the chief of their fathers, and this is the
        genealogy of them that went up with me from Babylon, in the
        reign of Artaxerxes the king.

008:002 Of the sons of Phinehas; Gershom: of the sons of Ithamar;
        Daniel: of the sons of David; Hattush.

008:003 Of the sons of Shechaniah, of the sons of Pharosh; Zechariah:
        and with him were reckoned by genealogy of the males an
        hundred and fifty.

008:004 Of the sons of Pahathmoab; Elihoenai the son of Zerahiah, and
        with him two hundred males.

008:005 Of the sons of Shechaniah; the son of Jahaziel, and with him
        three hundred males.

008:006 Of the sons also of Adin; Ebed the son of Jonathan, and with
        him fifty males.

008:007 And of the sons of Elam; Jeshaiah the son of Athaliah, and
        with him seventy males.

008:008 And of the sons of Shephatiah; Zebadiah the son of Michael,
        and with him fourscore males.

008:009 Of the sons of Joab; Obadiah the son of Jehiel, and with him
        two hundred and eighteen males.

008:010 And of the sons of Shelomith; the son of Josiphiah, and with
        him an hundred and threescore males.

008:011 And of the sons of Bebai; Zechariah the son of Bebai, and with
        him twenty and eight males.

008:012 And of the sons of Azgad; Johanan the son of Hakkatan, and
        with him an hundred and ten males.

008:013 And of the last sons of Adonikam, whose names are these,
        Eliphelet, Jeiel, and Shemaiah, and with them threescore
        males.

008:014 Of the sons also of Bigvai; Uthai, and Zabbud, and with them
        seventy males.

008:015 And I gathered them together to the river that runneth to
        Ahava; and there abode we in tents three days: and I viewed
        the people, and the priests, and found there none of the sons
        of Levi.

008:016 Then sent I for Eliezer, for Ariel, for Shemaiah, and for
        Elnathan, and for Jarib, and for Elnathan, and for Nathan, and
        for Zechariah, and for Meshullam, chief men; also for Joiarib,
        and for Elnathan, men of understanding.

008:017 And I sent them with commandment unto Iddo the chief at the
        place Casiphia, and I told them what they should say unto
        Iddo, and to his brethren the Nethinims, at the place
        Casiphia, that they should bring unto us ministers for the
        house of our God.

008:018 And by the good hand of our God upon us they brought us a man
        of understanding, of the sons of Mahli, the son of Levi, the
        son of Israel; and Sherebiah, with his sons and his brethren,
        eighteen;

008:019 And Hashabiah, and with him Jeshaiah of the sons of Merari,
        his brethren and their sons, twenty;

008:020 Also of the Nethinims, whom David and the princes had
        appointed for the service of the Levites, two hundred and
        twenty Nethinims: all of them were expressed by name.

008:021 Then I proclaimed a fast there, at the river of Ahava, that we
        might afflict ourselves before our God, to seek of him a right
        way for us, and for our little ones, and for all our
        substance.

008:022 For I was ashamed to require of the king a band of soldiers
        and horsemen to help us against the enemy in the way: because
        we had spoken unto the king, saying, The hand of our God is
        upon all them for good that seek him; but his power and his
        wrath is against all them that forsake him.

008:023 So we fasted and besought our God for this: and he was
        intreated of us.

008:024 Then I separated twelve of the chief of the priests,
        Sherebiah, Hashabiah, and ten of their brethren with them,

008:025 And weighed unto them the silver, and the gold, and the
        vessels, even the offering of the house of our God, which the
        king, and his counsellors, and his lords, and all Israel there
        present, had offered:

008:026 I even weighed unto their hand six hundred and fifty talents
        of silver, and silver vessels an hundred talents, and of gold
        an hundred talents;

008:027 Also twenty basons of gold, of a thousand drams; and two
        vessels of fine copper, precious as gold.

008:028 And I said unto them, Ye are holy unto the LORD; the vessels
        are holy also; and the silver and the gold are a freewill
        offering unto the LORD God of your fathers.

008:029 Watch ye, and keep them, until ye weigh them before the chief
        of the priests and the Levites, and chief of the fathers of
        Israel, at Jerusalem, in the chambers of the house of the
        LORD.

008:030 So took the priests and the Levites the weight of the silver,
        and the gold, and the vessels, to bring them to Jerusalem unto
        the house of our God.

008:031 Then we departed from the river of Ahava on the twelfth day of
        the first month, to go unto Jerusalem: and the hand of our God
        was upon us, and he delivered us from the hand of the enemy,
        and of such as lay in wait by the way.

008:032 And we came to Jerusalem, and abode there three days.

008:033 Now on the fourth day was the silver and the gold and the
        vessels weighed in the house of our God by the hand of
        Meremoth the son of Uriah the priest; and with him was Eleazar
        the son of Phinehas; and with them was Jozabad the son of
        Jeshua, and Noadiah the son of Binnui, Levites;

008:034 By number and by weight of every one: and all the weight was
        written at that time.

008:035 Also the children of those that had been carried away, which
        were come out of the captivity, offered burnt offerings unto
        the God of Israel, twelve bullocks for all Israel, ninety and
        six rams, seventy and seven lambs, twelve he goats for a sin
        offering: all this was a burnt offering unto the LORD.

008:036 And they delivered the king's commissions unto the king's
        lieutenants, and to the governors on this side the river: and
        they furthered the people, and the house of God.

009:001 Now when these things were done, the princes came to me,
        saying, The people of Israel, and the priests, and the
        Levites, have not separated themselves from the people of the
        lands, doing according to their abominations, even of the
        Canaanites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Jebusites, the
        Ammonites, the Moabites, the Egyptians, and the Amorites.

009:002 For they have taken of their daughters for themselves, and for
        their sons: so that the holy seed have mingled themselves with
        the people of those lands: yea, the hand of the princes and
        rulers hath been chief in this trespass.

009:003 And when I heard this thing, I rent my garment and my mantle,
        and plucked off the hair of my head and of my beard, and sat
        down astonied.

009:004 Then were assembled unto me every one that trembled at the
        words of the God of Israel, because of the transgression of
        those that had been carried away; and I sat astonied until the
        evening sacrifice.

009:005 And at the evening sacrifice I arose up from my heaviness; and
        having rent my garment and my mantle, I fell upon my knees,
        and spread out my hands unto the LORD my God,

009:006 And said, O my God, I am ashamed and blush to lift up my face
        to thee, my God: for our iniquities are increased over our
        head, and our trespass is grown up unto the heavens.

009:007 Since the days of our fathers have we been in a great trespass
        unto this day; and for our iniquities have we, our kings, and
        our priests, been delivered into the hand of the kings of the
        lands, to the sword, to captivity, and to a spoil, and to
        confusion of face, as it is this day.

009:008 And now for a little space grace hath been shewed from the
        LORD our God, to leave us a remnant to escape, and to give us
        a nail in his holy place, that our God may lighten our eyes,
        and give us a little reviving in our bondage.

009:009 For we were bondmen; yet our God hath not forsaken us in our
        bondage, but hath extended mercy unto us in the sight of the
        kings of Persia, to give us a reviving, to set up the house of
        our God, and to repair the desolations thereof, and to give us
        a wall in Judah and in Jerusalem.

009:010 And now, O our God, what shall we say after this? for we have
        forsaken thy commandments,

009:011 Which thou hast commanded by thy servants the prophets,
        saying, The land, unto which ye go to possess it, is an
        unclean land with the filthiness of the people of the lands,
        with their abominations, which have filled it from one end to
        another with their uncleanness.

009:012 Now therefore give not your daughters unto their sons, neither
        take their daughters unto your sons, nor seek their peace or
        their wealth for ever: that ye may be strong, and eat the good
        of the land, and leave it for an inheritance to your children
        for ever.

009:013 And after all that is come upon us for our evil deeds, and for
        our great trespass, seeing that thou our God hast punished us
        less than our iniquities deserve, and hast given us such
        deliverance as this;

009:014 Should we again break thy commandments, and join in affinity
        with the people of these abominations? wouldest not thou be
        angry with us till thou hadst consumed us, so that there
        should be no remnant nor escaping?

009:015 O LORD God of Israel, thou art righteous: for we remain yet
        escaped, as it is this day: behold, we are before thee in our
        trespasses: for we cannot stand before thee because of this.

010:001 Now when Ezra had prayed, and when he had confessed, weeping
        and casting himself down before the house of God, there
        assembled unto him out of Israel a very great congregation of
        men and women and children: for the people wept very sore.

010:002 And Shechaniah the son of Jehiel, one of the sons of Elam,
        answered and said unto Ezra, We have trespassed against our
        God, and have taken strange wives of the people of the land:
        yet now there is hope in Israel concerning this thing.

010:003 Now therefore let us make a covenant with our God to put away
        all the wives, and such as are born of them, according to the
        counsel of my lord, and of those that tremble at the
        commandment of our God; and let it be done according to the
        law.

010:004 Arise; for this matter belongeth unto thee: we also will be
        with thee: be of good courage, and do it.

010:005 Then arose Ezra, and made the chief priests, the Levites, and
        all Israel, to swear that they should do according to this
        word. And they sware.

010:006 Then Ezra rose up from before the house of God, and went into
        the chamber of Johanan the son of Eliashib: and when he came
        thither, he did eat no bread, nor drink water: for he mourned
        because of the transgression of them that had been carried
        away.

010:007 And they made proclamation throughout Judah and Jerusalem unto
        all the children of the captivity, that they should gather
        themselves together unto Jerusalem;

010:008 And that whosoever would not come within three days, according
        to the counsel of the princes and the elders, all his
        substance should be forfeited, and himself separated from the
        congregation of those that had been carried away.

010:009 Then all the men of Judah and Benjamin gathered themselves
        together unto Jerusalem within three days. It was the ninth
        month, on the twentieth day of the month; and all the people
        sat in the street of the house of God, trembling because of
        this matter, and for the great rain.

010:010 And Ezra the priest stood up, and said unto them, Ye have
        transgressed, and have taken strange wives, to increase the
        trespass of Israel.

010:011 Now therefore make confession unto the LORD God of your
        fathers, and do his pleasure: and separate yourselves from the
        people of the land, and from the strange wives.

010:012 Then all the congregation answered and said with a loud voice,
        As thou hast said, so must we do.

010:013 But the people are many, and it is a time of much rain, and we
        are not able to stand without, neither is this a work of one
        day or two: for we are many that have transgressed in this
        thing.

010:014 Let now our rulers of all the congregation stand, and let all
        them which have taken strange wives in our cities come at
        appointed times, and with them the elders of every city, and
        the judges thereof, until the fierce wrath of our God for this
        matter be turned from us.

010:015 Only Jonathan the son of Asahel and Jahaziah the son of Tikvah
        were employed about this matter: and Meshullam and Shabbethai
        the Levite helped them.

010:016 And the children of the captivity did so. And Ezra the priest,
        with certain chief of the fathers, after the house of their
        fathers, and all of them by their names, were separated, and
        sat down in the first day of the tenth month to examine the
        matter.

010:017 And they made an end with all the men that had taken strange
        wives by the first day of the first month.

010:018 And among the sons of the priests there were found that had
        taken strange wives: namely, of the sons of Jeshua the son of
        Jozadak, and his brethren; Maaseiah, and Eliezer, and Jarib,
        and Gedaliah.

010:019 And they gave their hands that they would put away their
        wives; and being guilty, they offered a ram of the flock for
        their trespass.

010:020 And of the sons of Immer; Hanani, and Zebadiah.

010:021 And of the sons of Harim; Maaseiah, and Elijah, and Shemaiah,
        and Jehiel, and Uzziah.

010:022 And of the sons of Pashur; Elioenai, Maaseiah, Ishmael,
        Nethaneel, Jozabad, and Elasah.

010:023 Also of the Levites; Jozabad, and Shimei, and Kelaiah, (the
        same is Kelita,) Pethahiah, Judah, and Eliezer.

010:024 Of the singers also; Eliashib: and of the porters; Shallum,
        and Telem, and Uri.

010:025 Moreover of Israel: of the sons of Parosh; Ramiah, and Jeziah,
        and Malchiah, and Miamin, and Eleazar, and Malchijah, and
        Benaiah.

010:026 And of the sons of Elam; Mattaniah, Zechariah, and Jehiel, and
        Abdi, and Jeremoth, and Eliah.

010:027 And of the sons of Zattu; Elioenai, Eliashib, Mattaniah, and
        Jeremoth, and Zabad, and Aziza.

010:028 Of the sons also of Bebai; Jehohanan, Hananiah, Zabbai, and
        Athlai.

010:029 And of the sons of Bani; Meshullam, Malluch, and Adaiah,
        Jashub, and Sheal, and Ramoth.

010:030 And of the sons of Pahathmoab; Adna, and Chelal, Benaiah,
        Maaseiah, Mattaniah, Bezaleel, and Binnui, and Manasseh.

010:031 And of the sons of Harim; Eliezer, Ishijah, Malchiah,
        Shemaiah, Shimeon,

010:032 Benjamin, Malluch, and Shemariah.

010:033 Of the sons of Hashum; Mattenai, Mattathah, Zabad, Eliphelet,
        Jeremai, Manasseh, and Shimei.

010:034 Of the sons of Bani; Maadai, Amram, and Uel,

010:035 Benaiah, Bedeiah, Chelluh,

010:036 Vaniah, Meremoth, Eliashib,

010:037 Mattaniah, Mattenai, and Jaasau,

010:038 And Bani, and Binnui, Shimei,

010:039 And Shelemiah, and Nathan, and Adaiah,

010:040 Machnadebai, Shashai, Sharai,

010:041 Azareel, and Shelemiah, Shemariah,

010:042 Shallum, Amariah, and Joseph.

010:043 Of the sons of Nebo; Jeiel, Mattithiah, Zabad, Zebina, Jadau,
        and Joel, Benaiah.

010:044 All these had taken strange wives: and some of them had wives
        by whom they had children.

Book 16	Nehemiah

001:001 The words of Nehemiah the son of Hachaliah. And it came to
        pass in the month Chisleu, in the twentieth year, as I was in
        Shushan the palace,

001:002 That Hanani, one of my brethren, came, he and certain men of
        Judah; and I asked them concerning the Jews that had escaped,
        which were left of the captivity, and concerning Jerusalem.

001:003 And they said unto me, The remnant that are left of the
        captivity there in the province are in great affliction and
        reproach: the wall of Jerusalem also is broken down, and the
        gates thereof are burned with fire.

001:004 And it came to pass, when I heard these words, that I sat down
        and wept, and mourned certain days, and fasted, and prayed
        before the God of heaven,

001:005 And said, I beseech thee, O LORD God of heaven, the great and
        terrible God, that keepeth covenant and mercy for them that
        love him and observe his commandments:

001:006 Let thine ear now be attentive, and thine eyes open, that thou
        mayest hear the prayer of thy servant, which I pray before
        thee now, day and night, for the children of Israel thy
        servants, and confess the sins of the children of Israel,
        which we have sinned against thee: both I and my father's
        house have sinned.

001:007 We have dealt very corruptly against thee, and have not kept
        the commandments, nor the statutes, nor the judgments, which
        thou commandedst thy servant Moses.

001:008 Remember, I beseech thee, the word that thou commandedst thy
        servant Moses, saying, If ye transgress, I will scatter you
        abroad among the nations:

001:009 But if ye turn unto me, and keep my commandments, and do them;
        though there were of you cast out unto the uttermost part of
        the heaven, yet will I gather them from thence, and will bring
        them unto the place that I have chosen to set my name there.

001:010 Now these are thy servants and thy people, whom thou hast
        redeemed by thy great power, and by thy strong hand.

001:011 O LORD, I beseech thee, let now thine ear be attentive to the
        prayer of thy servant, and to the prayer of thy servants, who
        desire to fear thy name: and prosper, I pray thee, thy servant
        this day, and grant him mercy in the sight of this man. For I
        was the king's cupbearer.

002:001 And it came to pass in the month Nisan, in the twentieth year
        of Artaxerxes the king, that wine was before him: and I took
        up the wine, and gave it unto the king. Now I had not been
        beforetime sad in his presence.

002:002 Wherefore the king said unto me, Why is thy countenance sad,
        seeing thou art not sick? this is nothing else but sorrow of
        heart. Then I was very sore afraid,

002:003 And said unto the king, Let the king live for ever: why should
        not my countenance be sad, when the city, the place of my
        fathers' sepulchres, lieth waste, and the gates thereof are
        consumed with fire?

002:004 Then the king said unto me, For what dost thou make request?
        So I prayed to the God of heaven.

002:005 And I said unto the king, If it please the king, and if thy
        servant have found favour in thy sight, that thou wouldest
        send me unto Judah, unto the city of my fathers' sepulchres,
        that I may build it.

002:006 And the king said unto me, (the queen also sitting by him,)
        For how long shall thy journey be? and when wilt thou return?
        So it pleased the king to send me; and I set him a time.

002:007 Moreover I said unto the king, If it please the king, let
        letters be given me to the governors beyond the river, that
        they may convey me over till I come into Judah;

002:008 And a letter unto Asaph the keeper of the king's forest, that
        he may give me timber to make beams for the gates of the
        palace which appertained to the house, and for the wall of the
        city, and for the house that I shall enter into. And the king
        granted me, according to the good hand of my God upon me.

002:009 Then I came to the governors beyond the river, and gave them
        the king's letters. Now the king had sent captains of the army
        and horsemen with me.

002:010 When Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the servant, the
        Ammonite, heard of it, it grieved them exceedingly that there
        was come a man to seek the welfare of the children of Israel.

002:011 So I came to Jerusalem, and was there three days.

002:012 And I arose in the night, I and some few men with me; neither
        told I any man what my God had put in my heart to do at
        Jerusalem: neither was there any beast with me, save the beast
        that I rode upon.

002:013 And I went out by night by the gate of the valley, even before
        the dragon well, and to the dung port, and viewed the walls of
        Jerusalem, which were broken down, and the gates thereof were
        consumed with fire.

002:014 Then I went on to the gate of the fountain, and to the king's
        pool: but there was no place for the beast that was under me
        to pass.

002:015 Then went I up in the night by the brook, and viewed the wall,
        and turned back, and entered by the gate of the valley, and so
        returned.

002:016 And the rulers knew not whither I went, or what I did; neither
        had I as yet told it to the Jews, nor to the priests, nor to
        the nobles, nor to the rulers, nor to the rest that did the
        work.

002:017 Then said I unto them, Ye see the distress that we are in, how
        Jerusalem lieth waste, and the gates thereof are burned with
        fire: come, and let us build up the wall of Jerusalem, that we
        be no more a reproach.

002:018 Then I told them of the hand of my God which was good upon me;
        as also the king's words that he had spoken unto me. And they
        said, Let us rise up and build. So they strengthened their
        hands for this good work.

002:019 But when Sanballat the Horonite, and Tobiah the servant, the
        Ammonite, and Geshem the Arabian, heard it, they laughed us to
        scorn, and despised us, and said, What is this thing that ye
        do? will ye rebel against the king?

002:020 Then answered I them, and said unto them, The God of heaven,
        he will prosper us; therefore we his servants will arise and
        build: but ye have no portion, nor right, nor memorial, in
        Jerusalem.

003:001 Then Eliashib the high priest rose up with his brethren the
        priests, and they builded the sheep gate; they sanctified it,
        and set up the doors of it; even unto the tower of Meah they
        sanctified it, unto the tower of Hananeel.

003:002 And next unto him builded the men of Jericho. And next to them
        builded Zaccur the son of Imri.

003:003 But the fish gate did the sons of Hassenaah build, who also
        laid the beams thereof, and set up the doors thereof, the
        locks thereof, and the bars thereof.

003:004 And next unto them repaired Meremoth the son of Urijah, the
        son of Koz. And next unto them repaired Meshullam the son of
        Berechiah, the son of Meshezabeel. And next unto them repaired
        Zadok the son of Baana.

003:005 And next unto them the Tekoites repaired; but their nobles put
        not their necks to the work of their LORD.

003:006 Moreover the old gate repaired Jehoiada the son of Paseah, and
        Meshullam the son of Besodeiah; they laid the beams thereof,
        and set up the doors thereof, and the locks thereof, and the
        bars thereof.

003:007 And next unto them repaired Melatiah the Gibeonite, and Jadon
        the Meronothite, the men of Gibeon, and of Mizpah, unto the
        throne of the governor on this side the river.

003:008 Next unto him repaired Uzziel the son of Harhaiah, of the
        goldsmiths. Next unto him also repaired Hananiah the son of
        one of the apothecaries, and they fortified Jerusalem unto the
        broad wall.

003:009 And next unto them repaired Rephaiah the son of Hur, the ruler
        of the half part of Jerusalem.

003:010 And next unto them repaired Jedaiah the son of Harumaph, even
        over against his house. And next unto him repaired Hattush the
        son of Hashabniah.

003:011 Malchijah the son of Harim, and Hashub the son of Pahathmoab,
        repaired the other piece, and the tower of the furnaces.

003:012 And next unto him repaired Shallum the son of Halohesh, the
        ruler of the half part of Jerusalem, he and his daughters.

003:013 The valley gate repaired Hanun, and the inhabitants of Zanoah;
        they built it, and set up the doors thereof, the locks
        thereof, and the bars thereof, and a thousand cubits on the
        wall unto the dung gate.

003:014 But the dung gate repaired Malchiah the son of Rechab, the
        ruler of part of Bethhaccerem; he built it, and set up the
        doors thereof, the locks thereof, and the bars thereof.

003:015 But the gate of the fountain repaired Shallun the son of
        Colhozeh, the ruler of part of Mizpah; he built it, and
        covered it, and set up the doors thereof, the locks thereof,
        and the bars thereof, and the wall of the pool of Siloah by
        the king's garden, and unto the stairs that go down from the
        city of David.

003:016 After him repaired Nehemiah the son of Azbuk, the ruler of the
        half part of Bethzur, unto the place over against the
        sepulchres of David, and to the pool that was made, and unto
        the house of the mighty.

003:017 After him repaired the Levites, Rehum the son of Bani. Next
        unto him repaired Hashabiah, the ruler of the half part of
        Keilah, in his part.

003:018 After him repaired their brethren, Bavai the son of Henadad,
        the ruler of the half part of Keilah.

003:019 And next to him repaired Ezer the son of Jeshua, the ruler of
        Mizpah, another piece over against the going up to the armoury
        at the turning of the wall.

003:020 After him Baruch the son of Zabbai earnestly repaired the
        other piece, from the turning of the wall unto the door of the
        house of Eliashib the high priest.

003:021 After him repaired Meremoth the son of Urijah the son of Koz
        another piece, from the door of the house of Eliashib even to
        the end of the house of Eliashib.

003:022 And after him repaired the priests, the men of the plain.

003:023 After him repaired Benjamin and Hashub over against their
        house. After him repaired Azariah the son of Maaseiah the son
        of Ananiah by his house.

003:024 After him repaired Binnui the son of Henadad another piece,
        from the house of Azariah unto the turning of the wall, even
        unto the corner.

003:025 Palal the son of Uzai, over against the turning of the wall,
        and the tower which lieth out from the king's high house, that
        was by the court of the prison. After him Pedaiah the son of
        Parosh.

003:026 Moreover the Nethinims dwelt in Ophel, unto the place over
        against the water gate toward the east, and the tower that
        lieth out.

003:027 After them the Tekoites repaired another piece, over against
        the great tower that lieth out, even unto the wall of Ophel.

003:028 From above the horse gate repaired the priests, every one over
        against his house.

003:029 After them repaired Zadok the son of Immer over against his
        house. After him repaired also Shemaiah the son of Shechaniah,
        the keeper of the east gate.

003:030 After him repaired Hananiah the son of Shelemiah, and Hanun
        the sixth son of Zalaph, another piece. After him repaired
        Meshullam the son of Berechiah over against his chamber.

003:031 After him repaired Malchiah the goldsmith's son unto the place
        of the Nethinims, and of the merchants, over against the gate
        Miphkad, and to the going up of the corner.

003:032 And between the going up of the corner unto the sheep gate
        repaired the goldsmiths and the merchants.

004:001 But it came to pass, that when Sanballat heard that we builded
        the wall, he was wroth, and took great indignation, and mocked
        the Jews.

004:002 And he spake before his brethren and the army of Samaria, and
        said, What do these feeble Jews? will they fortify themselves?
        will they sacrifice? will they make an end in a day? will they
        revive the stones out of the heaps of the rubbish which are
        burned?

004:003 Now Tobiah the Ammonite was by him, and he said, Even that
        which they build, if a fox go up, he shall even break down
        their stone wall.

004:004 Hear, O our God; for we are despised: and turn their reproach
        upon their own head, and give them for a prey in the land of
        captivity:

004:005 And cover not their iniquity, and let not their sin be blotted
        out from before thee: for they have provoked thee to anger
        before the builders.

004:006 So built we the wall; and all the wall was joined together
        unto the half thereof: for the people had a mind to work.

004:007 But it came to pass, that when Sanballat, and Tobiah, and the
        Arabians, and the Ammonites, and the Ashdodites, heard that
        the walls of Jerusalem were made up, and that the breaches
        began to be stopped, then they were very wroth,

004:008 And conspired all of them together to come and to fight
        against Jerusalem, and to hinder it.

004:009 Nevertheless we made our prayer unto our God, and set a watch
        against them day and night, because of them.

004:010 And Judah said, The strength of the bearers of burdens is
        decayed, and there is much rubbish; so that we are not able to
        build the wall.

004:011 And our adversaries said, They shall not know, neither see,
        till we come in the midst among them, and slay them, and cause
        the work to cease.

004:012 And it came to pass, that when the Jews which dwelt by them
        came, they said unto us ten times, From all places whence ye
        shall return unto us they will be upon you.

004:013 Therefore set I in the lower places behind the wall, and on
        the higher places, I even set the people after their families
        with their swords, their spears, and their bows.

004:014 And I looked, and rose up, and said unto the nobles, and to
        the rulers, and to the rest of the people, Be not ye afraid of
        them: remember the LORD, which is great and terrible, and
        fight for your brethren, your sons, and your daughters, your
        wives, and your houses.

004:015 And it came to pass, when our enemies heard that it was known
        unto us, and God had brought their counsel to nought, that we
        returned all of us to the wall, every one unto his work.

004:016 And it came to pass from that time forth, that the half of my
        servants wrought in the work, and the other half of them held
        both the spears, the shields, and the bows, and the
        habergeons; and the rulers were behind all the house of Judah.

004:017 They which builded on the wall, and they that bare burdens,
        with those that laded, every one with one of his hands wrought
        in the work, and with the other hand held a weapon.

004:018 For the builders, every one had his sword girded by his side,
        and so builded. And he that sounded the trumpet was by me.

004:019 And I said unto the nobles, and to the rulers, and to the rest
        of the people, The work is great and large, and we are
        separated upon the wall, one far from another.

004:020 In what place therefore ye hear the sound of the trumpet,
        resort ye thither unto us: our God shall fight for us.

004:021 So we laboured in the work: and half of them held the spears
        from the rising of the morning till the stars appeared.

004:022 Likewise at the same time said I unto the people, Let every
        one with his servant lodge within Jerusalem, that in the night
        they may be a guard to us, and labour on the day.

004:023 So neither I, nor my brethren, nor my servants, nor the men of
        the guard which followed me, none of us put off our clothes,
        saving that every one put them off for washing.

005:001 And there was a great cry of the people and of their wives
        against their brethren the Jews.

005:002 For there were that said, We, our sons, and our daughters, are
        many: therefore we take up corn for them, that we may eat, and
        live.

005:003 Some also there were that said, We have mortgaged our lands,
        vineyards, and houses, that we might buy corn, because of the
        dearth.

005:004 There were also that said, We have borrowed money for the
        king's tribute, and that upon our lands and vineyards.

005:005 Yet now our flesh is as the flesh of our brethren, our
        children as their children: and, lo, we bring into bondage our
        sons and our daughters to be servants, and some of our
        daughters are brought unto bondage already: neither is it in
        our power to redeem them; for other men have our lands and
        vineyards.

005:006 And I was very angry when I heard their cry and these words.

005:007 Then I consulted with myself, and I rebuked the nobles, and
        the rulers, and said unto them, Ye exact usury, every one of
        his brother. And I set a great assembly against them.

005:008 And I said unto them, We after our ability have redeemed our
        brethren the Jews, which were sold unto the heathen; and will
        ye even sell your brethren? or shall they be sold unto us?
        Then held they their peace, and found nothing to answer.

005:009 Also I said, It is not good that ye do: ought ye not to walk
        in the fear of our God because of the reproach of the heathen
        our enemies?

005:010 I likewise, and my brethren, and my servants, might exact of
        them money and corn: I pray you, let us leave off this usury.

005:011 Restore, I pray you, to them, even this day, their lands,
        their vineyards, their oliveyards, and their houses, also the
        hundredth part of the money, and of the corn, the wine, and
        the oil, that ye exact of them.

005:012 Then said they, We will restore them, and will require nothing
        of them; so will we do as thou sayest. Then I called the
        priests, and took an oath of them, that they should do
        according to this promise.

005:013 Also I shook my lap, and said, So God shake out every man from
        his house, and from his labour, that performeth not this
        promise, even thus be he shaken out, and emptied. And all the
        congregation said, Amen, and praised the LORD. And the people
        did according to this promise.

005:014 Moreover from the time that I was appointed to be their
        governor in the land of Judah, from the twentieth year even
        unto the two and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes the king, that
        is, twelve years, I and my brethren have not eaten the bread
        of the governor.

005:015 But the former governors that had been before me were
        chargeable unto the people, and had taken of them bread and
        wine, beside forty shekels of silver; yea, even their servants
        bare rule over the people: but so did not I, because of the
        fear of God.

005:016 Yea, also I continued in the work of this wall, neither bought
        we any land: and all my servants were gathered thither unto
        the work.

005:017 Moreover there were at my table an hundred and fifty of the
        Jews and rulers, beside those that came unto us from among the
        heathen that are about us.

005:018 Now that which was prepared for me daily was one ox and six
        choice sheep; also fowls were prepared for me, and once in ten
        days store of all sorts of wine: yet for all this required not
        I the bread of the governor, because the bondage was heavy
        upon this people.

005:019 Think upon me, my God, for good, according to all that I have
        done for this people.

006:001 Now it came to pass when Sanballat, and Tobiah, and Geshem the
        Arabian, and the rest of our enemies, heard that I had builded
        the wall, and that there was no breach left therein; (though
        at that time I had not set up the doors upon the gates;)

006:002 That Sanballat and Geshem sent unto me, saying, Come, let us
        meet together in some one of the villages in the plain of Ono.
        But they thought to do me mischief.

006:003 And I sent messengers unto them, saying, I am doing a great
        work, so that I cannot come down: why should the work cease,
        whilst I leave it, and come down to you?

006:004 Yet they sent unto me four times after this sort; and I
        answered them after the same manner.

006:005 Then sent Sanballat his servant unto me in like manner the
        fifth time with an open letter in his hand;

006:006 Wherein was written, It is reported among the heathen, and
        Gashmu saith it, that thou and the Jews think to rebel: for
        which cause thou buildest the wall, that thou mayest be their
        king, according to these words.

006:007 And thou hast also appointed prophets to preach of thee at
        Jerusalem, saying, There is a king in Judah: and now shall it
        be reported to the king according to these words. Come now
        therefore, and let us take counsel together.

006:008 Then I sent unto him, saying, There are no such things done as
        thou sayest, but thou feignest them out of thine own heart.

006:009 For they all made us afraid, saying, Their hands shall be
        weakened from the work, that it be not done. Now therefore, O
        God, strengthen my hands.

006:010 Afterward I came unto the house of Shemaiah the son of Delaiah
        the son of Mehetabeel, who was shut up; and he said, Let us
        meet together in the house of God, within the temple, and let
        us shut the doors of the temple: for they will come to slay
        thee; yea, in the night will they come to slay thee.

006:011 And I said, Should such a man as I flee? and who is there,
        that, being as I am, would go into the temple to save his
        life? I will not go in.

006:012 And, lo, I perceived that God had not sent him; but that he
        pronounced this prophecy against me: for Tobiah and Sanballat
        had hired him.

006:013 Therefore was he hired, that I should be afraid, and do so,
        and sin, and that they might have matter for an evil report,
        that they might reproach me.

006:014 My God, think thou upon Tobiah and Sanballat according to
        these their works, and on the prophetess Noadiah, and the rest
        of the prophets, that would have put me in fear.

006:015 So the wall was finished in the twenty and fifth day of the
        month Elul, in fifty and two days.

006:016 And it came to pass, that when all our enemies heard thereof,
        and all the heathen that were about us saw these things, they
        were much cast down in their own eyes: for they perceived that
        this work was wrought of our God.

006:017 Moreover in those days the nobles of Judah sent many letters
        unto Tobiah, and the letters of Tobiah came unto them.

006:018 For there were many in Judah sworn unto him, because he was
        the son in law of Shechaniah the son of Arah; and his son
        Johanan had taken the daughter of Meshullam the son of
        Berechiah.

006:019 Also they reported his good deeds before me, and uttered my
        words to him. And Tobiah sent letters to put me in fear.

007:001 Now it came to pass, when the wall was built, and I had set up
        the doors, and the porters and the singers and the Levites
        were appointed,

007:002 That I gave my brother Hanani, and Hananiah the ruler of the
        palace, charge over Jerusalem: for he was a faithful man, and
        feared God above many.

007:003 And I said unto them, Let not the gates of Jerusalem be opened
        until the sun be hot; and while they stand by, let them shut
        the doors, and bar them: and appoint watches of the
        inhabitants of Jerusalem, every one in his watch, and every
        one to be over against his house.

007:004 Now the city was large and great: but the people were few
        therein, and the houses were not builded.

007:005 And my God put into mine heart to gather together the nobles,
        and the rulers, and the people, that they might be reckoned by
        genealogy. And I found a register of the genealogy of them
        which came up at the first, and found written therein,

007:006 These are the children of the province, that went up out of
        the captivity, of those that had been carried away, whom
        Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away, and came
        again to Jerusalem and to Judah, every one unto his city;

007:007 Who came with Zerubbabel, Jeshua, Nehemiah, Azariah, Raamiah,
        Nahamani, Mordecai, Bilshan, Mispereth, Bigvai, Nehum, Baanah.
        The number, I say, of the men of the people of Israel was
        this;

007:008 The children of Parosh, two thousand an hundred seventy and
        two.

007:009 The children of Shephatiah, three hundred seventy and two.

007:010 The children of Arah, six hundred fifty and two.

007:011 The children of Pahathmoab, of the children of Jeshua and
        Joab, two thousand and eight hundred and eighteen.

007:012 The children of Elam, a thousand two hundred fifty and four.

007:013 The children of Zattu, eight hundred forty and five.

007:014 The children of Zaccai, seven hundred and threescore.

007:015 The children of Binnui, six hundred forty and eight.

007:016 The children of Bebai, six hundred twenty and eight.

007:017 The children of Azgad, two thousand three hundred twenty and
        two.

007:018 The children of Adonikam, six hundred threescore and seven.

007:019 The children of Bigvai, two thousand threescore and seven.

007:020 The children of Adin, six hundred fifty and five.

007:060 All the Nethinims, and the children of Solomon's servants,
        were three hundred ninety and two.

007:061 And these were they which went up also from Telmelah,
        Telharesha, Cherub, Addon, and Immer: but they could not shew
        their father's house, nor their seed, whether they were of
        Israel.

007:062 The children of Delaiah, the children of Tobiah, the children
        of Nekoda, six hundred forty and two.

007:063 And of the priests: the children of Habaiah, the children of
        Koz, the children of Barzillai, which took one of the
        daughters of Barzillai the Gileadite to wife, and was called
        after their name.

007:064 These sought their register among those that were reckoned by
        genealogy, but it was not found: therefore were they, as
        polluted, put from the priesthood.

007:065 And the Tirshatha said unto them, that they should not eat of
        the most holy things, till there stood up a priest with Urim
        and Thummim.

007:066 The whole congregation together was forty and two thousand
        three hundred and threescore,

007:067 Beside their manservants and their maidservants, of whom there
        were seven thousand three hundred thirty and seven: and they
        had two hundred forty and five singing men and singing women.

007:068 Their horses, seven hundred thirty and six: their mules, two
        hundred forty and five:

007:069 Their camels, four hundred thirty and five: six thousand seven
        hundred and twenty asses.

007:070 And some of the chief of the fathers gave unto the work. The
        Tirshatha gave to the treasure a thousand drams of gold, fifty
        basons, five hundred and thirty priests' garments.

007:071 And some of the chief of the fathers gave to the treasure of
        the work twenty thousand drams of gold, and two thousand and
        two hundred pound of silver.

007:072 And that which the rest of the people gave was twenty thousand
        drams of gold, and two thousand pound of silver, and
        threescore and seven priests' garments.

007:073 So the priests, and the Levites, and the porters, and the
        singers, and some of the people, and the Nethinims, and all
        Israel, dwelt in their cities; and when the seventh month
        came, the children of Israel were in their cities.

008:001 And all the people gathered themselves together as one man
        into the street that was before the water gate; and they spake
        unto Ezra the scribe to bring the book of the law of Moses,
        which the LORD had commanded to Israel.

008:002 And Ezra the priest brought the law before the congregation
        both of men and women, and all that could hear with
        understanding, upon the first day of the seventh month.

008:003 And he read therein before the street that was before the
        water gate from the morning until midday, before the men and
        the women, and those that could understand; and the ears of
        all the people were attentive unto the book of the law.

008:004 And Ezra the scribe stood upon a pulpit of wood, which they
        had made for the purpose; and beside him stood Mattithiah, and
        Shema, and Anaiah, and Urijah, and Hilkiah, and Maaseiah, on
        his right hand; and on his left hand, Pedaiah, and Mishael,
        and Malchiah, and Hashum, and Hashbadana, Zechariah, and
        Meshullam.

008:005 And Ezra opened the book in the sight of all the people; (for
        he was above all the people;) and when he opened it, all the
        people stood up:

008:006 And Ezra blessed the LORD, the great God. And all the people
        answered, Amen, Amen, with lifting up their hands: and they
        bowed their heads, and worshipped the LORD with their faces to
        the ground.

008:007 Also Jeshua, and Bani, and Sherebiah, Jamin, Akkub,
        Shabbethai, Hodijah, Maaseiah, Kelita, Azariah, Jozabad,
        Hanan, Pelaiah, and the Levites, caused the people to
        understand the law: and the people stood in their place.

008:008 So they read in the book in the law of God distinctly, and
        gave the sense, and caused them to understand the reading.

008:009 And Nehemiah, which is the Tirshatha, and Ezra the priest the
        scribe, and the Levites that taught the people, said unto all
        the people, This day is holy unto the LORD your God; mourn
        not, nor weep. For all the people wept, when they heard the
        words of the law.

008:010 Then he said unto them, Go your way, eat the fat, and drink
        the sweet, and send portions unto them for whom nothing is
        prepared: for this day is holy unto our LORD: neither be ye
        sorry; for the joy of the LORD is your strength.

008:011 So the Levites stilled all the people, saying, Hold your
        peace, for the day is holy; neither be ye grieved.

008:012 And all the people went their way to eat, and to drink, and to
        send portions, and to make great mirth, because they had
        understood the words that were declared unto them.

008:013 And on the second day were gathered together the chief of the
        fathers of all the people, the priests, and the Levites, unto
        Ezra the scribe, even to understand the words of the law.

008:014 And they found written in the law which the LORD had commanded
        by Moses, that the children of Israel should dwell in booths
        in the feast of the seventh month:

008:015 And that they should publish and proclaim in all their cities,
        and in Jerusalem, saying, Go forth unto the mount, and fetch
        olive branches, and pine branches, and myrtle branches, and
        palm branches, and branches of thick trees, to make booths, as
        it is written.

008:016 So the people went forth, and brought them, and made
        themselves booths, every one upon the roof of his house, and
        in their courts, and in the courts of the house of God, and in
        the street of the water gate, and in the street of the gate of
        Ephraim.

008:017 And all the congregation of them that were come again out of
        the captivity made booths, and sat under the booths: for since
        the days of Jeshua the son of Nun unto that day had not the
        children of Israel done so. And there was very great gladness.

008:018 Also day by day, from the first day unto the last day, he read
        in the book of the law of God. And they kept the feast seven
        days; and on the eighth day was a solemn assembly, according
        unto the manner.

009:001 Now in the twenty and fourth day of this month the children of
        Israel were assembled with fasting, and with sackclothes, and
        earth upon them.

009:002 And the seed of Israel separated themselves from all
        strangers, and stood and confessed their sins, and the
        iniquities of their fathers.

009:003 And they stood up in their place, and read in the book of the
        law of the LORD their God one fourth part of the day; and
        another fourth part they confessed, and worshipped the LORD
        their God.

009:004 Then stood up upon the stairs, of the Levites, Jeshua, and
        Bani, Kadmiel, Shebaniah, Bunni, Sherebiah, Bani, and Chenani,
        and cried with a loud voice unto the LORD their God.

009:005 Then the Levites, Jeshua, and Kadmiel, Bani, Hashabniah,
        Sherebiah, Hodijah, Shebaniah, and Pethahiah, said, Stand up
        and bless the LORD your God for ever and ever: and blessed be
        thy glorious name, which is exalted above all blessing and
        praise.

009:006 Thou, even thou, art LORD alone; thou hast made heaven, the
        heaven of heavens, with all their host, the earth, and all
        things that are therein, the seas, and all that is therein,
        and thou preservest them all; and the host of heaven
        worshippeth thee.

009:007 Thou art the LORD the God, who didst choose Abram, and
        broughtest him forth out of Ur of the Chaldees, and gavest him
        the name of Abraham;

009:008 And foundest his heart faithful before thee, and madest a
        covenant with him to give the land of the Canaanites, the
        Hittites, the Amorites, and the Perizzites, and the Jebusites,
        and the Girgashites, to give it, I say, to his seed, and hast
        performed thy words; for thou art righteous:

009:009 And didst see the affliction of our fathers in Egypt, and
        heardest their cry by the Red sea;

009:010 And shewedst signs and wonders upon Pharaoh, and on all his
        servants, and on all the people of his land: for thou knewest
        that they dealt proudly against them. So didst thou get thee a
        name, as it is this day.

009:011 And thou didst divide the sea before them, so that they went
        through the midst of the sea on the dry land; and their
        persecutors thou threwest into the deeps, as a stone into the
        mighty waters.

009:012 Moreover thou leddest them in the day by a cloudy pillar; and
        in the night by a pillar of fire, to give them light in the
        way wherein they should go.

009:013 Thou camest down also upon mount Sinai, and spakest with them
        from heaven, and gavest them right judgments, and true laws,
        good statutes and commandments:

009:014 And madest known unto them thy holy sabbath, and commandedst
        them precepts, statutes, and laws, by the hand of Moses thy
        servant:

009:015 And gavest them bread from heaven for their hunger, and
        broughtest forth water for them out of the rock for their
        thirst, and promisedst them that they should go in to possess
        the land which thou hadst sworn to give them.

009:016 But they and our fathers dealt proudly, and hardened their
        necks, and hearkened not to thy commandments,

009:017 And refused to obey, neither were mindful of thy wonders that
        thou didst among them; but hardened their necks, and in their
        rebellion appointed a captain to return to their bondage: but
        thou art a God ready to pardon, gracious and merciful, slow to
        anger, and of great kindness, and forsookest them not.

009:018 Yea, when they had made them a molten calf, and said, This is
        thy God that brought thee up out of Egypt, and had wrought
        great provocations;

009:019 Yet thou in thy manifold mercies forsookest them not in the
        wilderness: the pillar of the cloud departed not from them by
        day, to lead them in the way; neither the pillar of fire by
        night, to shew them light, and the way wherein they should go.

009:020 Thou gavest also thy good spirit to instruct them, and
        withheldest not thy manna from their mouth, and gavest them
        water for their thirst.

009:021 Yea, forty years didst thou sustain them in the wilderness, so
        that they lacked nothing; their clothes waxed not old, and
        their feet swelled not.

009:022 Moreover thou gavest them kingdoms and nations, and didst
        divide them into corners: so they possessed the land of Sihon,
        and the land of the king of Heshbon, and the land of Og king
        of Bashan.

009:023 Their children also multipliedst thou as the stars of heaven,
        and broughtest them into the land, concerning which thou hadst
        promised to their fathers, that they should go in to possess
        it.

009:024 So the children went in and possessed the land, and thou
        subduedst before them the inhabitants of the land, the
        Canaanites, and gavest them into their hands, with their
        kings, and the people of the land, that they might do with
        them as they would.

009:025 And they took strong cities, and a fat land, and possessed
        houses full of all goods, wells digged, vineyards, and
        oliveyards, and fruit trees in abundance: so they did eat, and
        were filled, and became fat, and delighted themselves in thy
        great goodness.

009:026 Nevertheless they were disobedient, and rebelled against thee,
        and cast thy law behind their backs, and slew thy prophets
        which testified against them to turn them to thee, and they
        wrought great provocations.

009:027 Therefore thou deliveredst them into the hand of their
        enemies, who vexed them: and in the time of their trouble,
        when they cried unto thee, thou heardest them from heaven; and
        according to thy manifold mercies thou gavest them saviours,
        who saved them out of the hand of their enemies.

009:028 But after they had rest, they did evil again before thee:
        therefore leftest thou them in the land of their enemies, so
        that they had the dominion over them: yet when they returned,
        and cried unto thee, thou heardest them from heaven; and many
        times didst thou deliver them according to thy mercies;

009:029 And testifiedst against them, that thou mightest bring them
        again unto thy law: yet they dealt proudly, and hearkened not
        unto thy commandments, but sinned against thy judgments,
        (which if a man do, he shall live in them;) and withdrew the
        shoulder, and hardened their neck, and would not hear.

009:030 Yet many years didst thou forbear them, and testifiedst
        against them by thy spirit in thy prophets: yet would they not
        give ear: therefore gavest thou them into the hand of the
        people of the lands.

009:031 Nevertheless for thy great mercies' sake thou didst not
        utterly consume them, nor forsake them; for thou art a
        gracious and merciful God.

009:032 Now therefore, our God, the great, the mighty, and the
        terrible God, who keepest covenant and mercy, let not all the
        trouble seem little before thee, that hath come upon us, on
        our kings, on our princes, and on our priests, and on our
        prophets, and on our fathers, and on all thy people, since the
        time of the kings of Assyria unto this day.

009:033 Howbeit thou art just in all that is brought upon us; for thou
        hast done right, but we have done wickedly:

009:034 Neither have our kings, our princes, our priests, nor our
        fathers, kept thy law, nor hearkened unto thy commandments and
        thy testimonies, wherewith thou didst testify against them.

009:035 For they have not served thee in their kingdom, and in thy
        great goodness that thou gavest them, and in the large and fat
        land which thou gavest before them, neither turned they from
        their wicked works.

009:036 Behold, we are servants this day, and for the land that thou
        gavest unto our fathers to eat the fruit thereof and the good
        thereof, behold, we are servants in it:

009:037 And it yieldeth much increase unto the kings whom thou hast
        set over us because of our sins: also they have dominion over
        our bodies, and over our cattle, at their pleasure, and we are
        in great distress.

009:038 And because of all this we make a sure covenant, and write it;
        and our princes, Levites, and priests, seal unto it.

010:001 Now those that sealed were, Nehemiah, the Tirshatha, the son
        of Hachaliah, and Zidkijah,

010:002 Seraiah, Azariah, Jeremiah,

010:003 Pashur, Amariah, Malchijah,

010:004 Hattush, Shebaniah, Malluch,

010:005 Harim, Meremoth, Obadiah,

010:006 Daniel, Ginnethon, Baruch,

010:007 Meshullam, Abijah, Mijamin,

010:008 Maaziah, Bilgai, Shemaiah: these were the priests.

010:009 And the Levites: both Jeshua the son of Azaniah, Binnui of the
        sons of Henadad, Kadmiel;

010:010 And their brethren, Shebaniah, Hodijah, Kelita, Pelaiah,
        Hanan,

010:011 Micha, Rehob, Hashabiah,

010:012 Zaccur, Sherebiah, Shebaniah,

010:013 Hodijah, Bani, Beninu.

010:014 The chief of the people; Parosh, Pahathmoab, Elam, Zatthu,
        Bani,

010:015 Bunni, Azgad, Bebai,

010:016 Adonijah, Bigvai, Adin,

010:017 Ater, Hizkijah, Azzur,

010:018 Hodijah, Hashum, Bezai,

010:019 Hariph, Anathoth, Nebai,

010:020 Magpiash, Meshullam, Hezir,

010:021 Meshezabeel, Zadok, Jaddua,

010:022 Pelatiah, Hanan, Anaiah,

010:023 Hoshea, Hananiah, Hashub,

010:024 Hallohesh, Pileha, Shobek,

010:025 Rehum, Hashabnah, Maaseiah,

010:026 And Ahijah, Hanan, Anan,

010:027 Malluch, Harim, Baanah.

010:028 And the rest of the people, the priests, the Levites, the
        porters, the singers, the Nethinims, and all they that had
        separated themselves from the people of the lands unto the law
        of God, their wives, their sons, and their daughters, every
        one having knowledge, and having understanding;

010:029 They clave to their brethren, their nobles, and entered into a
        curse, and into an oath, to walk in God's law, which was given
        by Moses the servant of God, and to observe and do all the
        commandments of the LORD our Lord, and his judgments and his
        statutes;

010:030 And that we would not give our daughters unto the people of
        the land, not take their daughters for our sons:

010:031 And if the people of the land bring ware or any victuals on
        the sabbath day to sell, that we would not buy it of them on
        the sabbath, or on the holy day: and that we would leave the
        seventh year, and the exaction of every debt.

010:032 Also we made ordinances for us, to charge ourselves yearly
        with the third part of a shekel for the service of the house
        of our God;

010:033 For the shewbread, and for the continual meat offering, and
        for the continual burnt offering, of the sabbaths, of the new
        moons, for the set feasts, and for the holy things, and for
        the sin offerings to make an atonement for Israel, and for all
        the work of the house of our God.

010:034 And we cast the lots among the priests, the Levites, and the
        people, for the wood offering, to bring it into the house of
        our God, after the houses of our fathers, at times appointed
        year by year, to burn upon the altar of the LORD our God, as
        it is written in the law:

010:035 And to bring the firstfruits of our ground, and the
        firstfruits of all fruit of all trees, year by year, unto the
        house of the LORD:

010:036 Also the firstborn of our sons, and of our cattle, as it is
        written in the law, and the firstlings of our herds and of our
        flocks, to bring to the house of our God, unto the priests
        that minister in the house of our God:

010:037 And that we should bring the firstfruits of our dough, and our
        offerings, and the fruit of all manner of trees, of wine and
        of oil, unto the priests, to the chambers of the house of our
        God; and the tithes of our ground unto the Levites, that the
        same Levites might have the tithes in all the cities of our
        tillage.

010:038 And the priest the son of Aaron shall be with the Levites,
        when the Levites take tithes: and the Levites shall bring up
        the tithe of the tithes unto the house of our God, to the
        chambers, into the treasure house.

010:039 For the children of Israel and the children of Levi shall
        bring the offering of the corn, of the new wine, and the oil,
        unto the chambers, where are the vessels of the sanctuary, and
        the priests that minister, and the porters, and the singers:
        and we will not forsake the house of our God.

011:001 And the rulers of the people dwelt at Jerusalem: the rest of
        the people also cast lots, to bring one of ten to dwell in
        Jerusalem the holy city, and nine parts to dwell in other
        cities.

011:002 And the people blessed all the men, that willingly offered
        themselves to dwell at Jerusalem.

011:003 Now these are the chief of the province that dwelt in
        Jerusalem: but in the cities of Judah dwelt every one in his
        possession in their cities, to wit, Israel, the priests, and
        the Levites, and the Nethinims, and the children of Solomon's
        servants.

011:004 And at Jerusalem dwelt certain of the children of Judah, and
        of the children of Benjamin. Of the children of Judah; Athaiah
        the son of Uzziah, the son of Zechariah, the son of Amariah,
        the son of Shephatiah, the son of Mahalaleel, of the children
        of Perez;

011:005 And Maaseiah the son of Baruch, the son of Colhozeh, the son
        of Hazaiah, the son of Adaiah, the son of Joiarib, the son of
        Zechariah, the son of Shiloni.

011:006 All the sons of Perez that dwelt at Jerusalem were four
        hundred threescore and eight valiant men.

011:007 And these are the sons of Benjamin; Sallu the son of
        Meshullam, the son of Joed, the son of Pedaiah, the son of
        Kolaiah, the son of Maaseiah, the son of Ithiel, the son of
        Jesaiah.

011:008 And after him Gabbai, Sallai, nine hundred twenty and eight.

011:009 And Joel the son of Zichri was their overseer: and Judah the
        son of Senuah was second over the city.

011:010 Of the priests: Jedaiah the son of Joiarib, Jachin.

011:011 Seraiah the son of Hilkiah, the son of Meshullam, the son of
        Zadok, the son of Meraioth, the son of Ahitub, was the ruler
        of the house of God.

011:012 And their brethren that did the work of the house were eight
        hundred twenty and two: and Adaiah the son of Jeroham, the son
        of Pelaliah, the son of Amzi, the son of Zechariah, the son of
        Pashur, the son of Malchiah.

011:013 And his brethren, chief of the fathers, two hundred forty and
        two: and Amashai the son of Azareel, the son of Ahasai, the
        son of Meshillemoth, the son of Immer,

011:014 And their brethren, mighty men of valour, an hundred twenty
        and eight: and their overseer was Zabdiel, the son of one of
        the great men.

011:015 Also of the Levites: Shemaiah the son of Hashub, the son of
        Azrikam, the son of Hashabiah, the son of Bunni;

011:016 And Shabbethai and Jozabad, of the chief of the Levites, had
        the oversight of the outward business of the house of God.

011:017 And Mattaniah the son of Micha, the son of Zabdi, the son of
        Asaph, was the principal to begin the thanksgiving in prayer:
        and Bakbukiah the second among his brethren, and Abda the son
        of Shammua, the son of Galal, the son of Jeduthun.

011:018 All the Levites in the holy city were two hundred fourscore
        and four.

011:019 Moreover the porters, Akkub, Talmon, and their brethren that
        kept the gates, were an hundred seventy and two.

011:020 And the residue of Israel, of the priests, and the Levites,
        were in all the cities of Judah, every one in his inheritance.

011:021 But the Nethinims dwelt in Ophel: and Ziha and Gispa were over
        the Nethinims.

011:022 The overseer also of the Levites at Jerusalem was Uzzi the son
        of Bani, the son of Hashabiah, the son of Mattaniah, the son
        of Micha. Of the sons of Asaph, the singers were over the
        business of the house of God.

011:023 For it was the king's commandment concerning them, that a
        certain portion should be for the singers, due for every day.

011:024 And Pethahiah the son of Meshezabeel, of the children of Zerah
        the son of Judah, was at the king's hand in all matters
        concerning the people.

011:025 And for the villages, with their fields, some of the children
        of Judah dwelt at Kirjatharba, and in the villages thereof,
        and at Dibon, and in the villages thereof, and at Jekabzeel,
        and in the villages thereof,

011:026 And at Jeshua, and at Moladah, and at Bethphelet,

011:027 And at Hazarshual, and at Beersheba, and in the villages
        thereof,

011:028 And at Ziklag, and at Mekonah, and in the villages thereof,

011:029 And at Enrimmon, and at Zareah, and at Jarmuth,

011:030 Zanoah, Adullam, and in their villages, at Lachish, and the
        fields thereof, at Azekah, and in the villages thereof. And
        they dwelt from Beersheba unto the valley of Hinnom.

011:031 The children also of Benjamin from Geba dwelt at Michmash, and
        Aija, and Bethel, and in their villages.

011:032 And at Anathoth, Nob, Ananiah,

011:033 Hazor, Ramah, Gittaim,

011:034 Hadid, Zeboim, Neballat,

011:035 Lod, and Ono, the valley of craftsmen.

011:036 And of the Levites were divisions in Judah, and in Benjamin.

012:001 Now these are the priests and the Levites that went up with
        Zerubbabel the son of Shealtiel, and Jeshua: Seraiah,
        Jeremiah, Ezra,

012:002 Amariah, Malluch, Hattush,

012:003 Shechaniah, Rehum, Meremoth,

012:004 Iddo, Ginnetho, Abijah,

012:005 Miamin, Maadiah, Bilgah,

012:006 Shemaiah, and Joiarib, Jedaiah,

012:007 Sallu, Amok, Hilkiah, Jedaiah. These were the chief of the
        priests and of their brethren in the days of Jeshua.

012:008 Moreover the Levites: Jeshua, Binnui, Kadmiel, Sherebiah,
        Judah, and Mattaniah, which was over the thanksgiving, he and
        his brethren.

012:009 Also Bakbukiah and Unni, their brethren, were over against
        them in the watches.

012:010 And Jeshua begat Joiakim, Joiakim also begat Eliashib, and
        Eliashib begat Joiada,

012:011 And Joiada begat Jonathan, and Jonathan begat Jaddua.

012:012 And in the days of Joiakim were priests, the chief of the
        fathers: of Seraiah, Meraiah; of Jeremiah, Hananiah;

012:013 Of Ezra, Meshullam; of Amariah, Jehohanan;

012:014 Of Melicu, Jonathan; of Shebaniah, Joseph;

012:015 Of Harim, Adna; of Meraioth, Helkai;

012:016 Of Iddo, Zechariah; of Ginnethon, Meshullam;

012:017 Of Abijah, Zichri; of Miniamin, of Moadiah, Piltai:

012:018 Of Bilgah, Shammua; of Shemaiah, Jehonathan;

012:019 And of Joiarib, Mattenai; of Jedaiah, Uzzi;

012:020 Of Sallai, Kallai; of Amok, Eber;

012:021 Of Hilkiah, Hashabiah; of Jedaiah, Nethaneel.

012:022 The Levites in the days of Eliashib, Joiada, and Johanan, and
        Jaddua, were recorded chief of the fathers: also the priests,
        to the reign of Darius the Persian.

012:023 The sons of Levi, the chief of the fathers, were written in
        the book of the chronicles, even until the days of Johanan the
        son of Eliashib.

012:024 And the chief of the Levites: Hashabiah, Sherebiah, and Jeshua
        the son of Kadmiel, with their brethren over against them, to
        praise and to give thanks, according to the commandment of
        David the man of God, ward over against ward.

012:025 Mattaniah, and Bakbukiah, Obadiah, Meshullam, Talmon, Akkub,
        were porters keeping the ward at the thresholds of the gates.

012:026 These were in the days of Joiakim the son of Jeshua, the son
        of Jozadak, and in the days of Nehemiah the governor, and of
        Ezra the priest, the scribe.

012:027 And at the dedication of the wall of Jerusalem they sought the
        Levites out of all their places, to bring them to Jerusalem,
        to keep the dedication with gladness, both with thanksgivings,
        and with singing, with cymbals, psalteries, and with harps.

012:028 And the sons of the singers gathered themselves together, both
        out of the plain country round about Jerusalem, and from the
        villages of Netophathi;

012:029 Also from the house of Gilgal, and out of the fields of Geba
        and Azmaveth: for the singers had builded them villages round
        about Jerusalem.

012:030 And the priests and the Levites purified themselves, and
        purified the people, and the gates, and the wall.

012:031 Then I brought up the princes of Judah upon the wall, and
        appointed two great companies of them that gave thanks,
        whereof one went on the right hand upon the wall toward the
        dung gate:

012:032 And after them went Hoshaiah, and half of the princes of
        Judah,

012:033 And Azariah, Ezra, and Meshullam,

012:034 Judah, and Benjamin, and Shemaiah, and Jeremiah,

012:035 And certain of the priests' sons with trumpets; namely,
        Zechariah the son of Jonathan, the son of Shemaiah, the son of
        Mattaniah, the son of Michaiah, the son of Zaccur, the son of
        Asaph:

012:036 And his brethren, Shemaiah, and Azarael, Milalai, Gilalai,
        Maai, Nethaneel, and Judah, Hanani, with the musical
        instruments of David the man of God, and Ezra the scribe
        before them.

012:037 And at the fountain gate, which was over against them, they
        went up by the stairs of the city of David, at the going up of
        the wall, above the house of David, even unto the water gate
        eastward.

012:038 And the other company of them that gave thanks went over
        against them, and I after them, and the half of the people
        upon the wall, from beyond the tower of the furnaces even unto
        the broad wall;

012:039 And from above the gate of Ephraim, and above the old gate,
        and above the fish gate, and the tower of Hananeel, and the
        tower of Meah, even unto the sheep gate: and they stood still
        in the prison gate.

012:040 So stood the two companies of them that gave thanks in the
        house of God, and I, and the half of the rulers with me:

012:041 And the priests; Eliakim, Maaseiah, Miniamin, Michaiah,
        Elioenai, Zechariah, and Hananiah, with trumpets;

012:042 And Maaseiah, and Shemaiah, and Eleazar, and Uzzi, and
        Jehohanan, and Malchijah, and Elam, and Ezer. And the singers
        sang loud, with Jezrahiah their overseer.

012:043 Also that day they offered great sacrifices, and rejoiced: for
        God had made them rejoice with great joy: the wives also and
        the children rejoiced: so that the joy of Jerusalem was heard
        even afar off.

012:044 And at that time were some appointed over the chambers for the
        treasures, for the offerings, for the firstfruits, and for the
        tithes, to gather into them out of the fields of the cities
        the portions of the law for the priests and Levites: for Judah
        rejoiced for the priests and for the Levites that waited.

012:045 And both the singers and the porters kept the ward of their
        God, and the ward of the purification, according to the
        commandment of David, and of Solomon his son.

012:046 For in the days of David and Asaph of old there were chief of
        the singers, and songs of praise and thanksgiving unto God.

012:047 And all Israel in the days of Zerubbabel, and in the days of
        Nehemiah, gave the portions of the singers and the porters,
        every day his portion: and they sanctified holy things unto
        the Levites; and the Levites sanctified them unto the children
        of Aaron.

013:001 On that day they read in the book of Moses in the audience of
        the people; and therein was found written, that the Ammonite
        and the Moabite should not come into the congregation of God
        for ever;

013:002 Because they met not the children of Israel with bread and
        with water, but hired Balaam against them, that he should
        curse them: howbeit our God turned the curse into a blessing.

013:003 Now it came to pass, when they had heard the law, that they
        separated from Israel all the mixed multitude.

013:004 And before this, Eliashib the priest, having the oversight of
        the chamber of the house of our God, was allied unto Tobiah:

013:005 And he had prepared for him a great chamber, where aforetime
        they laid the meat offerings, the frankincense, and the
        vessels, and the tithes of the corn, the new wine, and the
        oil, which was commanded to be given to the Levites, and the
        singers, and the porters; and the offerings of the priests.

013:006 But in all this time was not I at Jerusalem: for in the two
        and thirtieth year of Artaxerxes king of Babylon came I unto
        the king, and after certain days obtained I leave of the king:

013:007 And I came to Jerusalem, and understood of the evil that
        Eliashib did for Tobiah, in preparing him a chamber in the
        courts of the house of God.

013:008 And it grieved me sore: therefore I cast forth all the
        household stuff to Tobiah out of the chamber.

013:009 Then I commanded, and they cleansed the chambers: and thither
        brought I again the vessels of the house of God, with the meat
        offering and the frankincense.

013:010 And I perceived that the portions of the Levites had not been
        given them: for the Levites and the singers, that did the
        work, were fled every one to his field.

013:011 Then contended I with the rulers, and said, Why is the house
        of God forsaken? And I gathered them together, and set them in
        their place.

013:012 Then brought all Judah the tithe of the corn and the new wine
        and the oil unto the treasuries.

013:013 And I made treasurers over the treasuries, Shelemiah the
        priest, and Zadok the scribe, and of the Levites, Pedaiah: and
        next to them was Hanan the son of Zaccur, the son of
        Mattaniah: for they were counted faithful, and their office
        was to distribute unto their brethren.

013:014 Remember me, O my God, concerning this, and wipe not out my
        good deeds that I have done for the house of my God, and for
        the offices thereof.

013:015 In those days saw I in Judah some treading wine presses on the
        sabbath, and bringing in sheaves, and lading asses; as also
        wine, grapes, and figs, and all manner of burdens, which they
        brought into Jerusalem on the sabbath day: and I testified
        against them in the day wherein they sold victuals.

013:016 There dwelt men of Tyre also therein, which brought fish, and
        all manner of ware, and sold on the sabbath unto the children
        of Judah, and in Jerusalem.

013:017 Then I contended with the nobles of Judah, and said unto them,
        What evil thing is this that ye do, and profane the sabbath
        day?

013:018 Did not your fathers thus, and did not our God bring all this
        evil upon us, and upon this city? yet ye bring more wrath upon
        Israel by profaning the sabbath.

013:019 And it came to pass, that when the gates of Jerusalem began to
        be dark before the sabbath, I commanded that the gates should
        be shut, and charged that they should not be opened till after
        the sabbath: and some of my servants set I at the gates, that
        there should no burden be brought in on the sabbath day.

013:020 So the merchants and sellers of all kind of ware lodged
        without Jerusalem once or twice.

013:021 Then I testified against them, and said unto them, Why lodge
        ye about the wall? if ye do so again, I will lay hands on you.
        From that time forth came they no more on the sabbath.

013:022 And I commanded the Levites that they should cleanse
        themselves, and that they should come and keep the gates, to
        sanctify the sabbath day. Remember me, O my God, concerning
        this also, and spare me according to the greatness of thy
        mercy.

013:023 In those days also saw I Jews that had married wives of
        Ashdod, of Ammon, and of Moab:

013:024 And their children spake half in the speech of Ashdod, and
        could not speak in the Jews' language, but according to the
        language of each people.

013:025 And I contended with them, and cursed them, and smote certain
        of them, and plucked off their hair, and made them swear by
        God, saying, Ye shall not give your daughters unto their sons,
        nor take their daughters unto your sons, or for yourselves.

013:026 Did not Solomon king of Israel sin by these things? yet among
        many nations was there no king like him, who was beloved of
        his God, and God made him king over all Israel: nevertheless
        even him did outlandish women cause to sin.

013:027 Shall we then hearken unto you to do all this great evil, to
        transgress against our God in marrying strange wives?

013:028 And one of the sons of Joiada, the son of Eliashib the high
        priest, was son in law to Sanballat the Horonite: therefore I
        chased him from me.

013:029 Remember them, O my God, because they have defiled the
        priesthood, and the covenant of the priesthood, and of the
        Levites.

013:030 Thus cleansed I them from all strangers, and appointed the
        wards of the priests and the Levites, every one in his
        business;

013:031 And for the wood offering, at times appointed, and for the
        firstfruits. Remember me, O my God, for good.

Book 17	Esther

001:001 Now it came to pass in the days of Ahasuerus, (this is
        Ahasuerus which reigned, from India even unto Ethiopia, over
        an hundred and seven and twenty provinces:)

001:002 That in those days, when the king Ahasuerus sat on the throne
        of his kingdom, which was in Shushan the palace,

001:003 In the third year of his reign, he made a feast unto all his
        princes and his servants; the power of Persia and Media, the
        nobles and princes of the provinces, being before him:

001:004 When he shewed the riches of his glorious kingdom and the
        honour of his excellent majesty many days, even an hundred and
        fourscore days.

001:005 And when these days were expired, the king made a feast unto
        all the people that were present in Shushan the palace, both
        unto great and small, seven days, in the court of the garden
        of the king's palace;

001:006 Where were white, green, and blue, hangings, fastened with
        cords of fine linen and purple to silver rings and pillars of
        marble: the beds were of gold and silver, upon a pavement of
        red, and blue, and white, and black, marble.

001:007 And they gave them drink in vessels of gold, (the vessels
        being diverse one from another,) and royal wine in abundance,
        according to the state of the king.

001:008 And the drinking was according to the law; none did compel:
        for so the king had appointed to all the officers of his
        house, that they should do according to every man's pleasure.

001:009 Also Vashti the queen made a feast for the women in the royal
        house which belonged to king Ahasuerus.

001:010 On the seventh day, when the heart of the king was merry with
        wine, he commanded Mehuman, Biztha, Harbona, Bigtha, and
        Abagtha, Zethar, and Carcas, the seven chamberlains that
        served in the presence of Ahasuerus the king,

001:011 To bring Vashti the queen before the king with the crown
        royal, to shew the people and the princes her beauty: for she
        was fair to look on.

001:012 But the queen Vashti refused to come at the king's commandment
        by his chamberlains: therefore was the king very wroth, and
        his anger burned in him.

001:013 Then the king said to the wise men, which knew the times, (for
        so was the king's manner toward all that knew law and
        judgment:

001:014 And the next unto him was Carshena, Shethar, Admatha,
        Tarshish, Meres, Marsena, and Memucan, the seven princes of
        Persia and Media, which saw the king's face, and which sat the
        first in the kingdom;)

001:015 What shall we do unto the queen Vashti according to law,
        because she hath not performed the commandment of the king
        Ahasuerus by the chamberlains?

001:016 And Memucan answered before the king and the princes, Vashti
        the queen hath not done wrong to the king only, but also to
        all the princes, and to all the people that are in all the
        provinces of the king Ahasuerus.

001:017 For this deed of the queen shall come abroad unto all women,
        so that they shall despise their husbands in their eyes, when
        it shall be reported, The king Ahasuerus commanded Vashti the
        queen to be brought in before him, but she came not.

001:018 Likewise shall the ladies of Persia and Media say this day
        unto all the king's princes, which have heard of the deed of
        the queen. Thus shall there arise too much contempt and wrath.

001:019 If it please the king, let there go a royal commandment from
        him, and let it be written among the laws of the Persians and
        the Medes, that it be not altered, That Vashti come no more
        before king Ahasuerus; and let the king give her royal estate
        unto another that is better than she.

001:020 And when the king's decree which he shall make shall be
        published throughout all his empire, (for it is great,) all
        the wives shall give to their husbands honour, both to great
        and small.

001:021 And the saying pleased the king and the princes; and the king
        did according to the word of Memucan:

001:022 For he sent letters into all the king's provinces, into every
        province according to the writing thereof, and to every people
        after their language, that every man should bear rule in his
        own house, and that it should be published according to the
        language of every people.

002:001 After these things, when the wrath of king Ahasuerus was
        appeased, he remembered Vashti, and what she had done, and
        what was decreed against her.

002:002 Then said the king's servants that ministered unto him, Let
        there be fair young virgins sought for the king:

002:003 And let the king appoint officers in all the provinces of his
        kingdom, that they may gather together all the fair young
        virgins unto Shushan the palace, to the house of the women,
        unto the custody of Hege the king's chamberlain, keeper of the
        women; and let their things for purification be given them:

002:004 And let the maiden which pleaseth the king be queen instead of
        Vashti. And the thing pleased the king; and he did so.

002:005 Now in Shushan the palace there was a certain Jew, whose name
        was Mordecai, the son of Jair, the son of Shimei, the son of
        Kish, a Benjamite;

002:006 Who had been carried away from Jerusalem with the captivity
        which had been carried away with Jeconiah king of Judah, whom
        Nebuchadnezzar the king of Babylon had carried away.

002:007 And he brought up Hadassah, that is, Esther, his uncle's
        daughter: for she had neither father nor mother, and the maid
        was fair and beautiful; whom Mordecai, when her father and
        mother were dead, took for his own daughter.

002:008 So it came to pass, when the king's commandment and his decree
        was heard, and when many maidens were gathered together unto
        Shushan the palace, to the custody of Hegai, that Esther was
        brought also unto the king's house, to the custody of Hegai,
        keeper of the women.

002:009 And the maiden pleased him, and she obtained kindness of him;
        and he speedily gave her her things for purification, with
        such things as belonged to her, and seven maidens, which were
        meet to be given her, out of the king's house: and he
        preferred her and her maids unto the best place of the house
        of the women.

002:010 Esther had not shewed her people nor her kindred: for Mordecai
        had charged her that she should not shew it.

002:011 And Mordecai walked every day before the court of the women's
        house, to know how Esther did, and what should become of her.

002:012 Now when every maid's turn was come to go in to king
        Ahasuerus, after that she had been twelve months, according to
        the manner of the women, (for so were the days of their
        purifications accomplished, to wit, six months with oil of
        myrrh, and six months with sweet odours, and with other things
        for the purifying of the women;)

002:013 Then thus came every maiden unto the king; whatsoever she
        desired was given her to go with her out of the house of the
        women unto the king's house.

002:014 In the evening she went, and on the morrow she returned into
        the second house of the women, to the custody of Shaashgaz,
        the king's chamberlain, which kept the concubines: she came in
        unto the king no more, except the king delighted in her, and
        that she were called by name.

002:015 Now when the turn of Esther, the daughter of Abihail the uncle
        of Mordecai, who had taken her for his daughter, was come to
        go in unto the king, she required nothing but what Hegai the
        king's chamberlain, the keeper of the women, appointed. And
        Esther obtained favour in the sight of all them that looked
        upon her.

002:016 So Esther was taken unto king Ahasuerus into his house royal
        in the tenth month, which is the month Tebeth, in the seventh
        year of his reign.

002:017 And the king loved Esther above all the women, and she
        obtained grace and favour in his sight more than all the
        virgins; so that he set the royal crown upon her head, and
        made her queen instead of Vashti.

002:018 Then the king made a great feast unto all his princes and his
        servants, even Esther's feast; and he made a release to the
        provinces, and gave gifts, according to the state of the king.

002:019 And when the virgins were gathered together the second time,
        then Mordecai sat in the king's gate.

002:020 Esther had not yet shewed her kindred nor her people; as
        Mordecai had charged her: for Esther did the commandment of
        Mordecai, like as when she was brought up with him.

002:021 In those days, while Mordecai sat in the king's gate, two of
        the king's chamberlains, Bigthan and Teresh, of those which
        kept the door, were wroth, and sought to lay hands on the king
        Ahasuerus.

002:022 And the thing was known to Mordecai, who told it unto Esther
        the queen; and Esther certified the king thereof in Mordecai's
        name.

002:023 And when inquisition was made of the matter, it was found out;
        therefore they were both hanged on a tree: and it was written
        in the book of the chronicles before the king.

003:001 After these things did king Ahasuerus promote Haman the son of
        Hammedatha the Agagite, and advanced him, and set his seat
        above all the princes that were with him.

003:002 And all the king's servants, that were in the king's gate,
        bowed, and reverenced Haman: for the king had so commanded
        concerning him. But Mordecai bowed not, nor did him reverence.

003:003 Then the king's servants, which were in the king's gate, said
        unto Mordecai, Why transgressest thou the king's commandment?

003:004 Now it came to pass, when they spake daily unto him, and he
        hearkened not unto them, that they told Haman, to see whether
        Mordecai's matters would stand: for he had told them that he
        was a Jew.

003:005 And when Haman saw that Mordecai bowed not, nor did him
        reverence, then was Haman full of wrath.

003:006 And he thought scorn to lay hands on Mordecai alone; for they
        had shewed him the people of Mordecai: wherefore Haman sought
        to destroy all the Jews that were throughout the whole kingdom
        of Ahasuerus, even the people of Mordecai.

003:007 In the first month, that is, the month Nisan, in the twelfth
        year of king Ahasuerus, they cast Pur, that is, the lot,
        before Haman from day to day, and from month to month, to the
        twelfth month, that is, the month Adar.

003:008 And Haman said unto king Ahasuerus, There is a certain people
        scattered abroad and dispersed among the people in all the
        provinces of thy kingdom; and their laws are diverse from all
        people; neither keep they the king's laws: therefore it is not
        for the king's profit to suffer them.

003:009 If it please the king, let it be written that they may be
        destroyed: and I will pay ten thousand talents of silver to
        the hands of those that have the charge of the business, to
        bring it into the king's treasuries.

003:010 And the king took his ring from his hand, and gave it unto
        Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, the Jews' enemy.

003:011 And the king said unto Haman, The silver is given to thee, the
        people also, to do with them as it seemeth good to thee.

003:012 Then were the king's scribes called on the thirteenth day of
        the first month, and there was written according to all that
        Haman had commanded unto the king's lieutenants, and to the
        governors that were over every province, and to the rulers of
        every people of every province according to the writing
        thereof, and to every people after their language; in the name
        of king Ahasuerus was it written, and sealed with the king's
        ring.

003:013 And the letters were sent by posts into all the king's
        provinces, to destroy, to kill, and to cause to perish, all
        Jews, both young and old, little children and women, in one
        day, even upon the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which
        is the month Adar, and to take the spoil of them for a prey.

003:014 The copy of the writing for a commandment to be given in every
        province was published unto all people, that they should be
        ready against that day.

003:015 The posts went out, being hastened by the king's commandment,
        and the decree was given in Shushan the palace. And the king
        and Haman sat down to drink; but the city Shushan was
        perplexed.

004:001 When Mordecai perceived all that was done, Mordecai rent his
        clothes, and put on sackcloth with ashes, and went out into
        the midst of the city, and cried with a loud and a bitter cry;

004:002 And came even before the king's gate: for none might enter
        into the king's gate clothed with sackcloth.

004:003 And in every province, whithersoever the king's commandment
        and his decree came, there was great mourning among the Jews,
        and fasting, and weeping, and wailing; and many lay in
        sackcloth and ashes.

004:004 So Esther's maids and her chamberlains came and told it her.
        Then was the queen exceedingly grieved; and she sent raiment
        to clothe Mordecai, and to take away his sackcloth from him:
        but he received it not.

004:005 Then called Esther for Hatach, one of the king's chamberlains,
        whom he had appointed to attend upon her, and gave him a
        commandment to Mordecai, to know what it was, and why it was.

004:006 So Hatach went forth to Mordecai unto the street of the city,
        which was before the king's gate.

004:007 And Mordecai told him of all that had happened unto him, and
        of the sum of the money that Haman had promised to pay to the
        king's treasuries for the Jews, to destroy them.

004:008 Also he gave him the copy of the writing of the decree that
        was given at Shushan to destroy them, to shew it unto Esther,
        and to declare it unto her, and to charge her that she should
        go in unto the king, to make supplication unto him, and to
        make request before him for her people.

004:009 And Hatach came and told Esther the words of Mordecai.

004:010 Again Esther spake unto Hatach, and gave him commandment unto
        Mordecai;

004:011 All the king's servants, and the people of the king's
        provinces, do know, that whosoever, whether man or women,
        shall come unto the king into the inner court, who is not
        called, there is one law of his to put him to death, except
        such to whom the king shall hold out the golden sceptre, that
        he may live: but I have not been called to come in unto the
        king these thirty days.

004:012 And they told to Mordecai Esther's words.

004:013 Then Mordecai commanded to answer Esther, Think not with
        thyself that thou shalt escape in the king's house, more than
        all the Jews.

004:014 For if thou altogether holdest thy peace at this time, then
        shall there enlargement and deliverance arise to the Jews from
        another place; but thou and thy father's house shall be
        destroyed: and who knoweth whether thou art come to the
        kingdom for such a time as this?

004:015 Then Esther bade them return Mordecai this answer,

004:016 Go, gather together all the Jews that are present in Shushan,
        and fast ye for me, and neither eat nor drink three days,
        night or day: I also and my maidens will fast likewise; and so
        will I go in unto the king, which is not according to the law:
        and if I perish, I perish.

004:017 So Mordecai went his way, and did according to all that Esther
        had commanded him.
