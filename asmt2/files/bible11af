005:001 Now it came to pass on the third day, that Esther put on her
        royal apparel, and stood in the inner court of the king's
        house, over against the king's house: and the king sat upon
        his royal throne in the royal house, over against the gate of
        the house.

005:002 And it was so, when the king saw Esther the queen standing in
        the court, that she obtained favour in his sight: and the king
        held out to Esther the golden sceptre that was in his hand. So
        Esther drew near, and touched the top of the sceptre.

005:003 Then said the king unto her, What wilt thou, queen Esther? and
        what is thy request? it shall be even given thee to the half
        of the kingdom.

005:004 And Esther answered, If it seem good unto the king, let the
        king and Haman come this day unto the banquet that I have
        prepared for him.

005:005 Then the king said, Cause Haman to make haste, that he may do
        as Esther hath said. So the king and Haman came to the banquet
        that Esther had prepared.

005:006 And the king said unto Esther at the banquet of wine, What is
        thy petition? and it shall be granted thee: and what is thy
        request? even to the half of the kingdom it shall be
        performed.

005:007 Then answered Esther, and said, My petition and my request is;

005:008 If I have found favour in the sight of the king, and if it
        please the king to grant my petition, and to perform my
        request, let the king and Haman come to the banquet that I
        shall prepare for them, and I will do to morrow as the king
        hath said.

005:009 Then went Haman forth that day joyful and with a glad heart:
        but when Haman saw Mordecai in the king's gate, that he stood
        not up, nor moved for him, he was full of indignation against
        Mordecai.

005:010 Nevertheless Haman refrained himself: and when he came home,
        he sent and called for his friends, and Zeresh his wife.

005:011 And Haman told them of the glory of his riches, and the
        multitude of his children, and all the things wherein the king
        had promoted him, and how he had advanced him above the
        princes and servants of the king.

005:012 Haman said moreover, Yea, Esther the queen did let no man come
        in with the king unto the banquet that she had prepared but
        myself; and to morrow am I invited unto her also with the
        king.

005:013 Yet all this availeth me nothing, so long as I see Mordecai
        the Jew sitting at the king's gate.

005:014 Then said Zeresh his wife and all his friends unto him, Let a
        gallows be made of fifty cubits high, and to morrow speak thou
        unto the king that Mordecai may be hanged thereon: then go
        thou in merrily with the king unto the banquet. And the thing
        pleased Haman; and he caused the gallows to be made.

006:001 On that night could not the king sleep, and he commanded to
        bring the book of records of the chronicles; and they were
        read before the king.

006:002 And it was found written, that Mordecai had told of Bigthana
        and Teresh, two of the king's chamberlains, the keepers of the
        door, who sought to lay hand on the king Ahasuerus.

006:003 And the king said, What honour and dignity hath been done to
        Mordecai for this? Then said the king's servants that
        ministered unto him, There is nothing done for him.

006:004 And the king said, Who is in the court? Now Haman was come
        into the outward court of the king's house, to speak unto the
        king to hang Mordecai on the gallows that he had prepared for
        him.

006:005 And the king's servants said unto him, Behold, Haman standeth
        in the court. And the king said, Let him come in.

006:006 So Haman came in. And the king said unto him, What shall be
        done unto the man whom the king delighteth to honour? Now
        Haman thought in his heart, To whom would the king delight to
        do honour more than to myself?

006:007 And Haman answered the king, For the man whom the king
        delighteth to honour,

006:008 Let the royal apparel be brought which the king useth to wear,
        and the horse that the king rideth upon, and the crown royal
        which is set upon his head:

006:009 And let this apparel and horse be delivered to the hand of one
        of the king's most noble princes, that they may array the man
        withal whom the king delighteth to honour, and bring him on
        horseback through the street of the city, and proclaim before
        him, Thus shall it be done to the man whom the king delighteth
        to honour.

006:010 Then the king said to Haman, Make haste, and take the apparel
        and the horse, as thou hast said, and do even so to Mordecai
        the Jew, that sitteth at the king's gate: let nothing fail of
        all that thou hast spoken.

006:011 Then took Haman the apparel and the horse, and arrayed
        Mordecai, and brought him on horseback through the street of
        the city, and proclaimed before him, Thus shall it be done
        unto the man whom the king delighteth to honour.

006:012 And Mordecai came again to the king's gate. But Haman hasted
        to his house mourning, and having his head covered.

006:013 And Haman told Zeresh his wife and all his friends every thing
        that had befallen him. Then said his wise men and Zeresh his
        wife unto him, If Mordecai be of the seed of the Jews, before
        whom thou hast begun to fall, thou shalt not prevail against
        him, but shalt surely fall before him.

006:014 And while they were yet talking with him, came the king's
        chamberlains, and hasted to bring Haman unto the banquet that
        Esther had prepared.

007:001 So the king and Haman came to banquet with Esther the queen.

007:002 And the king said again unto Esther on the second day at the
        banquet of wine, What is thy petition, queen Esther? and it
        shall be granted thee: and what is thy request? and it shall
        be performed, even to the half of the kingdom.

007:003 Then Esther the queen answered and said, If I have found
        favour in thy sight, O king, and if it please the king, let my
        life be given me at my petition, and my people at my request:

007:004 For we are sold, I and my people, to be destroyed, to be
        slain, and to perish. But if we had been sold for bondmen and
        bondwomen, I had held my tongue, although the enemy could not
        countervail the king's damage.

007:005 Then the king Ahasuerus answered and said unto Esther the
        queen, Who is he, and where is he, that durst presume in his
        heart to do so?

007:006 And Esther said, The adversary and enemy is this wicked Haman.
        Then Haman was afraid before the king and the queen.

007:007 And the king arising from the banquet of wine in his wrath
        went into the palace garden: and Haman stood up to make
        request for his life to Esther the queen; for he saw that
        there was evil determined against him by the king.

007:008 Then the king returned out of the palace garden into the place
        of the banquet of wine; and Haman was fallen upon the bed
        whereon Esther was. Then said the king, Will he force the
        queen also before me in the house? As the word went out of
        king's mouth, they covered Haman's face.

007:009 And Harbonah, one of the chamberlains, said before the king,
        Behold also, the gallows fifty cubits high, which Haman had
        made for Mordecai, who spoken good for the king, standeth in
        the house of Haman. Then the king said, Hang him thereon.

007:010 So they hanged Haman on the gallows that he had prepared for
        Mordecai. Then was the king's wrath pacified.

008:001 On that day did the king Ahasuerus give the house of Haman the
        Jews' enemy unto Esther the queen. And Mordecai came before
        the king; for Esther had told what he was unto her.

008:002 And the king took off his ring, which he had taken from Haman,
        and gave it unto Mordecai. And Esther set Mordecai over the
        house of Haman.

008:003 And Esther spake yet again before the king, and fell down at
        his feet, and besought him with tears to put away the mischief
        of Haman the Agagite, and his device that he had devised
        against the Jews.

008:004 Then the king held out the golden sceptre toward Esther. So
        Esther arose, and stood before the king,

008:005 And said, If it please the king, and if I have favour in his
        sight, and the thing seem right before the king, and I be
        pleasing in his eyes, let it be written to reverse the letters
        devised by Haman the son of Hammedatha the Agagite, which he
        wrote to destroy the Jews which are in all the king's
        provinces:

008:006 For how can I endure to see the evil that shall come unto my
        people? or how can I endure to see the destruction of my
        kindred?

008:007 Then the king Ahasuerus said unto Esther the queen and to
        Mordecai the Jew, Behold, I have given Esther the house of
        Haman, and him they have hanged upon the gallows, because he
        laid his hand upon the Jews.

008:008 Write ye also for the Jews, as it liketh you, in the king's
        name, and seal it with the king's ring: for the writing which
        is written in the king's name, and sealed with the king's
        ring, may no man reverse.

008:009 Then were the king's scribes called at that time in the third
        month, that is, the month Sivan, on the three and twentieth
        day thereof; and it was written according to all that Mordecai
        commanded unto the Jews, and to the lieutenants, and the
        deputies and rulers of the provinces which are from India unto
        Ethiopia, an hundred twenty and seven provinces, unto every
        province according to the writing thereof, and unto every
        people after their language, and to the Jews according to
        their writing, and according to their language.

008:010 And he wrote in the king Ahasuerus' name, and sealed it with
        the king's ring, and sent letters by posts on horseback, and
        riders on mules, camels, and young dromedaries:

008:011 Wherein the king granted the Jews which were in every city to
        gather themselves together, and to stand for their life, to
        destroy, to slay and to cause to perish, all the power of the
        people and province that would assault them, both little ones
        and women, and to take the spoil of them for a prey,

008:012 Upon one day in all the provinces of king Ahasuerus, namely,
        upon the thirteenth day of the twelfth month, which is the
        month Adar.

008:013 The copy of the writing for a commandment to be given in every
        province was published unto all people, and that the Jews
        should be ready against that day to avenge themselves on their
        enemies.

008:014 So the posts that rode upon mules and camels went out, being
        hastened and pressed on by the king's commandment. And the
        decree was given at Shushan the palace.

008:015 And Mordecai went out from the presence of the king in royal
        apparel of blue and white, and with a great crown of gold, and
        with a garment of fine linen and purple: and the city of
        Shushan rejoiced and was glad.

008:016 The Jews had light, and gladness, and joy, and honour.

008:017 And in every province, and in every city, whithersoever the
        king's commandment and his decree came, the Jews had joy and
        gladness, a feast and a good day. And many of the people of
        the land became Jews; for the fear of the Jews fell upon them.

009:001 Now in the twelfth month, that is, the month Adar, on the
        thirteenth day of the same, when the king's commandment and
        his decree drew near to be put in execution, in the day that
        the enemies of the Jews hoped to have power over them, (though
        it was turned to the contrary, that the Jews had rule over
        them that hated them;)

009:002 The Jews gathered themselves together in their cities
        throughout all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus, to lay
        hand on such as sought their hurt: and no man could withstand
        them; for the fear of them fell upon all people.

009:003 And all the rulers of the provinces, and the lieutenants, and
        the deputies, and officers of the king, helped the Jews;
        because the fear of Mordecai fell upon them.

009:004 For Mordecai was great in the king's house, and his fame went
        out throughout all the provinces: for this man Mordecai waxed
        greater and greater.

009:005 Thus the Jews smote all their enemies with the stroke of the
        sword, and slaughter, and destruction, and did what they would
        unto those that hated them.

009:006 And in Shushan the palace the Jews slew and destroyed five
        hundred men.

009:007 And Parshandatha, and Dalphon, and Aspatha,

009:008 And Poratha, and Adalia, and Aridatha,

009:009 And Parmashta, and Arisai, and Aridai, and Vajezatha,

009:010 The ten sons of Haman the son of Hammedatha, the enemy of the
        Jews, slew they; but on the spoil laid they not their hand.

009:011 On that day the number of those that were slain in Shushan the
        palace was brought before the king.

009:012 And the king said unto Esther the queen, The Jews have slain
        and destroyed five hundred men in Shushan the palace, and the
        ten sons of Haman; what have they done in the rest of the
        king's provinces? now what is thy petition? and it shall be
        granted thee: or what is thy request further? and it shall be
        done.

009:013 Then said Esther, If it please the king, let it be granted to
        the Jews which are in Shushan to do to morrow also according
        unto this day's decree, and let Haman's ten sons be hanged
        upon the gallows.

009:014 And the king commanded it so to be done: and the decree was
        given at Shushan; and they hanged Haman's ten sons.

009:015 For the Jews that were in Shushan gathered themselves together
        on the fourteenth day also of the month Adar, and slew three
        hundred men at Shushan; but on the prey they laid not their
        hand.

009:016 But the other Jews that were in the king's provinces gathered
        themselves together, and stood for their lives, and had rest
        from their enemies, and slew of their foes seventy and five
        thousand, but they laid not their hands on the prey,

009:017 On the thirteenth day of the month Adar; and on the fourteenth
        day of the same rested they, and made it a day of feasting and
        gladness.

009:018 But the Jews that were at Shushan assembled together on the
        thirteenth day thereof, and on the fourteenth thereof; and on
        the fifteenth day of the same they rested, and made it a day
        of feasting and gladness.

009:019 Therefore the Jews of the villages, that dwelt in the unwalled
        towns, made the fourteenth day of the month Adar a day of
        gladness and feasting, and a good day, and of sending portions
        one to another.

009:020 And Mordecai wrote these things, and sent letters unto all the
        Jews that were in all the provinces of the king Ahasuerus,
        both nigh and far,

009:021 To stablish this among them, that they should keep the
        fourteenth day of the month Adar, and the fifteenth day of the
        same, yearly,

009:022 As the days wherein the Jews rested from their enemies, and
        the month which was turned unto them from sorrow to joy, and
        from mourning into a good day: that they should make them days
        of feasting and joy, and of sending portions one to another,
        and gifts to the poor.

009:023 And the Jews undertook to do as they had begun, and as
        Mordecai had written unto them;

009:024 Because Haman the son of Hammedatha, the Agagite, the enemy of
        all the Jews, had devised against the Jews to destroy them,
        and had cast Pur, that is, the lot, to consume them, and to
        destroy them;

009:025 But when Esther came before the king, he commanded by letters
        that his wicked device, which he devised against the Jews,
        should return upon his own head, and that he and his sons
        should be hanged on the gallows.

009:026 Wherefore they called these days Purim after the name of Pur.
        Therefore for all the words of this letter, and of that which
        they had seen concerning this matter, and which had come unto
        them,

009:027 The Jews ordained, and took upon them, and upon their seed,
        and upon all such as joined themselves unto them, so as it
        should not fail, that they would keep these two days according
        to their writing, and according to their appointed time every
        year;

009:028 And that these days should be remembered and kept throughout
        every generation, every family, every province, and every
        city; and that these days of Purim should not fail from among
        the Jews, nor the memorial of them perish from their seed.

009:029 Then Esther the queen, the daughter of Abihail, and Mordecai
        the Jew, wrote with all authority, to confirm this second
        letter of Purim.

009:030 And he sent the letters unto all the Jews, to the hundred
        twenty and seven provinces of the kingdom of Ahasuerus, with
        words of peace and truth,

009:031 To confirm these days of Purim in their times appointed,
        according as Mordecai the Jew and Esther the queen had
        enjoined them, and as they had decreed for themselves and for
        their seed, the matters of the fastings and their cry.

009:032 And the decree of Esther confirmed these matters of Purim; and
        it was written in the book.

010:001 And the king Ahasuerus laid a tribute upon the land, and upon
        the isles of the sea.

010:002 And all the acts of his power and of his might, and the
        declaration of the greatness of Mordecai, whereunto the king
        advanced him, are they not written in the book of the
        chronicles of the kings of Media and Persia?

010:003 For Mordecai the Jew was next unto king Ahasuerus, and great
        among the Jews, and accepted of the multitude of his brethren,
        seeking the wealth of his people, and speaking peace to all
        his seed.

Book 18	Job

001:001 There was a man in the land of Uz, whose name was Job; and
        that man was perfect and upright, and one that feared God, and
        eschewed evil.

001:002 And there were born unto him seven sons and three daughters.

001:003 His substance also was seven thousand sheep, and three
        thousand camels, and five hundred yoke of oxen, and five
        hundred she asses, and a very great household; so that this
        man was the greatest of all the men of the east.

001:004 And his sons went and feasted in their houses, every one his
        day; and sent and called for their three sisters to eat and to
        drink with them.

001:005 And it was so, when the days of their feasting were gone
        about, that Job sent and sanctified them, and rose up early in
        the morning, and offered burnt offerings according to the
        number of them all: for Job said, It may be that my sons have
        sinned, and cursed God in their hearts. Thus did Job
        continually.

001:006 Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present
        themselves before the LORD, and Satan came also among them.

001:007 And the LORD said unto Satan, Whence comest thou? Then Satan
        answered the LORD, and said, From going to and fro in the
        earth, and from walking up and down in it.

001:008 And the LORD said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant
        Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and
        an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil?

001:009 Then Satan answered the LORD, and said, Doth Job fear God for
        nought?

001:010 Hast not thou made an hedge about him, and about his house,
        and about all that he hath on every side? thou hast blessed
        the work of his hands, and his substance is increased in the
        land.

001:011 But put forth thine hand now, and touch all that he hath, and
        he will curse thee to thy face.

001:012 And the LORD said unto Satan, Behold, all that he hath is in
        thy power; only upon himself put not forth thine hand. So
        Satan went forth from the presence of the LORD.

001:013 And there was a day when his sons and his daughters were
        eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house:

001:014 And there came a messenger unto Job, and said, The oxen were
        plowing, and the asses feeding beside them:

001:015 And the Sabeans fell upon them, and took them away; yea, they
        have slain the servants with the edge of the sword; and I only
        am escaped alone to tell thee.

001:016 While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said,
        The fire of God is fallen from heaven, and hath burned up the
        sheep, and the servants, and consumed them; and I only am
        escaped alone to tell thee.

001:017 While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said,
        The Chaldeans made out three bands, and fell upon the camels,
        and have carried them away, yea, and slain the servants with
        the edge of the sword; and I only am escaped alone to tell
        thee.

001:018 While he was yet speaking, there came also another, and said,
        Thy sons and thy daughters were eating and drinking wine in
        their eldest brother's house:

001:019 And, behold, there came a great wind from the wilderness, and
        smote the four corners of the house, and it fell upon the
        young men, and they are dead; and I only am escaped alone to
        tell thee.

001:020 Then Job arose, and rent his mantle, and shaved his head, and
        fell down upon the ground, and worshipped,

001:021 And said, Naked came I out of my mother's womb, and naked
        shall I return thither: the LORD gave, and the LORD hath taken
        away; blessed be the name of the LORD.

001:022 In all this Job sinned not, nor charged God foolishly.

002:001 Again there was a day when the sons of God came to present
        themselves before the LORD, and Satan came also among them to
        present himself before the LORD.

002:002 And the LORD said unto Satan, From whence comest thou? And
        Satan answered the LORD, and said, From going to and fro in
        the earth, and from walking up and down in it.

002:003 And the LORD said unto Satan, Hast thou considered my servant
        Job, that there is none like him in the earth, a perfect and
        an upright man, one that feareth God, and escheweth evil? and
        still he holdeth fast his integrity, although thou movedst me
        against him, to destroy him without cause.

002:004 And Satan answered the LORD, and said, Skin for skin, yea, all
        that a man hath will he give for his life.

002:005 But put forth thine hand now, and touch his bone and his
        flesh, and he will curse thee to thy face.

002:006 And the LORD said unto Satan, Behold, he is in thine hand; but
        save his life.

002:007 So went Satan forth from the presence of the LORD, and smote
        Job with sore boils from the sole of his foot unto his crown.

002:008 And he took him a potsherd to scrape himself withal; and he
        sat down among the ashes.

002:009 Then said his wife unto him, Dost thou still retain thine
        integrity? curse God, and die.

002:010 But he said unto her, Thou speakest as one of the foolish
        women speaketh. What? shall we receive good at the hand of
        God, and shall we not receive evil? In all this did not Job
        sin with his lips.

002:011 Now when Job's three friends heard of all this evil that was
        come upon him, they came every one from his own place; Eliphaz
        the Temanite, and Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the
        Naamathite: for they had made an appointment together to come
        to mourn with him and to comfort him.

002:012 And when they lifted up their eyes afar off, and knew him not,
        they lifted up their voice, and wept; and they rent every one
        his mantle, and sprinkled dust upon their heads toward heaven.

002:013 So they sat down with him upon the ground seven days and seven
        nights, and none spake a word unto him: for they saw that his
        grief was very great.

003:001 After this opened Job his mouth, and cursed his day.

003:002 And Job spake, and said,

003:003 Let the day perish wherein I was born, and the night in which
        it was said, There is a man child conceived.

003:004 Let that day be darkness; let not God regard it from above,
        neither let the light shine upon it.

003:005 Let darkness and the shadow of death stain it; let a cloud
        dwell upon it; let the blackness of the day terrify it.

003:006 As for that night, let darkness seize upon it; let it not be
        joined unto the days of the year, let it not come into the
        number of the months.

003:007 Lo, let that night be solitary, let no joyful voice come
        therein.

003:008 Let them curse it that curse the day, who are ready to raise
        up their mourning.

003:009 Let the stars of the twilight thereof be dark; let it look for
        light, but have none; neither let it see the dawning of the
        day:

003:010 Because it shut not up the doors of my mother's womb, nor hid
        sorrow from mine eyes.

003:011 Why died I not from the womb? why did I not give up the ghost
        when I came out of the belly?

003:012 Why did the knees prevent me? or why the breasts that I should
        suck?

003:013 For now should I have lain still and been quiet, I should have
        slept: then had I been at rest,

003:014 With kings and counsellors of the earth, which build desolate
        places for themselves;

003:015 Or with princes that had gold, who filled their houses with
        silver:

003:016 Or as an hidden untimely birth I had not been; as infants
        which never saw light.

003:017 There the wicked cease from troubling; and there the weary be
        at rest.

003:018 There the prisoners rest together; they hear not the voice of
        the oppressor.

003:019 The small and great are there; and the servant is free from
        his master.

003:020 Wherefore is light given to him that is in misery, and life
        unto the bitter in soul;

003:021 Which long for death, but it cometh not; and dig for it more
        than for hid treasures;

003:022 Which rejoice exceedingly, and are glad, when they can find
        the grave?

003:023 Why is light given to a man whose way is hid, and whom God
        hath hedged in?

003:024 For my sighing cometh before I eat, and my roarings are poured
        out like the waters.

003:025 For the thing which I greatly feared is come upon me, and that
        which I was afraid of is come unto me.

003:026 I was not in safety, neither had I rest, neither was I quiet;
        yet trouble came.

004:001 Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said,

004:002 If we assay to commune with thee, wilt thou be grieved? but
        who can withhold himself from speaking?

004:003 Behold, thou hast instructed many, and thou hast strengthened
        the weak hands.

004:004 Thy words have upholden him that was falling, and thou hast
        strengthened the feeble knees.

004:005 But now it is come upon thee, and thou faintest; it toucheth
        thee, and thou art troubled.

004:006 Is not this thy fear, thy confidence, thy hope, and the
        uprightness of thy ways?

004:007 Remember, I pray thee, who ever perished, being innocent? or
        where were the righteous cut off?

004:008 Even as I have seen, they that plow iniquity, and sow
        wickedness, reap the same.

004:009 By the blast of God they perish, and by the breath of his
        nostrils are they consumed.

004:010 The roaring of the lion, and the voice of the fierce lion, and
        the teeth of the young lions, are broken.

004:011 The old lion perisheth for lack of prey, and the stout lion's
        whelps are scattered abroad.

004:012 Now a thing was secretly brought to me, and mine ear received
        a little thereof.

004:013 In thoughts from the visions of the night, when deep sleep
        falleth on men,

004:014 Fear came upon me, and trembling, which made all my bones to
        shake.

004:015 Then a spirit passed before my face; the hair of my flesh
        stood up:

004:016 It stood still, but I could not discern the form thereof: an
        image was before mine eyes, there was silence, and I heard a
        voice, saying,

004:017 Shall mortal man be more just than God? shall a man be more
        pure than his maker?

004:018 Behold, he put no trust in his servants; and his angels he
        charged with folly:

004:019 How much less in them that dwell in houses of clay, whose
        foundation is in the dust, which are crushed before the moth?

004:020 They are destroyed from morning to evening: they perish for
        ever without any regarding it.

004:021 Doth not their excellency which is in them go away? they die,
        even without wisdom.

005:001 Call now, if there be any that will answer thee; and to which
        of the saints wilt thou turn?

005:002 For wrath killeth the foolish man, and envy slayeth the silly
        one.

005:003 I have seen the foolish taking root: but suddenly I cursed his
        habitation.

005:004 His children are far from safety, and they are crushed in the
        gate, neither is there any to deliver them.

005:005 Whose harvest the hungry eateth up, and taketh it even out of
        the thorns, and the robber swalloweth up their substance.

005:006 Although affliction cometh not forth of the dust, neither doth
        trouble spring out of the ground;

005:007 Yet man is born unto trouble, as the sparks fly upward.

005:008 I would seek unto God, and unto God would I commit my cause:

005:009 Which doeth great things and unsearchable; marvellous things
        without number:

005:010 Who giveth rain upon the earth, and sendeth waters upon the
        fields:

005:011 To set up on high those that be low; that those which mourn
        may be exalted to safety.

005:012 He disappointeth the devices of the crafty, so that their
        hands cannot perform their enterprise.

005:013 He taketh the wise in their own craftiness: and the counsel of
        the froward is carried headlong.

005:014 They meet with darkness in the day time, and grope in the
        noonday as in the night.

005:015 But he saveth the poor from the sword, from their mouth, and
        from the hand of the mighty.

005:016 So the poor hath hope, and iniquity stoppeth her mouth.

005:017 Behold, happy is the man whom God correcteth: therefore
        despise not thou the chastening of the Almighty:

005:018 For he maketh sore, and bindeth up: he woundeth, and his hands
        make whole.

005:019 He shall deliver thee in six troubles: yea, in seven there
        shall no evil touch thee.

005:020 In famine he shall redeem thee from death: and in war from the
        power of the sword.

005:021 Thou shalt be hid from the scourge of the tongue: neither
        shalt thou be afraid of destruction when it cometh.

005:022 At destruction and famine thou shalt laugh: neither shalt thou
        be afraid of the beasts of the earth.

005:023 For thou shalt be in league with the stones of the field: and
        the beasts of the field shall be at peace with thee.

005:024 And thou shalt know that thy tabernacle shall be in peace; and
        thou shalt visit thy habitation, and shalt not sin.

005:025 Thou shalt know also that thy seed shall be great, and thine
        offspring as the grass of the earth.

005:026 Thou shalt come to thy grave in a full age, like as a shock of
        corn cometh in in his season.

005:027 Lo this, we have searched it, so it is; hear it, and know thou
        it for thy good.

006:001 But Job answered and said,

006:002 Oh that my grief were throughly weighed, and my calamity laid
        in the balances together!

006:003 For now it would be heavier than the sand of the sea:
        therefore my words are swallowed up.

006:004 For the arrows of the Almighty are within me, the poison
        whereof drinketh up my spirit: the terrors of God do set
        themselves in array against me.

006:005 Doth the wild ass bray when he hath grass? or loweth the ox
        over his fodder?

006:006 Can that which is unsavoury be eaten without salt? or is there
        any taste in the white of an egg?

006:007 The things that my soul refused to touch are as my sorrowful
        meat.

006:008 Oh that I might have my request; and that God would grant me
        the thing that I long for!

006:009 Even that it would please God to destroy me; that he would let
        loose his hand, and cut me off!

006:010 Then should I yet have comfort; yea, I would harden myself in
        sorrow: let him not spare; for I have not concealed the words
        of the Holy One.

006:011 What is my strength, that I should hope? and what is mine end,
        that I should prolong my life?

006:012 Is my strength the strength of stones? or is my flesh of
        brass?

006:013 Is not my help in me? and is wisdom driven quite from me?

006:014 To him that is afflicted pity should be shewed from his
        friend; but he forsaketh the fear of the Almighty.

006:015 My brethren have dealt deceitfully as a brook, and as the
        stream of brooks they pass away;

006:016 Which are blackish by reason of the ice, and wherein the snow
        is hid:

006:017 What time they wax warm, they vanish: when it is hot, they are
        consumed out of their place.

006:018 The paths of their way are turned aside; they go to nothing,
        and perish.

006:019 The troops of Tema looked, the companies of Sheba waited for
        them.

006:020 They were confounded because they had hoped; they came
        thither, and were ashamed.

006:021 For now ye are nothing; ye see my casting down, and are
        afraid.

006:022 Did I say, Bring unto me? or, Give a reward for me of your
        substance?

006:023 Or, Deliver me from the enemy's hand? or, Redeem me from the
        hand of the mighty?

006:024 Teach me, and I will hold my tongue: and cause me to
        understand wherein I have erred.

006:025 How forcible are right words! but what doth your arguing
        reprove?

006:026 Do ye imagine to reprove words, and the speeches of one that
        is desperate, which are as wind?

006:027 Yea, ye overwhelm the fatherless, and ye dig a pit for your
        friend.

006:028 Now therefore be content, look upon me; for it is evident unto
        you if I lie.

006:029 Return, I pray you, let it not be iniquity; yea, return again,
        my righteousness is in it.

006:030 Is there iniquity in my tongue? cannot my taste discern
        perverse things?

007:001 Is there not an appointed time to man upon earth? are not his
        days also like the days of an hireling?

007:002 As a servant earnestly desireth the shadow, and as an hireling
        looketh for the reward of his work:

007:003 So am I made to possess months of vanity, and wearisome nights
        are appointed to me.

007:004 When I lie down, I say, When shall I arise, and the night be
        gone? and I am full of tossings to and fro unto the dawning of
        the day.

007:005 My flesh is clothed with worms and clods of dust; my skin is
        broken, and become loathsome.

007:006 My days are swifter than a weaver's shuttle, and are spent
        without hope.

007:007 O remember that my life is wind: mine eye shall no more see
        good.

007:008 The eye of him that hath seen me shall see me no more: thine
        eyes are upon me, and I am not.

007:009 As the cloud is consumed and vanisheth away: so he that goeth
        down to the grave shall come up no more.

007:010 He shall return no more to his house, neither shall his place
        know him any more.

007:011 Therefore I will not refrain my mouth; I will speak in the
        anguish of my spirit; I will complain in the bitterness of my
        soul.

007:012 Am I a sea, or a whale, that thou settest a watch over me?

007:013 When I say, My bed shall comfort me, my couch shall ease my
        complaints;

007:014 Then thou scarest me with dreams, and terrifiest me through
        visions:

007:015 So that my soul chooseth strangling, and death rather than my
        life.

007:016 I loathe it; I would not live alway: let me alone; for my days
        are vanity.

007:017 What is man, that thou shouldest magnify him? and that thou
        shouldest set thine heart upon him?

007:018 And that thou shouldest visit him every morning, and try him
        every moment?

007:019 How long wilt thou not depart from me, nor let me alone till I
        swallow down my spittle?

007:020 I have sinned; what shall I do unto thee, O thou preserver of
        men? why hast thou set me as a mark against thee, so that I am
        a burden to myself?

007:021 And why dost thou not pardon my transgression, and take away
        my iniquity? for now shall I sleep in the dust; and thou shalt
        seek me in the morning, but I shall not be.

008:001 Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said,

008:002 How long wilt thou speak these things? and how long shall the
        words of thy mouth be like a strong wind?

008:003 Doth God pervert judgment? or doth the Almighty pervert
        justice?

008:004 If thy children have sinned against him, and he have cast them
        away for their transgression;

008:005 If thou wouldest seek unto God betimes, and make thy
        supplication to the Almighty;

008:006 If thou wert pure and upright; surely now he would awake for
        thee, and make the habitation of thy righteousness prosperous.

008:007 Though thy beginning was small, yet thy latter end should
        greatly increase.

008:008 For enquire, I pray thee, of the former age, and prepare
        thyself to the search of their fathers:

008:009 (For we are but of yesterday, and know nothing, because our
        days upon earth are a shadow:)

008:010 Shall not they teach thee, and tell thee, and utter words out
        of their heart?

008:011 Can the rush grow up without mire? can the flag grow without
        water?

008:012 Whilst it is yet in his greenness, and not cut down, it
        withereth before any other herb.

008:013 So are the paths of all that forget God; and the hypocrite's
        hope shall perish:

008:014 Whose hope shall be cut off, and whose trust shall be a
        spider's web.

008:015 He shall lean upon his house, but it shall not stand: he shall
        hold it fast, but it shall not endure.

008:016 He is green before the sun, and his branch shooteth forth in
        his garden.

008:017 His roots are wrapped about the heap, and seeth the place of
        stones.

008:018 If he destroy him from his place, then it shall deny him,
        saying, I have not seen thee.

008:019 Behold, this is the joy of his way, and out of the earth shall
        others grow.

008:020 Behold, God will not cast away a perfect man, neither will he
        help the evil doers:

008:021 Till he fill thy mouth with laughing, and thy lips with
        rejoicing.

008:022 They that hate thee shall be clothed with shame; and the
        dwelling place of the wicked shall come to nought.

009:001 Then Job answered and said,

009:002 I know it is so of a truth: but how should man be just with
        God?

009:003 If he will contend with him, he cannot answer him one of a
        thousand.

009:004 He is wise in heart, and mighty in strength: who hath hardened
        himself against him, and hath prospered?

009:005 Which removeth the mountains, and they know not: which
        overturneth them in his anger.

009:006 Which shaketh the earth out of her place, and the pillars
        thereof tremble.

009:007 Which commandeth the sun, and it riseth not; and sealeth up
        the stars.

009:008 Which alone spreadeth out the heavens, and treadeth upon the
        waves of the sea.

009:009 Which maketh Arcturus, Orion, and Pleiades, and the chambers
        of the south.

009:010 Which doeth great things past finding out; yea, and wonders
        without number.

009:011 Lo, he goeth by me, and I see him not: he passeth on also, but
        I perceive him not.

009:012 Behold, he taketh away, who can hinder him? who will say unto
        him, What doest thou?

009:013 If God will not withdraw his anger, the proud helpers do stoop
        under him.

009:014 How much less shall I answer him, and choose out my words to
        reason with him?

009:015 Whom, though I were righteous, yet would I not answer, but I
        would make supplication to my judge.

009:016 If I had called, and he had answered me; yet would I not
        believe that he had hearkened unto my voice.

009:017 For he breaketh me with a tempest, and multiplieth my wounds
        without cause.

009:018 He will not suffer me to take my breath, but filleth me with
        bitterness.

009:019 If I speak of strength, lo, he is strong: and if of judgment,
        who shall set me a time to plead?

009:020 If I justify myself, mine own mouth shall condemn me: if I
        say, I am perfect, it shall also prove me perverse.

009:021 Though I were perfect, yet would I not know my soul: I would
        despise my life.

009:022 This is one thing, therefore I said it, He destroyeth the
        perfect and the wicked.

009:023 If the scourge slay suddenly, he will laugh at the trial of
        the innocent.

009:024 The earth is given into the hand of the wicked: he covereth
        the faces of the judges thereof; if not, where, and who is he?

009:025 Now my days are swifter than a post: they flee away, they see
        no good.

009:026 They are passed away as the swift ships: as the eagle that
        hasteth to the prey.

009:027 If I say, I will forget my complaint, I will leave off my
        heaviness, and comfort myself:

009:028 I am afraid of all my sorrows, I know that thou wilt not hold
        me innocent.

009:029 If I be wicked, why then labour I in vain?

009:030 If I wash myself with snow water, and make my hands never so
        clean;

009:031 Yet shalt thou plunge me in the ditch, and mine own clothes
        shall abhor me.

009:032 For he is not a man, as I am, that I should answer him, and we
        should come together in judgment.

009:033 Neither is there any daysman betwixt us, that might lay his
        hand upon us both.

009:034 Let him take his rod away from me, and let not his fear
        terrify me:

009:035 Then would I speak, and not fear him; but it is not so with
        me.

010:001 My soul is weary of my life; I will leave my complaint upon
        myself; I will speak in the bitterness of my soul.

010:002 I will say unto God, Do not condemn me; shew me wherefore thou
        contendest with me.

010:003 Is it good unto thee that thou shouldest oppress, that thou
        shouldest despise the work of thine hands, and shine upon the
        counsel of the wicked?

010:004 Hast thou eyes of flesh? or seest thou as man seeth?

010:005 Are thy days as the days of man? are thy years as man's days,

010:006 That thou enquirest after mine iniquity, and searchest after
        my sin?

010:007 Thou knowest that I am not wicked; and there is none that can
        deliver out of thine hand.

010:008 Thine hands have made me and fashioned me together round
        about; yet thou dost destroy me.

010:009 Remember, I beseech thee, that thou hast made me as the clay;
        and wilt thou bring me into dust again?

010:010 Hast thou not poured me out as milk, and curdled me like
        cheese?

010:011 Thou hast clothed me with skin and flesh, and hast fenced me
        with bones and sinews.

010:012 Thou hast granted me life and favour, and thy visitation hath
        preserved my spirit.

010:013 And these things hast thou hid in thine heart: I know that
        this is with thee.

010:014 If I sin, then thou markest me, and thou wilt not acquit me
        from mine iniquity.

010:015 If I be wicked, woe unto me; and if I be righteous, yet will I
        not lift up my head. I am full of confusion; therefore see
        thou mine affliction;

010:016 For it increaseth. Thou huntest me as a fierce lion: and again
        thou shewest thyself marvellous upon me.

010:017 Thou renewest thy witnesses against me, and increasest thine
        indignation upon me; changes and war are against me.

010:018 Wherefore then hast thou brought me forth out of the womb? Oh
        that I had given up the ghost, and no eye had seen me!

010:019 I should have been as though I had not been; I should have
        been carried from the womb to the grave.

010:020 Are not my days few? cease then, and let me alone, that I may
        take comfort a little,

010:021 Before I go whence I shall not return, even to the land of
        darkness and the shadow of death;

010:022 A land of darkness, as darkness itself; and of the shadow of
        death, without any order, and where the light is as darkness.

011:001 Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said,

011:002 Should not the multitude of words be answered? and should a
        man full of talk be justified?

011:003 Should thy lies make men hold their peace? and when thou
        mockest, shall no man make thee ashamed?

011:004 For thou hast said, My doctrine is pure, and I am clean in
        thine eyes.

011:005 But oh that God would speak, and open his lips against thee;

011:006 And that he would shew thee the secrets of wisdom, that they
        are double to that which is! Know therefore that God exacteth
        of thee less than thine iniquity deserveth.

011:007 Canst thou by searching find out God? canst thou find out the
        Almighty unto perfection?

011:008 It is as high as heaven; what canst thou do? deeper than hell;
        what canst thou know?

011:009 The measure thereof is longer than the earth, and broader than
        the sea.

011:010 If he cut off, and shut up, or gather together, then who can
        hinder him?

011:011 For he knoweth vain men: he seeth wickedness also; will he not
        then consider it?

011:012 For vain men would be wise, though man be born like a wild
        ass's colt.

011:013 If thou prepare thine heart, and stretch out thine hands
        toward him;

011:014 If iniquity be in thine hand, put it far away, and let not
        wickedness dwell in thy tabernacles.

011:015 For then shalt thou lift up thy face without spot; yea, thou
        shalt be stedfast, and shalt not fear:

011:016 Because thou shalt forget thy misery, and remember it as
        waters that pass away:

011:017 And thine age shall be clearer than the noonday: thou shalt
        shine forth, thou shalt be as the morning.

011:018 And thou shalt be secure, because there is hope; yea, thou
        shalt dig about thee, and thou shalt take thy rest in safety.

011:019 Also thou shalt lie down, and none shall make thee afraid;
        yea, many shall make suit unto thee.

011:020 But the eyes of the wicked shall fail, and they shall not
        escape, and their hope shall be as the giving up of the ghost.

012:001 And Job answered and said,

012:002 No doubt but ye are the people, and wisdom shall die with you.

012:003 But I have understanding as well as you; I am not inferior to
        you: yea, who knoweth not such things as these?

012:004 I am as one mocked of his neighbour, who calleth upon God, and
        he answereth him: the just upright man is laughed to scorn.

012:005 He that is ready to slip with his feet is as a lamp despised
        in the thought of him that is at ease.

012:006 The tabernacles of robbers prosper, and they that provoke God
        are secure; into whose hand God bringeth abundantly.

012:007 But ask now the beasts, and they shall teach thee; and the
        fowls of the air, and they shall tell thee:

012:008 Or speak to the earth, and it shall teach thee: and the fishes
        of the sea shall declare unto thee.

012:009 Who knoweth not in all these that the hand of the LORD hath
        wrought this?

012:010 In whose hand is the soul of every living thing, and the
        breath of all mankind.

012:011 Doth not the ear try words? and the mouth taste his meat?

012:012 With the ancient is wisdom; and in length of days
        understanding.

012:013 With him is wisdom and strength, he hath counsel and
        understanding.

012:014 Behold, he breaketh down, and it cannot be built again: he
        shutteth up a man, and there can be no opening.

012:015 Behold, he withholdeth the waters, and they dry up: also he
        sendeth them out, and they overturn the earth.

012:016 With him is strength and wisdom: the deceived and the deceiver
        are his.

012:017 He leadeth counsellors away spoiled, and maketh the judges
        fools.

012:018 He looseth the bond of kings, and girdeth their loins with a
        girdle.

012:019 He leadeth princes away spoiled, and overthroweth the mighty.

012:020 He removeth away the speech of the trusty, and taketh away the
        understanding of the aged.

012:021 He poureth contempt upon princes, and weakeneth the strength
        of the mighty.

012:022 He discovereth deep things out of darkness, and bringeth out
        to light the shadow of death.

012:023 He increaseth the nations, and destroyeth them: he enlargeth
        the nations, and straiteneth them again.

012:024 He taketh away the heart of the chief of the people of the
        earth, and causeth them to wander in a wilderness where there
        is no way.

012:025 They grope in the dark without light, and he maketh them to
        stagger like a drunken man.

013:001 Lo, mine eye hath seen all this, mine ear hath heard and
        understood it.

013:002 What ye know, the same do I know also: I am not inferior unto
        you.

013:003 Surely I would speak to the Almighty, and I desire to reason
        with God.

013:004 But ye are forgers of lies, ye are all physicians of no value.

013:005 O that ye would altogether hold your peace! and it should be
        your wisdom.

013:006 Hear now my reasoning, and hearken to the pleadings of my
        lips.

013:007 Will ye speak wickedly for God? and talk deceitfully for him?

013:008 Will ye accept his person? will ye contend for God?

013:009 Is it good that he should search you out? or as one man
        mocketh another, do ye so mock him?

013:010 He will surely reprove you, if ye do secretly accept persons.

013:011 Shall not his excellency make you afraid? and his dread fall
        upon you?

013:012 Your remembrances are like unto ashes, your bodies to bodies
        of clay.

013:013 Hold your peace, let me alone, that I may speak, and let come
        on me what will.

013:014 Wherefore do I take my flesh in my teeth, and put my life in
        mine hand?

013:015 Though he slay me, yet will I trust in him: but I will
        maintain mine own ways before him.

013:016 He also shall be my salvation: for an hypocrite shall not come
        before him.

013:017 Hear diligently my speech, and my declaration with your ears.

013:018 Behold now, I have ordered my cause; I know that I shall be
        justified.

013:019 Who is he that will plead with me? for now, if I hold my
        tongue, I shall give up the ghost.

013:020 Only do not two things unto me: then will I not hide myself
        from thee.

013:021 Withdraw thine hand far from me: and let not thy dread make me
        afraid.

013:022 Then call thou, and I will answer: or let me speak, and answer
        thou me.

013:023 How many are mine iniquities and sins? make me to know my
        transgression and my sin.

013:024 Wherefore hidest thou thy face, and holdest me for thine
        enemy?

013:025 Wilt thou break a leaf driven to and fro? and wilt thou pursue
        the dry stubble?

013:026 For thou writest bitter things against me, and makest me to
        possess the iniquities of my youth.

013:027 Thou puttest my feet also in the stocks, and lookest narrowly
        unto all my paths; thou settest a print upon the heels of my
        feet.

013:028 And he, as a rotten thing, consumeth, as a garment that is
        moth eaten.

014:001 Man that is born of a woman is of few days and full of
        trouble.

014:002 He cometh forth like a flower, and is cut down: he fleeth also
        as a shadow, and continueth not.

014:003 And doth thou open thine eyes upon such an one, and bringest
        me into judgment with thee?

014:004 Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? not one.

014:005 Seeing his days are determined, the number of his months are
        with thee, thou hast appointed his bounds that he cannot pass;

014:006 Turn from him, that he may rest, till he shall accomplish, as
        an hireling, his day.

014:007 For there is hope of a tree, if it be cut down, that it will
        sprout again, and that the tender branch thereof will not
        cease.

014:008 Though the root thereof wax old in the earth, and the stock
        thereof die in the ground;

014:009 Yet through the scent of water it will bud, and bring forth
        boughs like a plant.

014:010 But man dieth, and wasteth away: yea, man giveth up the ghost,
        and where is he?

014:011 As the waters fail from the sea, and the flood decayeth and
        drieth up:

014:012 So man lieth down, and riseth not: till the heavens be no
        more, they shall not awake, nor be raised out of their sleep.

014:013 O that thou wouldest hide me in the grave, that thou wouldest
        keep me secret, until thy wrath be past, that thou wouldest
        appoint me a set time, and remember me!

014:014 If a man die, shall he live again? all the days of my
        appointed time will I wait, till my change come.

014:015 Thou shalt call, and I will answer thee: thou wilt have a
        desire to the work of thine hands.

014:016 For now thou numberest my steps: dost thou not watch over my
        sin?

014:017 My transgression is sealed up in a bag, and thou sewest up
        mine iniquity.

014:018 And surely the mountains falling cometh to nought, and the
        rock is removed out of his place.

014:019 The waters wear the stones: thou washest away the things which
        grow out of the dust of the earth; and thou destroyest the
        hope of man.

014:020 Thou prevailest for ever against him, and he passeth: thou
        changest his countenance, and sendest him away.

014:021 His sons come to honour, and he knoweth it not; and they are
        brought low, but he perceiveth it not of them.

014:022 But his flesh upon him shall have pain, and his soul within
        him shall mourn.

015:001 Then answered Eliphaz the Temanite, and said,

015:002 Should a wise man utter vain knowledge, and fill his belly
        with the east wind?

015:003 Should he reason with unprofitable talk? or with speeches
        wherewith he can do no good?

015:004 Yea, thou castest off fear, and restrainest prayer before God.

015:005 For thy mouth uttereth thine iniquity, and thou choosest the
        tongue of the crafty.

015:006 Thine own mouth condemneth thee, and not I: yea, thine own
        lips testify against thee.

015:007 Art thou the first man that was born? or wast thou made before
        the hills?

015:008 Hast thou heard the secret of God? and dost thou restrain
        wisdom to thyself?

015:009 What knowest thou, that we know not? what understandest thou,
        which is not in us?

015:010 With us are both the grayheaded and very aged men, much elder
        than thy father.

015:011 Are the consolations of God small with thee? is there any
        secret thing with thee?

015:012 Why doth thine heart carry thee away? and what do thy eyes
        wink at,

015:013 That thou turnest thy spirit against God, and lettest such
        words go out of thy mouth?

015:014 What is man, that he should be clean? and he which is born of
        a woman, that he should be righteous?

015:015 Behold, he putteth no trust in his saints; yea, the heavens
        are not clean in his sight.

015:016 How much more abominable and filthy is man, which drinketh
        iniquity like water?

015:017 I will shew thee, hear me; and that which I have seen I will
        declare;

015:018 Which wise men have told from their fathers, and have not hid
        it:

015:019 Unto whom alone the earth was given, and no stranger passed
        among them.

015:020 The wicked man travaileth with pain all his days, and the
        number of years is hidden to the oppressor.

015:021 A dreadful sound is in his ears: in prosperity the destroyer
        shall come upon him.

015:022 He believeth not that he shall return out of darkness, and he
        is waited for of the sword.

015:023 He wandereth abroad for bread, saying, Where is it? he knoweth
        that the day of darkness is ready at his hand.

015:024 Trouble and anguish shall make him afraid; they shall prevail
        against him, as a king ready to the battle.

015:025 For he stretcheth out his hand against God, and strengtheneth
        himself against the Almighty.

015:026 He runneth upon him, even on his neck, upon the thick bosses
        of his bucklers:

015:027 Because he covereth his face with his fatness, and maketh
        collops of fat on his flanks.

015:028 And he dwelleth in desolate cities, and in houses which no man
        inhabiteth, which are ready to become heaps.

015:029 He shall not be rich, neither shall his substance continue,
        neither shall he prolong the perfection thereof upon the
        earth.

015:030 He shall not depart out of darkness; the flame shall dry up
        his branches, and by the breath of his mouth shall he go away.

015:031 Let not him that is deceived trust in vanity: for vanity shall
        be his recompence.

015:032 It shall be accomplished before his time, and his branch shall
        not be green.

015:033 He shall shake off his unripe grape as the vine, and shall
        cast off his flower as the olive.

015:034 For the congregation of hypocrites shall be desolate, and fire
        shall consume the tabernacles of bribery.

015:035 They conceive mischief, and bring forth vanity, and their
        belly prepareth deceit.

016:001 Then Job answered and said,

016:002 I have heard many such things: miserable comforters are ye
        all.

016:003 Shall vain words have an end? or what emboldeneth thee that
        thou answerest?

016:004 I also could speak as ye do: if your soul were in my soul's
        stead, I could heap up words against you, and shake mine head
        at you.

016:005 But I would strengthen you with my mouth, and the moving of my
        lips should asswage your grief.

016:006 Though I speak, my grief is not asswaged: and though I
        forbear, what am I eased?

016:007 But now he hath made me weary: thou hast made desolate all my
        company.

016:008 And thou hast filled me with wrinkles, which is a witness
        against me: and my leanness rising up in me beareth witness to
        my face.

016:009 He teareth me in his wrath, who hateth me: he gnasheth upon me
        with his teeth; mine enemy sharpeneth his eyes upon me.

016:010 They have gaped upon me with their mouth; they have smitten me
        upon the cheek reproachfully; they have gathered themselves
        together against me.

016:011 God hath delivered me to the ungodly, and turned me over into
        the hands of the wicked.

016:012 I was at ease, but he hath broken me asunder: he hath also
        taken me by my neck, and shaken me to pieces, and set me up
        for his mark.

016:013 His archers compass me round about, he cleaveth my reins
        asunder, and doth not spare; he poureth out my gall upon the
        ground.

016:014 He breaketh me with breach upon breach, he runneth upon me
        like a giant.

016:015 I have sewed sackcloth upon my skin, and defiled my horn in
        the dust.

016:016 My face is foul with weeping, and on my eyelids is the shadow
        of death;

016:017 Not for any injustice in mine hands: also my prayer is pure.

016:018 O earth, cover not thou my blood, and let my cry have no
        place.

016:019 Also now, behold, my witness is in heaven, and my record is on
        high.

016:020 My friends scorn me: but mine eye poureth out tears unto God.

016:021 O that one might plead for a man with God, as a man pleadeth
        for his neighbour!

016:022 When a few years are come, then I shall go the way whence I
        shall not return.

017:001 My breath is corrupt, my days are extinct, the graves are
        ready for me.

017:002 Are there not mockers with me? and doth not mine eye continue
        in their provocation?

017:003 Lay down now, put me in a surety with thee; who is he that
        will strike hands with me?

017:004 For thou hast hid their heart from understanding: therefore
        shalt thou not exalt them.

017:005 He that speaketh flattery to his friends, even the eyes of his
        children shall fail.

017:006 He hath made me also a byword of the people; and aforetime I
        was as a tabret.

017:007 Mine eye also is dim by reason of sorrow, and all my members
        are as a shadow.

017:008 Upright men shall be astonied at this, and the innocent shall
        stir up himself against the hypocrite.

017:009 The righteous also shall hold on his way, and he that hath
        clean hands shall be stronger and stronger.

017:010 But as for you all, do ye return, and come now: for I cannot
        find one wise man among you.

017:011 My days are past, my purposes are broken off, even the
        thoughts of my heart.

017:012 They change the night into day: the light is short because of
        darkness.

017:013 If I wait, the grave is mine house: I have made my bed in the
        darkness.

017:014 I have said to corruption, Thou art my father: to the worm,
        Thou art my mother, and my sister.

017:015 And where is now my hope? as for my hope, who shall see it?

017:016 They shall go down to the bars of the pit, when our rest
        together is in the dust.

018:001 Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said,

018:002 How long will it be ere ye make an end of words? mark, and
        afterwards we will speak.

018:003 Wherefore are we counted as beasts, and reputed vile in your
        sight?

018:004 He teareth himself in his anger: shall the earth be forsaken
        for thee? and shall the rock be removed out of his place?

018:005 Yea, the light of the wicked shall be put out, and the spark
        of his fire shall not shine.

018:006 The light shall be dark in his tabernacle, and his candle
        shall be put out with him.

018:007 The steps of his strength shall be straitened, and his own
        counsel shall cast him down.

018:008 For he is cast into a net by his own feet, and he walketh upon
        a snare.

018:009 The gin shall take him by the heel, and the robber shall
        prevail against him.

018:010 The snare is laid for him in the ground, and a trap for him in
        the way.

018:011 Terrors shall make him afraid on every side, and shall drive
        him to his feet.

018:012 His strength shall be hungerbitten, and destruction shall be
        ready at his side.

018:013 It shall devour the strength of his skin: even the firstborn
        of death shall devour his strength.

018:014 His confidence shall be rooted out of his tabernacle, and it
        shall bring him to the king of terrors.

018:015 It shall dwell in his tabernacle, because it is none of his:
        brimstone shall be scattered upon his habitation.

018:016 His roots shall be dried up beneath, and above shall his
        branch be cut off.

018:017 His remembrance shall perish from the earth, and he shall have
        no name in the street.

018:018 He shall be driven from light into darkness, and chased out of
        the world.

018:019 He shall neither have son nor nephew among his people, nor any
        remaining in his dwellings.

018:020 They that come after him shall be astonied at his day, as they
        that went before were affrighted.

018:021 Surely such are the dwellings of the wicked, and this is the
        place of him that knoweth not God.

019:001 Then Job answered and said,

019:002 How long will ye vex my soul, and break me in pieces with
        words?

019:003 These ten times have ye reproached me: ye are not ashamed that
        ye make yourselves strange to me.

019:004 And be it indeed that I have erred, mine error remaineth with
        myself.

019:005 If indeed ye will magnify yourselves against me, and plead
        against me my reproach:

019:006 Know now that God hath overthrown me, and hath compassed me
        with his net.

019:007 Behold, I cry out of wrong, but I am not heard: I cry aloud,
        but there is no judgment.

019:008 He hath fenced up my way that I cannot pass, and he hath set
        darkness in my paths.

019:009 He hath stripped me of my glory, and taken the crown from my
        head.

019:010 He hath destroyed me on every side, and I am gone: and mine
        hope hath he removed like a tree.

019:011 He hath also kindled his wrath against me, and he counteth me
        unto him as one of his enemies.

019:012 His troops come together, and raise up their way against me,
        and encamp round about my tabernacle.

019:013 He hath put my brethren far from me, and mine acquaintance are
        verily estranged from me.

019:014 My kinsfolk have failed, and my familiar friends have
        forgotten me.

019:015 They that dwell in mine house, and my maids, count me for a
        stranger: I am an alien in their sight.

019:016 I called my servant, and he gave me no answer; I intreated him
        with my mouth.

019:017 My breath is strange to my wife, though I intreated for the
        children's sake of mine own body.

019:018 Yea, young children despised me; I arose, and they spake
        against me.

019:019 All my inward friends abhorred me: and they whom I loved are
        turned against me.

019:020 My bone cleaveth to my skin and to my flesh, and I am escaped
        with the skin of my teeth.

019:021 Have pity upon me, have pity upon me, O ye my friends; for the
        hand of God hath touched me.

019:022 Why do ye persecute me as God, and are not satisfied with my
        flesh?

019:023 Oh that my words were now written! oh that they were printed
        in a book!

019:024 That they were graven with an iron pen and lead in the rock
        for ever!

019:025 For I know that my redeemer liveth, and that he shall stand at
        the latter day upon the earth:

019:026 And though after my skin worms destroy this body, yet in my
        flesh shall I see God:

019:027 Whom I shall see for myself, and mine eyes shall behold, and
        not another; though my reins be consumed within me.

019:028 But ye should say, Why persecute we him, seeing the root of
        the matter is found in me?

019:029 Be ye afraid of the sword: for wrath bringeth the punishments
        of the sword, that ye may know there is a judgment.

020:001 Then answered Zophar the Naamathite, and said,

020:002 Therefore do my thoughts cause me to answer, and for this I
        make haste.

020:003 I have heard the check of my reproach, and the spirit of my
        understanding causeth me to answer.

020:004 Knowest thou not this of old, since man was placed upon earth,

020:005 That the triumphing of the wicked is short, and the joy of the
        hypocrite but for a moment?

020:006 Though his excellency mount up to the heavens, and his head
        reach unto the clouds;

020:007 Yet he shall perish for ever like his own dung: they which
        have seen him shall say, Where is he?

020:008 He shall fly away as a dream, and shall not be found: yea, he
        shall be chased away as a vision of the night.

020:009 The eye also which saw him shall see him no more; neither
        shall his place any more behold him.

020:010 His children shall seek to please the poor, and his hands
        shall restore their goods.

020:011 His bones are full of the sin of his youth, which shall lie
        down with him in the dust.

020:012 Though wickedness be sweet in his mouth, though he hide it
        under his tongue;

020:013 Though he spare it, and forsake it not; but keep it still
        within his mouth:

020:014 Yet his meat in his bowels is turned, it is the gall of asps
        within him.

020:015 He hath swallowed down riches, and he shall vomit them up
        again: God shall cast them out of his belly.

020:016 He shall suck the poison of asps: the viper's tongue shall
        slay him.

020:017 He shall not see the rivers, the floods, the brooks of honey
        and butter.

020:018 That which he laboured for shall he restore, and shall not
        swallow it down: according to his substance shall the
        restitution be, and he shall not rejoice therein.

020:019 Because he hath oppressed and hath forsaken the poor; because
        he hath violently taken away an house which he builded not;

020:020 Surely he shall not feel quietness in his belly, he shall not
        save of that which he desired.

020:021 There shall none of his meat be left; therefore shall no man
        look for his goods.

020:022 In the fulness of his sufficiency he shall be in straits:
        every hand of the wicked shall come upon him.

020:023 When he is about to fill his belly, God shall cast the fury of
        his wrath upon him, and shall rain it upon him while he is
        eating.

020:024 He shall flee from the iron weapon, and the bow of steel shall
        strike him through.

020:025 It is drawn, and cometh out of the body; yea, the glittering
        sword cometh out of his gall: terrors are upon him.

020:026 All darkness shall be hid in his secret places: a fire not
        blown shall consume him; it shall go ill with him that is left
        in his tabernacle.

020:027 The heaven shall reveal his iniquity; and the earth shall rise
        up against him.

020:028 The increase of his house shall depart, and his goods shall
        flow away in the day of his wrath.

020:029 This is the portion of a wicked man from God, and the heritage
        appointed unto him by God.

021:001 But Job answered and said,

021:002 Hear diligently my speech, and let this be your consolations.

021:003 Suffer me that I may speak; and after that I have spoken, mock
        on.

021:004 As for me, is my complaint to man? and if it were so, why
        should not my spirit be troubled?

021:005 Mark me, and be astonished, and lay your hand upon your mouth.

021:006 Even when I remember I am afraid, and trembling taketh hold on
        my flesh.

021:007 Wherefore do the wicked live, become old, yea, are mighty in
        power?

021:008 Their seed is established in their sight with them, and their
        offspring before their eyes.

021:009 Their houses are safe from fear, neither is the rod of God
        upon them.

021:010 Their bull gendereth, and faileth not; their cow calveth, and
        casteth not her calf.

021:011 They send forth their little ones like a flock, and their
        children dance.

021:012 They take the timbrel and harp, and rejoice at the sound of
        the organ.

021:013 They spend their days in wealth, and in a moment go down to
        the grave.

021:014 Therefore they say unto God, Depart from us; for we desire not
        the knowledge of thy ways.

021:015 What is the Almighty, that we should serve him? and what
        profit should we have, if we pray unto him?

021:016 Lo, their good is not in their hand: the counsel of the wicked
        is far from me.

021:017 How oft is the candle of the wicked put out! and how oft
        cometh their destruction upon them! God distributeth sorrows
        in his anger.

021:018 They are as stubble before the wind, and as chaff that the
        storm carrieth away.

021:019 God layeth up his iniquity for his children: he rewardeth him,
        and he shall know it.

021:020 His eyes shall see his destruction, and he shall drink of the
        wrath of the Almighty.

021:021 For what pleasure hath he in his house after him, when the
        number of his months is cut off in the midst?

021:022 Shall any teach God knowledge? seeing he judgeth those that
        are high.

021:023 One dieth in his full strength, being wholly at ease and
        quiet.

021:024 His breasts are full of milk, and his bones are moistened with
        marrow.

021:025 And another dieth in the bitterness of his soul, and never
        eateth with pleasure.

021:026 They shall lie down alike in the dust, and the worms shall
        cover them.

021:027 Behold, I know your thoughts, and the devices which ye
        wrongfully imagine against me.

021:028 For ye say, Where is the house of the prince? and where are
        the dwelling places of the wicked?

021:029 Have ye not asked them that go by the way? and do ye not know
        their tokens,

021:030 That the wicked is reserved to the day of destruction? they
        shall be brought forth to the day of wrath.

021:031 Who shall declare his way to his face? and who shall repay him
        what he hath done?

021:032 Yet shall he be brought to the grave, and shall remain in the
        tomb.

021:033 The clods of the valley shall be sweet unto him, and every man
        shall draw after him, as there are innumerable before him.

021:034 How then comfort ye me in vain, seeing in your answers there
        remaineth falsehood?

022:001 Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said,

022:002 Can a man be profitable unto God, as he that is wise may be
        profitable unto himself?

022:003 Is it any pleasure to the Almighty, that thou art righteous?
        or is it gain to him, that thou makest thy ways perfect?

022:004 Will he reprove thee for fear of thee? will he enter with thee
        into judgment?

022:005 Is not thy wickedness great? and thine iniquities infinite?

022:006 For thou hast taken a pledge from thy brother for nought, and
        stripped the naked of their clothing.

022:007 Thou hast not given water to the weary to drink, and thou hast
        withholden bread from the hungry.

022:008 But as for the mighty man, he had the earth; and the
        honourable man dwelt in it.

022:009 Thou hast sent widows away empty, and the arms of the
        fatherless have been broken.

022:010 Therefore snares are round about thee, and sudden fear
        troubleth thee;

022:011 Or darkness, that thou canst not see; and abundance of waters
        cover thee.

022:012 Is not God in the height of heaven? and behold the height of
        the stars, how high they are!

022:013 And thou sayest, How doth God know? can he judge through the
        dark cloud?

022:014 Thick clouds are a covering to him, that he seeth not; and he
        walketh in the circuit of heaven.

022:015 Hast thou marked the old way which wicked men have trodden?

022:016 Which were cut down out of time, whose foundation was
        overflown with a flood:

022:017 Which said unto God, Depart from us: and what can the Almighty
        do for them?

022:018 Yet he filled their houses with good things: but the counsel
        of the wicked is far from me.

022:019 The righteous see it, and are glad: and the innocent laugh
        them to scorn.

022:020 Whereas our substance is not cut down, but the remnant of them
        the fire consumeth.

022:021 Acquaint now thyself with him, and be at peace: thereby good
        shall come unto thee.

022:022 Receive, I pray thee, the law from his mouth, and lay up his
        words in thine heart.

022:023 If thou return to the Almighty, thou shalt be built up, thou
        shalt put away iniquity far from thy tabernacles.

022:024 Then shalt thou lay up gold as dust, and the gold of Ophir as
        the stones of the brooks.

022:025 Yea, the Almighty shall be thy defence, and thou shalt have
        plenty of silver.

022:026 For then shalt thou have thy delight in the Almighty, and
        shalt lift up thy face unto God.

022:027 Thou shalt make thy prayer unto him, and he shall hear thee,
        and thou shalt pay thy vows.

022:028 Thou shalt also decree a thing, and it shall be established
        unto thee: and the light shall shine upon thy ways.

022:029 When men are cast down, then thou shalt say, There is lifting
        up; and he shall save the humble person.

022:030 He shall deliver the island of the innocent: and it is
        delivered by the pureness of thine hands.

023:001 Then Job answered and said,

023:002 Even to day is my complaint bitter: my stroke is heavier than
        my groaning.

023:003 Oh that I knew where I might find him! that I might come even
        to his seat!

023:004 I would order my cause before him, and fill my mouth with
        arguments.

023:005 I would know the words which he would answer me, and
        understand what he would say unto me.

023:006 Will he plead against me with his great power? No; but he
        would put strength in me.

023:007 There the righteous might dispute with him; so should I be
        delivered for ever from my judge.

023:008 Behold, I go forward, but he is not there; and backward, but I
        cannot perceive him:

023:009 On the left hand, where he doth work, but I cannot behold him:
        he hideth himself on the right hand, that I cannot see him:

023:010 But he knoweth the way that I take: when he hath tried me, I
        shall come forth as gold.

023:011 My foot hath held his steps, his way have I kept, and not
        declined.

023:012 Neither have I gone back from the commandment of his lips; I
        have esteemed the words of his mouth more than my necessary
        food.

023:013 But he is in one mind, and who can turn him? and what his soul
        desireth, even that he doeth.

023:014 For he performeth the thing that is appointed for me: and many
        such things are with him.

023:015 Therefore am I troubled at his presence: when I consider, I am
        afraid of him.

023:016 For God maketh my heart soft, and the Almighty troubleth me:

023:017 Because I was not cut off before the darkness, neither hath he
        covered the darkness from my face.

024:001 Why, seeing times are not hidden from the Almighty, do they
        that know him not see his days?

024:002 Some remove the landmarks; they violently take away flocks,
        and feed thereof.

024:003 They drive away the ass of the fatherless, they take the
        widow's ox for a pledge.

024:004 They turn the needy out of the way: the poor of the earth hide
        themselves together.

024:005 Behold, as wild asses in the desert, go they forth to their
        work; rising betimes for a prey: the wilderness yieldeth food
        for them and for their children.

024:006 They reap every one his corn in the field: and they gather the
        vintage of the wicked.

024:007 They cause the naked to lodge without clothing, that they have
        no covering in the cold.

024:008 They are wet with the showers of the mountains, and embrace
        the rock for want of a shelter.

024:009 They pluck the fatherless from the breast, and take a pledge
        of the poor.

024:010 They cause him to go naked without clothing, and they take
        away the sheaf from the hungry;

024:011 Which make oil within their walls, and tread their
        winepresses, and suffer thirst.

024:012 Men groan from out of the city, and the soul of the wounded
        crieth out: yet God layeth not folly to them.

024:013 They are of those that rebel against the light; they know not
        the ways thereof, nor abide in the paths thereof.

024:014 The murderer rising with the light killeth the poor and needy,
        and in the night is as a thief.

024:015 The eye also of the adulterer waiteth for the twilight,
        saying, No eye shall see me: and disguiseth his face.

024:016 In the dark they dig through houses, which they had marked for
        themselves in the daytime: they know not the light.

024:017 For the morning is to them even as the shadow of death: if one
        know them, they are in the terrors of the shadow of death.

024:018 He is swift as the waters; their portion is cursed in the
        earth: he beholdeth not the way of the vineyards.

024:019 Drought and heat consume the snow waters: so doth the grave
        those which have sinned.

024:020 The womb shall forget him; the worm shall feed sweetly on him;
        he shall be no more remembered; and wickedness shall be broken
        as a tree.

024:021 He evil entreateth the barren that beareth not: and doeth not
        good to the widow.

024:022 He draweth also the mighty with his power: he riseth up, and
        no man is sure of life.

024:023 Though it be given him to be in safety, whereon he resteth;
        yet his eyes are upon their ways.

024:024 They are exalted for a little while, but are gone and brought
        low; they are taken out of the way as all other, and cut off
        as the tops of the ears of corn.

024:025 And if it be not so now, who will make me a liar, and make my
        speech nothing worth?

025:001 Then answered Bildad the Shuhite, and said,

025:002 Dominion and fear are with him, he maketh peace in his high
        places.

025:003 Is there any number of his armies? and upon whom doth not his
        light arise?

025:004 How then can man be justified with God? or how can he be clean
        that is born of a woman?

025:005 Behold even to the moon, and it shineth not; yea, the stars
        are not pure in his sight.

025:006 How much less man, that is a worm? and the son of man, which
        is a worm?

026:001 But Job answered and said,

026:002 How hast thou helped him that is without power? how savest
        thou the arm that hath no strength?

026:003 How hast thou counselled him that hath no wisdom? and how hast
        thou plentifully declared the thing as it is?

026:004 To whom hast thou uttered words? and whose spirit came from
        thee?

026:005 Dead things are formed from under the waters, and the
        inhabitants thereof.

026:006 Hell is naked before him, and destruction hath no covering.

026:007 He stretcheth out the north over the empty place, and hangeth
        the earth upon nothing.

026:008 He bindeth up the waters in his thick clouds; and the cloud is
        not rent under them.

026:009 He holdeth back the face of his throne, and spreadeth his
        cloud upon it.

026:010 He hath compassed the waters with bounds, until the day and
        night come to an end.

026:011 The pillars of heaven tremble and are astonished at his
        reproof.

026:012 He divideth the sea with his power, and by his understanding
        he smiteth through the proud.

026:013 By his spirit he hath garnished the heavens; his hand hath
        formed the crooked serpent.

026:014 Lo, these are parts of his ways: but how little a portion is
        heard of him? but the thunder of his power who can understand?

027:001 Moreover Job continued his parable, and said,

027:002 As God liveth, who hath taken away my judgment; and the
        Almighty, who hath vexed my soul;

027:003 All the while my breath is in me, and the spirit of God is in
        my nostrils;

027:004 My lips shall not speak wickedness, nor my tongue utter
        deceit.

027:005 God forbid that I should justify you: till I die I will not
        remove mine integrity from me.

027:006 My righteousness I hold fast, and will not let it go: my heart
        shall not reproach me so long as I live.

027:007 Let mine enemy be as the wicked, and he that riseth up against
        me as the unrighteous.

027:008 For what is the hope of the hypocrite, though he hath gained,
        when God taketh away his soul?

027:009 Will God hear his cry when trouble cometh upon him?

027:010 Will he delight himself in the Almighty? will he always call
        upon God?

027:011 I will teach you by the hand of God: that which is with the
        Almighty will I not conceal.

027:012 Behold, all ye yourselves have seen it; why then are ye thus
        altogether vain?

027:013 This is the portion of a wicked man with God, and the heritage
        of oppressors, which they shall receive of the Almighty.

027:014 If his children be multiplied, it is for the sword: and his
        offspring shall not be satisfied with bread.

027:015 Those that remain of him shall be buried in death: and his
        widows shall not weep.

027:016 Though he heap up silver as the dust, and prepare raiment as
        the clay;

027:017 He may prepare it, but the just shall put it on, and the
        innocent shall divide the silver.

027:018 He buildeth his house as a moth, and as a booth that the
        keeper maketh.

027:019 The rich man shall lie down, but he shall not be gathered: he
        openeth his eyes, and he is not.

027:020 Terrors take hold on him as waters, a tempest stealeth him
        away in the night.

027:021 The east wind carrieth him away, and he departeth: and as a
        storm hurleth him out of his place.

027:022 For God shall cast upon him, and not spare: he would fain flee
        out of his hand.

027:023 Men shall clap their hands at him, and shall hiss him out of
        his place.

028:001 Surely there is a vein for the silver, and a place for gold
        where they fine it.

028:002 Iron is taken out of the earth, and brass is molten out of the
        stone.

028:003 He setteth an end to darkness, and searcheth out all
        perfection: the stones of darkness, and the shadow of death.

028:004 The flood breaketh out from the inhabitant; even the waters
        forgotten of the foot: they are dried up, they are gone away
        from men.

028:005 As for the earth, out of it cometh bread: and under it is
        turned up as it were fire.

028:006 The stones of it are the place of sapphires: and it hath dust
        of gold.

028:007 There is a path which no fowl knoweth, and which the vulture's
        eye hath not seen:

028:008 The lion's whelps have not trodden it, nor the fierce lion
        passed by it.

028:009 He putteth forth his hand upon the rock; he overturneth the
        mountains by the roots.

028:010 He cutteth out rivers among the rocks; and his eye seeth every
        precious thing.

028:011 He bindeth the floods from overflowing; and the thing that is
        hid bringeth he forth to light.

028:012 But where shall wisdom be found? and where is the place of
        understanding?

028:013 Man knoweth not the price thereof; neither is it found in the
        land of the living.

028:014 The depth saith, It is not in me: and the sea saith, It is not
        with me.

028:015 It cannot be gotten for gold, neither shall silver be weighed
        for the price thereof.

028:016 It cannot be valued with the gold of Ophir, with the precious
        onyx, or the sapphire.

028:017 The gold and the crystal cannot equal it: and the exchange of
        it shall not be for jewels of fine gold.

028:018 No mention shall be made of coral, or of pearls: for the price
        of wisdom is above rubies.

028:019 The topaz of Ethiopia shall not equal it, neither shall it be
        valued with pure gold.

028:020 Whence then cometh wisdom? and where is the place of
        understanding?

028:021 Seeing it is hid from the eyes of all living, and kept close
        from the fowls of the air.

028:022 Destruction and death say, We have heard the fame thereof with
        our ears.

028:023 God understandeth the way thereof, and he knoweth the place
        thereof.

028:024 For he looketh to the ends of the earth, and seeth under the
        whole heaven;

028:025 To make the weight for the winds; and he weigheth the waters
        by measure.

028:026 When he made a decree for the rain, and a way for the
        lightning of the thunder:

028:027 Then did he see it, and declare it; he prepared it, yea, and
        searched it out.

028:028 And unto man he said, Behold, the fear of the LORD, that is
        wisdom; and to depart from evil is understanding.

029:001 Moreover Job continued his parable, and said,

029:002 Oh that I were as in months past, as in the days when God
        preserved me;

029:003 When his candle shined upon my head, and when by his light I
        walked through darkness;

029:004 As I was in the days of my youth, when the secret of God was
        upon my tabernacle;

029:005 When the Almighty was yet with me, when my children were about
        me;

029:006 When I washed my steps with butter, and the rock poured me out
        rivers of oil;

029:007 When I went out to the gate through the city, when I prepared
        my seat in the street!

029:008 The young men saw me, and hid themselves: and the aged arose,
        and stood up.

029:009 The princes refrained talking, and laid their hand on their
        mouth.

029:010 The nobles held their peace, and their tongue cleaved to the
        roof of their mouth.

029:011 When the ear heard me, then it blessed me; and when the eye
        saw me, it gave witness to me:

029:012 Because I delivered the poor that cried, and the fatherless,
        and him that had none to help him.

029:013 The blessing of him that was ready to perish came upon me: and
        I caused the widow's heart to sing for joy.

029:014 I put on righteousness, and it clothed me: my judgment was as
        a robe and a diadem.

029:015 I was eyes to the blind, and feet was I to the lame.

029:016 I was a father to the poor: and the cause which I knew not I
        searched out.

029:017 And I brake the jaws of the wicked, and plucked the spoil out
        of his teeth.

029:018 Then I said, I shall die in my nest, and I shall multiply my
        days as the sand.

029:019 My root was spread out by the waters, and the dew lay all
        night upon my branch.

029:020 My glory was fresh in me, and my bow was renewed in my hand.

029:021 Unto me men gave ear, and waited, and kept silence at my
        counsel.

029:022 After my words they spake not again; and my speech dropped
        upon them.

029:023 And they waited for me as for the rain; and they opened their
        mouth wide as for the latter rain.

029:024 If I laughed on them, they believed it not; and the light of
        my countenance they cast not down.

029:025 I chose out their way, and sat chief, and dwelt as a king in
        the army, as one that comforteth the mourners.

030:001 But now they that are younger than I have me in derision,
        whose fathers I would have disdained to have set with the dogs
        of my flock.

030:002 Yea, whereto might the strength of their hands profit me, in
        whom old age was perished?

030:003 For want and famine they were solitary; fleeing into the
        wilderness in former time desolate and waste.

030:004 Who cut up mallows by the bushes, and juniper roots for their
        meat.

030:005 They were driven forth from among men, (they cried after them
        as after a thief;)

030:006 To dwell in the cliffs of the valleys, in caves of the earth,
        and in the rocks.

030:007 Among the bushes they brayed; under the nettles they were
        gathered together.

030:008 They were children of fools, yea, children of base men: they
        were viler than the earth.

030:009 And now am I their song, yea, I am their byword.

030:010 They abhor me, they flee far from me, and spare not to spit in
        my face.

030:011 Because he hath loosed my cord, and afflicted me, they have
        also let loose the bridle before me.

030:012 Upon my right hand rise the youth; they push away my feet, and
        they raise up against me the ways of their destruction.

030:013 They mar my path, they set forward my calamity, they have no
        helper.

030:014 They came upon me as a wide breaking in of waters: in the
        desolation they rolled themselves upon me.

030:015 Terrors are turned upon me: they pursue my soul as the wind:
        and my welfare passeth away as a cloud.

030:016 And now my soul is poured out upon me; the days of affliction
        have taken hold upon me.

030:017 My bones are pierced in me in the night season: and my sinews
        take no rest.

030:018 By the great force of my disease is my garment changed: it
        bindeth me about as the collar of my coat.

030:019 He hath cast me into the mire, and I am become like dust and
        ashes.

030:020 I cry unto thee, and thou dost not hear me: I stand up, and
        thou regardest me not.

030:021 Thou art become cruel to me: with thy strong hand thou
        opposest thyself against me.

030:022 Thou liftest me up to the wind; thou causest me to ride upon
        it, and dissolvest my substance.

030:023 For I know that thou wilt bring me to death, and to the house
        appointed for all living.

030:024 Howbeit he will not stretch out his hand to the grave, though
        they cry in his destruction.

030:025 Did not I weep for him that was in trouble? was not my soul
        grieved for the poor?

030:026 When I looked for good, then evil came unto me: and when I
        waited for light, there came darkness.

030:027 My bowels boiled, and rested not: the days of affliction
        prevented me.

030:028 I went mourning without the sun: I stood up, and I cried in
        the congregation.

030:029 I am a brother to dragons, and a companion to owls.

030:030 My skin is black upon me, and my bones are burned with heat.

030:031 My harp also is turned to mourning, and my organ into the
        voice of them that weep.

031:001 I made a covenant with mine eyes; why then should I think upon
        a maid?

031:002 For what portion of God is there from above? and what
        inheritance of the Almighty from on high?

031:003 Is not destruction to the wicked? and a strange punishment to
        the workers of iniquity?

031:004 Doth not he see my ways, and count all my steps?

031:005 If I have walked with vanity, or if my foot hath hasted to
        deceit;

031:006 Let me be weighed in an even balance that God may know mine
        integrity.

031:007 If my step hath turned out of the way, and mine heart walked
        after mine eyes, and if any blot hath cleaved to mine hands;

031:008 Then let me sow, and let another eat; yea, let my offspring be
        rooted out.

031:009 If mine heart have been deceived by a woman, or if I have laid
        wait at my neighbour's door;

031:010 Then let my wife grind unto another, and let others bow down
        upon her.

031:011 For this is an heinous crime; yea, it is an iniquity to be
        punished by the judges.

031:012 For it is a fire that consumeth to destruction, and would root
        out all mine increase.

031:013 If I did despise the cause of my manservant or of my
        maidservant, when they contended with me;

031:014 What then shall I do when God riseth up? and when he visiteth,
        what shall I answer him?

031:015 Did not he that made me in the womb make him? and did not one
        fashion us in the womb?

031:016 If I have withheld the poor from their desire, or have caused
        the eyes of the widow to fail;

031:017 Or have eaten my morsel myself alone, and the fatherless hath
        not eaten thereof;

031:018 (For from my youth he was brought up with me, as with a
        father, and I have guided her from my mother's womb;)

031:019 If I have seen any perish for want of clothing, or any poor
        without covering;

031:020 If his loins have not blessed me, and if he were not warmed
        with the fleece of my sheep;

031:021 If I have lifted up my hand against the fatherless, when I saw
        my help in the gate:

031:022 Then let mine arm fall from my shoulder blade, and mine arm be
        broken from the bone.

031:023 For destruction from God was a terror to me, and by reason of
        his highness I could not endure.

031:024 If I have made gold my hope, or have said to the fine gold,
        Thou art my confidence;

031:025 If I rejoice because my wealth was great, and because mine
        hand had gotten much;

031:026 If I beheld the sun when it shined, or the moon walking in
        brightness;

031:027 And my heart hath been secretly enticed, or my mouth hath
        kissed my hand:

031:028 This also were an iniquity to be punished by the judge: for I
        should have denied the God that is above.

031:029 If I rejoice at the destruction of him that hated me, or
        lifted up myself when evil found him:

031:030 Neither have I suffered my mouth to sin by wishing a curse to
        his soul.

031:031 If the men of my tabernacle said not, Oh that we had of his
        flesh! we cannot be satisfied.

031:032 The stranger did not lodge in the street: but I opened my
        doors to the traveller.

031:033 If I covered my transgressions as Adam, by hiding mine
        iniquity in my bosom:

031:034 Did I fear a great multitude, or did the contempt of families
        terrify me, that I kept silence, and went not out of the door?

031:035 Oh that one would hear me! behold, my desire is, that the
        Almighty would answer me, and that mine adversary had written
        a book.

031:036 Surely I would take it upon my shoulder, and bind it as a
        crown to me.

031:037 I would declare unto him the number of my steps; as a prince
        would I go near unto him.

031:038 If my land cry against me, or that the furrows likewise
        thereof complain;

031:039 If I have eaten the fruits thereof without money, or have
        caused the owners thereof to lose their life:

031:040 Let thistles grow instead of wheat, and cockle instead of
        barley. The words of Job are ended.

032:001 So these three men ceased to answer Job, because he was
        righteous in his own eyes.

032:002 Then was kindled the wrath of Elihu the son of Barachel the
        Buzite, of the kindred of Ram: against Job was his wrath
        kindled, because he justified himself rather than God.

032:003 Also against his three friends was his wrath kindled, because
        they had found no answer, and yet had condemned Job.

032:004 Now Elihu had waited till Job had spoken, because they were
        elder than he.

032:005 When Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of these
        three men, then his wrath was kindled.

032:006 And Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered and said, I
        am young, and ye are very old; wherefore I was afraid, and
        durst not shew you mine opinion.

032:007 I said, Days should speak, and multitude of years should teach
        wisdom.

032:008 But there is a spirit in man: and the inspiration of the
        Almighty giveth them understanding.

032:009 Great men are not always wise: neither do the aged understand
        judgment.

032:010 Therefore I said, Hearken to me; I also will shew mine
        opinion.

032:011 Behold, I waited for your words; I gave ear to your reasons,
        whilst ye searched out what to say.

032:012 Yea, I attended unto you, and, behold, there was none of you
        that convinced Job, or that answered his words:

032:013 Lest ye should say, We have found out wisdom: God thrusteth
        him down, not man.

032:014 Now he hath not directed his words against me: neither will I
        answer him with your speeches.

032:015 They were amazed, they answered no more: they left off
        speaking.

032:016 When I had waited, (for they spake not, but stood still, and
        answered no more;)

032:017 I said, I will answer also my part, I also will shew mine
        opinion.

032:018 For I am full of matter, the spirit within me constraineth me.

032:019 Behold, my belly is as wine which hath no vent; it is ready to
        burst like new bottles.

032:020 I will speak, that I may be refreshed: I will open my lips and
        answer.

032:021 Let me not, I pray you, accept any man's person, neither let
        me give flattering titles unto man.

032:022 For I know not to give flattering titles; in so doing my maker
        would soon take me away.

033:001 Wherefore, Job, I pray thee, hear my speeches, and hearken to
        all my words.

033:002 Behold, now I have opened my mouth, my tongue hath spoken in
        my mouth.

033:003 My words shall be of the uprightness of my heart: and my lips
        shall utter knowledge clearly.

033:004 The spirit of God hath made me, and the breath of the Almighty
        hath given me life.

033:005 If thou canst answer me, set thy words in order before me,
        stand up.

033:006 Behold, I am according to thy wish in God's stead: I also am
        formed out of the clay.

033:007 Behold, my terror shall not make thee afraid, neither shall my
        hand be heavy upon thee.

033:008 Surely thou hast spoken in mine hearing, and I have heard the
        voice of thy words, saying,

033:009 I am clean without transgression, I am innocent; neither is
        there iniquity in me.

033:010 Behold, he findeth occasions against me, he counteth me for
        his enemy,

033:011 He putteth my feet in the stocks, he marketh all my paths.

033:012 Behold, in this thou art not just: I will answer thee, that
        God is greater than man.

033:013 Why dost thou strive against him? for he giveth not account of
        any of his matters.

033:014 For God speaketh once, yea twice, yet man perceiveth it not.

033:015 In a dream, in a vision of the night, when deep sleep falleth
        upon men, in slumberings upon the bed;

033:016 Then he openeth the ears of men, and sealeth their
        instruction,

033:017 That he may withdraw man from his purpose, and hide pride from
        man.

033:018 He keepeth back his soul from the pit, and his life from
        perishing by the sword.

033:019 He is chastened also with pain upon his bed, and the multitude
        of his bones with strong pain:

033:020 So that his life abhorreth bread, and his soul dainty meat.

033:021 His flesh is consumed away, that it cannot be seen; and his
        bones that were not seen stick out.

033:022 Yea, his soul draweth near unto the grave, and his life to the
        destroyers.

033:023 If there be a messenger with him, an interpreter, one among a
        thousand, to shew unto man his uprightness:

033:024 Then he is gracious unto him, and saith, Deliver him from
        going down to the pit: I have found a ransom.

033:025 His flesh shall be fresher than a child's: he shall return to
        the days of his youth:

033:026 He shall pray unto God, and he will be favourable unto him:
        and he shall see his face with joy: for he will render unto
        man his righteousness.

033:027 He looketh upon men, and if any say, I have sinned, and
        perverted that which was right, and it profited me not;

033:028 He will deliver his soul from going into the pit, and his life
        shall see the light.

033:029 Lo, all these things worketh God oftentimes with man,

033:030 To bring back his soul from the pit, to be enlightened with
        the light of the living.

033:031 Mark well, O Job, hearken unto me: hold thy peace, and I will
        speak.

033:032 If thou hast anything to say, answer me: speak, for I desire
        to justify thee.

033:033 If not, hearken unto me: hold thy peace, and I shall teach
        thee wisdom.

034:001 Furthermore Elihu answered and said,

034:002 Hear my words, O ye wise men; and give ear unto me, ye that
        have knowledge.

034:003 For the ear trieth words, as the mouth tasteth meat.

034:004 Let us choose to us judgment: let us know among ourselves what
        is good.

034:005 For Job hath said, I am righteous: and God hath taken away my
        judgment.

034:006 Should I lie against my right? my wound is incurable without
        transgression.

034:007 What man is like Job, who drinketh up scorning like water?

034:008 Which goeth in company with the workers of iniquity, and
        walketh with wicked men.

034:009 For he hath said, It profiteth a man nothing that he should
        delight himself with God.

034:010 Therefore hearken unto me ye men of understanding: far be it
        from God, that he should do wickedness; and from the Almighty,
        that he should commit iniquity.

034:011 For the work of a man shall he render unto him, and cause
        every man to find according to his ways.

034:012 Yea, surely God will not do wickedly, neither will the
        Almighty pervert judgment.

034:013 Who hath given him a charge over the earth? or who hath
        disposed the whole world?

034:014 If he set his heart upon man, if he gather unto himself his
        spirit and his breath;

034:015 All flesh shall perish together, and man shall turn again unto
        dust.

034:016 If now thou hast understanding, hear this: hearken to the
        voice of my words.

034:017 Shall even he that hateth right govern? and wilt thou condemn
        him that is most just?

034:018 Is it fit to say to a king, Thou art wicked? and to princes,
        Ye are ungodly?

034:019 How much less to him that accepteth not the persons of
        princes, nor regardeth the rich more than the poor? for they
        all are the work of his hands.

034:020 In a moment shall they die, and the people shall be troubled
        at midnight, and pass away: and the mighty shall be taken away
        without hand.

034:021 For his eyes are upon the ways of man, and he seeth all his
        goings.

034:022 There is no darkness, nor shadow of death, where the workers
        of iniquity may hide themselves.

034:023 For he will not lay upon man more than right; that he should
        enter into judgment with God.

034:024 He shall break in pieces mighty men without number, and set
        others in their stead.

034:025 Therefore he knoweth their works, and he overturneth them in
        the night, so that they are destroyed.

034:026 He striketh them as wicked men in the open sight of others;

034:027 Because they turned back from him, and would not consider any
        of his ways:

034:028 So that they cause the cry of the poor to come unto him, and
        he heareth the cry of the afflicted.

034:029 When he giveth quietness, who then can make trouble? and when
        he hideth his face, who then can behold him? whether it be
        done against a nation, or against a man only:

034:030 That the hypocrite reign not, lest the people be ensnared.

034:031 Surely it is meet to be said unto God, I have borne
        chastisement, I will not offend any more:

034:032 That which I see not teach thou me: if I have done iniquity, I
        will do no more.

034:033 Should it be according to thy mind? he will recompense it,
        whether thou refuse, or whether thou choose; and not I:
        therefore speak what thou knowest.

034:034 Let men of understanding tell me, and let a wise man hearken
        unto me.

034:035 Job hath spoken without knowledge, and his words were without
        wisdom.

034:036 My desire is that Job may be tried unto the end because of his
        answers for wicked men.

034:037 For he addeth rebellion unto his sin, he clappeth his hands
        among us, and multiplieth his words against God.

035:001 Elihu spake moreover, and said,

035:002 Thinkest thou this to be right, that thou saidst, My
        righteousness is more than God's?

035:003 For thou saidst, What advantage will it be unto thee? and,
        What profit shall I have, if I be cleansed from my sin?

035:004 I will answer thee, and thy companions with thee.

035:005 Look unto the heavens, and see; and behold the clouds which
        are higher than thou.

035:006 If thou sinnest, what doest thou against him? or if thy
        transgressions be multiplied, what doest thou unto him?

035:007 If thou be righteous, what givest thou him? or what receiveth
        he of thine hand?

035:008 Thy wickedness may hurt a man as thou art; and thy
        righteousness may profit the son of man.

035:009 By reason of the multitude of oppressions they make the
        oppressed to cry: they cry out by reason of the arm of the
        mighty.

035:010 But none saith, Where is God my maker, who giveth songs in the
        night;

035:011 Who teacheth us more than the beasts of the earth, and maketh
        us wiser than the fowls of heaven?

035:012 There they cry, but none giveth answer, because of the pride
        of evil men.

035:013 Surely God will not hear vanity, neither will the Almighty
        regard it.

035:014 Although thou sayest thou shalt not see him, yet judgment is
        before him; therefore trust thou in him.

035:015 But now, because it is not so, he hath visited in his anger;
        yet he knoweth it not in great extremity:

035:016 Therefore doth Job open his mouth in vain; he multiplieth
        words without knowledge.

036:001 Elihu also proceeded, and said,

036:002 Suffer me a little, and I will shew thee that I have yet to
        speak on God's behalf.

036:003 I will fetch my knowledge from afar, and will ascribe
        righteousness to my Maker.

036:004 For truly my words shall not be false: he that is perfect in
        knowledge is with thee.

036:005 Behold, God is mighty, and despiseth not any: he is mighty in
        strength and wisdom.

036:006 He preserveth not the life of the wicked: but giveth right to
        the poor.

036:007 He withdraweth not his eyes from the righteous: but with kings
        are they on the throne; yea, he doth establish them for ever,
        and they are exalted.

036:008 And if they be bound in fetters, and be holden in cords of
        affliction;

036:009 Then he sheweth them their work, and their transgressions that
        they have exceeded.

036:010 He openeth also their ear to discipline, and commandeth that
        they return from iniquity.

036:011 If they obey and serve him, they shall spend their days in
        prosperity, and their years in pleasures.

036:012 But if they obey not, they shall perish by the sword, and they
        shall die without knowledge.

036:013 But the hypocrites in heart heap up wrath: they cry not when
        he bindeth them.

036:014 They die in youth, and their life is among the unclean.

036:015 He delivereth the poor in his affliction, and openeth their
        ears in oppression.

036:016 Even so would he have removed thee out of the strait into a
        broad place, where there is no straitness; and that which
        should be set on thy table should be full of fatness.

036:017 But thou hast fulfilled the judgment of the wicked: judgment
        and justice take hold on thee.

036:018 Because there is wrath, beware lest he take thee away with his
        stroke: then a great ransom cannot deliver thee.

036:019 Will he esteem thy riches? no, not gold, nor all the forces of
        strength.

036:020 Desire not the night, when people are cut off in their place.

036:021 Take heed, regard not iniquity: for this hast thou chosen
        rather than affliction.

036:022 Behold, God exalteth by his power: who teacheth like him?

036:023 Who hath enjoined him his way? or who can say, Thou hast
        wrought iniquity?

036:024 Remember that thou magnify his work, which men behold.

036:025 Every man may see it; man may behold it afar off.

036:026 Behold, God is great, and we know him not, neither can the
        number of his years be searched out.

036:027 For he maketh small the drops of water: they pour down rain
        according to the vapour thereof:

036:028 Which the clouds do drop and distil upon man abundantly.

036:029 Also can any understand the spreadings of the clouds, or the
        noise of his tabernacle?

036:030 Behold, he spreadeth his light upon it, and covereth the
        bottom of the sea.

036:031 For by them judgeth he the people; he giveth meat in
        abundance.

036:032 With clouds he covereth the light; and commandeth it not to
        shine by the cloud that cometh betwixt.

036:033 The noise thereof sheweth concerning it, the cattle also
        concerning the vapour.

037:001 At this also my heart trembleth, and is moved out of his
        place.

037:002 Hear attentively the noise of his voice, and the sound that
        goeth out of his mouth.

037:003 He directeth it under the whole heaven, and his lightning unto
        the ends of the earth.

037:004 After it a voice roareth: he thundereth with the voice of his
        excellency; and he will not stay them when his voice is heard.

037:005 God thundereth marvellously with his voice; great things doeth
        he, which we cannot comprehend.

037:006 For he saith to the snow, Be thou on the earth; likewise to
        the small rain, and to the great rain of his strength.

037:007 He sealeth up the hand of every man; that all men may know his
        work.

037:008 Then the beasts go into dens, and remain in their places.

037:009 Out of the south cometh the whirlwind: and cold out of the
        north.

037:010 By the breath of God frost is given: and the breadth of the
        waters is straitened.

037:011 Also by watering he wearieth the thick cloud: he scattereth
        his bright cloud:

037:012 And it is turned round about by his counsels: that they may do
        whatsoever he commandeth them upon the face of the world in
        the earth.

037:013 He causeth it to come, whether for correction, or for his
        land, or for mercy.

037:014 Hearken unto this, O Job: stand still, and consider the
        wondrous works of God.

037:015 Dost thou know when God disposed them, and caused the light of
        his cloud to shine?

037:016 Dost thou know the balancings of the clouds, the wondrous
        works of him which is perfect in knowledge?

037:017 How thy garments are warm, when he quieteth the earth by the
        south wind?

037:018 Hast thou with him spread out the sky, which is strong, and as
        a molten looking glass?

037:019 Teach us what we shall say unto him; for we cannot order our
        speech by reason of darkness.

037:020 Shall it be told him that I speak? if a man speak, surely he
        shall be swallowed up.

037:021 And now men see not the bright light which is in the clouds:
        but the wind passeth, and cleanseth them.

037:022 Fair weather cometh out of the north: with God is terrible
        majesty.

037:023 Touching the Almighty, we cannot find him out: he is excellent
        in power, and in judgment, and in plenty of justice: he will
        not afflict.

037:024 Men do therefore fear him: he respecteth not any that are wise
        of heart.

038:001 Then the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind, and said,

038:002 Who is this that darkeneth counsel by words without knowledge?

038:003 Gird up now thy loins like a man; for I will demand of thee,
        and answer thou me.

038:004 Where wast thou when I laid the foundations of the earth?
        declare, if thou hast understanding.

038:005 Who hath laid the measures thereof, if thou knowest? or who
        hath stretched the line upon it?

038:006 Whereupon are the foundations thereof fastened? or who laid
        the corner stone thereof;

038:007 When the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God
        shouted for joy?

038:008 Or who shut up the sea with doors, when it brake forth, as if
        it had issued out of the womb?

038:009 When I made the cloud the garment thereof, and thick darkness
        a swaddlingband for it,

038:010 And brake up for it my decreed place, and set bars and doors,

038:011 And said, Hitherto shalt thou come, but no further: and here
        shall thy proud waves be stayed?

038:012 Hast thou commanded the morning since thy days; and caused the
        dayspring to know his place;

038:013 That it might take hold of the ends of the earth, that the
        wicked might be shaken out of it?

038:014 It is turned as clay to the seal; and they stand as a garment.

038:015 And from the wicked their light is withholden, and the high
        arm shall be broken.

038:016 Hast thou entered into the springs of the sea? or hast thou
        walked in the search of the depth?

038:017 Have the gates of death been opened unto thee? or hast thou
        seen the doors of the shadow of death?

038:018 Hast thou perceived the breadth of the earth? declare if thou
        knowest it all.

038:019 Where is the way where light dwelleth? and as for darkness,
        where is the place thereof,

038:020 That thou shouldest take it to the bound thereof, and that
        thou shouldest know the paths to the house thereof?

038:021 Knowest thou it, because thou wast then born? or because the
        number of thy days is great?

038:022 Hast thou entered into the treasures of the snow? or hast thou
        seen the treasures of the hail,

038:023 Which I have reserved against the time of trouble, against the
        day of battle and war?

038:024 By what way is the light parted, which scattereth the east
        wind upon the earth?

038:025 Who hath divided a watercourse for the overflowing of waters,
        or a way for the lightning of thunder;

038:026 To cause it to rain on the earth, where no man is; on the
        wilderness, wherein there is no man;

038:027 To satisfy the desolate and waste ground; and to cause the bud
        of the tender herb to spring forth?

038:028 Hath the rain a father? or who hath begotten the drops of dew?

038:029 Out of whose womb came the ice? and the hoary frost of heaven,
        who hath gendered it?

038:030 The waters are hid as with a stone, and the face of the deep
        is frozen.

038:031 Canst thou bind the sweet influences of Pleiades, or loose the
        bands of Orion?

038:032 Canst thou bring forth Mazzaroth in his season? or canst thou
        guide Arcturus with his sons?

038:033 Knowest thou the ordinances of heaven? canst thou set the
        dominion thereof in the earth?

038:034 Canst thou lift up thy voice to the clouds, that abundance of
        waters may cover thee?

038:035 Canst thou send lightnings, that they may go and say unto
        thee, Here we are?

038:036 Who hath put wisdom in the inward parts? or who hath given
        understanding to the heart?

038:037 Who can number the clouds in wisdom? or who can stay the
        bottles of heaven,

038:038 When the dust groweth into hardness, and the clods cleave fast
        together?

038:039 Wilt thou hunt the prey for the lion? or fill the appetite of
        the young lions,

038:040 When they couch in their dens, and abide in the covert to lie
        in wait?

038:041 Who provideth for the raven his food? when his young ones cry
        unto God, they wander for lack of meat.

039:001 Knowest thou the time when the wild goats of the rock bring
        forth? or canst thou mark when the hinds do calve?

039:002 Canst thou number the months that they fulfil? or knowest thou
        the time when they bring forth?

039:003 They bow themselves, they bring forth their young ones, they
        cast out their sorrows.

039:004 Their young ones are in good liking, they grow up with corn;
        they go forth, and return not unto them.

039:005 Who hath sent out the wild ass free? or who hath loosed the
        bands of the wild ass?

039:006 Whose house I have made the wilderness, and the barren land
        his dwellings.

039:007 He scorneth the multitude of the city, neither regardeth he
        the crying of the driver.

039:008 The range of the mountains is his pasture, and he searcheth
        after every green thing.

039:009 Will the unicorn be willing to serve thee, or abide by thy
        crib?

039:010 Canst thou bind the unicorn with his band in the furrow? or
        will he harrow the valleys after thee?

039:011 Wilt thou trust him, because his strength is great? or wilt
        thou leave thy labour to him?

039:012 Wilt thou believe him, that he will bring home thy seed, and
        gather it into thy barn?

039:013 Gavest thou the goodly wings unto the peacocks? or wings and
        feathers unto the ostrich?

039:014 Which leaveth her eggs in the earth, and warmeth them in dust,

039:015 And forgetteth that the foot may crush them, or that the wild
        beast may break them.

039:016 She is hardened against her young ones, as though they were
        not her's: her labour is in vain without fear;

039:017 Because God hath deprived her of wisdom, neither hath he
        imparted to her understanding.

039:018 What time she lifteth up herself on high, she scorneth the
        horse and his rider.

039:019 Hast thou given the horse strength? hast thou clothed his neck
        with thunder?

039:020 Canst thou make him afraid as a grasshopper? the glory of his
        nostrils is terrible.

039:021 He paweth in the valley, and rejoiceth in his strength: he
        goeth on to meet the armed men.

039:022 He mocketh at fear, and is not affrighted; neither turneth he
        back from the sword.

039:023 The quiver rattleth against him, the glittering spear and the
        shield.

039:024 He swalloweth the ground with fierceness and rage: neither
        believeth he that it is the sound of the trumpet.

039:025 He saith among the trumpets, Ha, ha; and he smelleth the
        battle afar off, the thunder of the captains, and the
        shouting.

039:026 Doth the hawk fly by thy wisdom, and stretch her wings toward
        the south?

039:027 Doth the eagle mount up at thy command, and make her nest on
        high?

039:028 She dwelleth and abideth on the rock, upon the crag of the
        rock, and the strong place.

039:029 From thence she seeketh the prey, and her eyes behold afar
        off.

039:030 Her young ones also suck up blood: and where the slain are,
        there is she.

040:001 Moreover the LORD answered Job, and said,

040:002 Shall he that contendeth with the Almighty instruct him? he
        that reproveth God, let him answer it.

040:003 Then Job answered the LORD, and said,

040:004 Behold, I am vile; what shall I answer thee? I will lay mine
        hand upon my mouth.

040:005 Once have I spoken; but I will not answer: yea, twice; but I
        will proceed no further.

040:006 Then answered the LORD unto Job out of the whirlwind, and
        said,

040:007 Gird up thy loins now like a man: I will demand of thee, and
        declare thou unto me.

040:008 Wilt thou also disannul my judgment? wilt thou condemn me,
        that thou mayest be righteous?

040:009 Hast thou an arm like God? or canst thou thunder with a voice
        like him?

040:010 Deck thyself now with majesty and excellency; and array
        thyself with glory and beauty.

040:011 Cast abroad the rage of thy wrath: and behold every one that
        is proud, and abase him.

040:012 Look on every one that is proud, and bring him low; and tread
        down the wicked in their place.

040:013 Hide them in the dust together; and bind their faces in
        secret.

040:014 Then will I also confess unto thee that thine own right hand
        can save thee.

040:015 Behold now behemoth, which I made with thee; he eateth grass
        as an ox.

040:016 Lo now, his strength is in his loins, and his force is in the
        navel of his belly.

040:017 He moveth his tail like a cedar: the sinews of his stones are
        wrapped together.

040:018 His bones are as strong pieces of brass; his bones are like
        bars of iron.

040:019 He is the chief of the ways of God: he that made him can make
        his sword to approach unto him.

040:020 Surely the mountains bring him forth food, where all the
        beasts of the field play.

040:021 He lieth under the shady trees, in the covert of the reed, and
        fens.

040:022 The shady trees cover him with their shadow; the willows of
        the brook compass him about.

040:023 Behold, he drinketh up a river, and hasteth not: he trusteth
        that he can draw up Jordan into his mouth.

040:024 He taketh it with his eyes: his nose pierceth through snares.

041:001 Canst thou draw out leviathan with an hook? or his tongue with
        a cord which thou lettest down?

041:002 Canst thou put an hook into his nose? or bore his jaw through
        with a thorn?

041:003 Will he make many supplications unto thee? will he speak soft
        words unto thee?

041:004 Will he make a covenant with thee? wilt thou take him for a
        servant for ever?

041:005 Wilt thou play with him as with a bird? or wilt thou bind him
        for thy maidens?

041:006 Shall the companions make a banquet of him? shall they part
        him among the merchants?

041:007 Canst thou fill his skin with barbed irons? or his head with
        fish spears?

041:008 Lay thine hand upon him, remember the battle, do no more.

041:009 Behold, the hope of him is in vain: shall not one be cast down
        even at the sight of him?

041:010 None is so fierce that dare stir him up: who then is able to
        stand before me?

041:011 Who hath prevented me, that I should repay him? whatsoever is
        under the whole heaven is mine.

041:012 I will not conceal his parts, nor his power, nor his comely
        proportion.

041:013 Who can discover the face of his garment? or who can come to
        him with his double bridle?

041:014 Who can open the doors of his face? his teeth are terrible
        round about.

041:015 His scales are his pride, shut up together as with a close
        seal.

041:016 One is so near to another, that no air can come between them.

041:017 They are joined one to another, they stick together, that they
        cannot be sundered.

041:018 By his neesings a light doth shine, and his eyes are like the
        eyelids of the morning.

041:019 Out of his mouth go burning lamps, and sparks of fire leap
        out.

041:020 Out of his nostrils goeth smoke, as out of a seething pot or
        caldron.

041:021 His breath kindleth coals, and a flame goeth out of his mouth.

041:022 In his neck remaineth strength, and sorrow is turned into joy
        before him.

041:023 The flakes of his flesh are joined together: they are firm in
        themselves; they cannot be moved.

041:024 His heart is as firm as a stone; yea, as hard as a piece of
        the nether millstone.

041:025 When he raiseth up himself, the mighty are afraid: by reason
        of breakings they purify themselves.

041:026 The sword of him that layeth at him cannot hold: the spear,
        the dart, nor the habergeon.

041:027 He esteemeth iron as straw, and brass as rotten wood.

041:028 The arrow cannot make him flee: slingstones are turned with
        him into stubble.

041:029 Darts are counted as stubble: he laugheth at the shaking of a
        spear.

041:030 Sharp stones are under him: he spreadeth sharp pointed things
        upon the mire.

041:031 He maketh the deep to boil like a pot: he maketh the sea like
        a pot of ointment.

041:032 He maketh a path to shine after him; one would think the deep
        to be hoary.

041:033 Upon earth there is not his like, who is made without fear.

041:034 He beholdeth all high things: he is a king over all the
        children of pride.

042:001 Then Job answered the LORD, and said,

042:002 I know that thou canst do every thing, and that no thought can
        be withholden from thee.

042:003 Who is he that hideth counsel without knowledge? therefore
        have I uttered that I understood not; things too wonderful for
        me, which I knew not.

042:004 Hear, I beseech thee, and I will speak: I will demand of thee,
        and declare thou unto me.

042:005 I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear: but now mine
        eye seeth thee.

042:006 Wherefore I abhor myself, and repent in dust and ashes.

042:007 And it was so, that after the LORD had spoken these words unto
        Job, the LORD said to Eliphaz the Temanite, My wrath is
        kindled against thee, and against thy two friends: for ye have
        not spoken of me the thing that is right, as my servant Job
        hath.

042:008 Therefore take unto you now seven bullocks and seven rams, and
        go to my servant Job, and offer up for yourselves a burnt
        offering; and my servant Job shall pray for you: for him will
        I accept: lest I deal with you after your folly, in that ye
        have not spoken of me the thing which is right, like my
        servant Job.

042:009 So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the
        Naamathite went, and did according as the LORD commanded them:
        the LORD also accepted Job.

042:010 And the LORD turned the captivity of Job, when he prayed for
        his friends: also the LORD gave Job twice as much as he had
        before.

042:011 Then came there unto him all his brethren, and all his
        sisters, and all they that had been of his acquaintance
        before, and did eat bread with him in his house: and they
        bemoaned him, and comforted him over all the evil that the
        LORD had brought upon him: every man also gave him a piece of
        money, and every one an earring of gold.

042:012 So the LORD blessed the latter end of Job more than his
        beginning: for he had fourteen thousand sheep, and six
        thousand camels, and a thousand yoke of oxen, and a thousand
        she asses.

042:013 He had also seven sons and three daughters.

042:014 And he called the name of the first, Jemima; and the name of
        the second, Kezia; and the name of the third, Kerenhappuch.

042:015 And in all the land were no women found so fair as the
        daughters of Job: and their father gave them inheritance among
        their brethren.

042:016 After this lived Job an hundred and forty years, and saw his
        sons, and his sons' sons, even four generations.

042:017 So Job died, being old and full of days.

Book 19	Psalms

001:001 Blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the
        ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in
        the seat of the scornful.

001:002 But his delight is in the law of the LORD; and in his law doth
        he meditate day and night.

001:003 And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water,
        that bringeth forth his fruit in his season; his leaf also
        shall not wither; and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper.

001:004 The ungodly are not so: but are like the chaff which the wind
        driveth away.

001:005 Therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the judgment, nor
        sinners in the congregation of the righteous.

001:006 For the LORD knoweth the way of the righteous: but the way of
        the ungodly shall perish.

002:001 Why do the heathen rage, and the people imagine a vain thing?

002:002 The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take
        counsel together, against the LORD, and against his anointed,
        saying,

002:003 Let us break their bands asunder, and cast away their cords
        from us.

002:004 He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh: the LORD shall
        have them in derision.

002:005 Then shall he speak unto them in his wrath, and vex them in
        his sore displeasure.

002:006 Yet have I set my king upon my holy hill of Zion.

002:007 I will declare the decree: the LORD hath said unto me, Thou
        art my Son; this day have I begotten thee.

002:008 Ask of me, and I shall give thee the heathen for thine
        inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth for thy
        possession.

002:009 Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron; thou shalt dash them
        in pieces like a potter's vessel.

002:010 Be wise now therefore, O ye kings: be instructed, ye judges of
        the earth.

002:011 Serve the LORD with fear, and rejoice with trembling.

002:012 Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and ye perish from the way,
        when his wrath is kindled but a little. Blessed are all they
        that put their trust in him.

003:001 Lord, how are they increased that trouble me! many are they
        that rise up against me.

003:002 Many there be which say of my soul, There is no help for him
        in God. Selah.

003:003 But thou, O LORD, art a shield for me; my glory, and the
        lifter up of mine head.

003:004 I cried unto the LORD with my voice, and he heard me out of
        his holy hill. Selah.

003:005 I laid me down and slept; I awaked; for the LORD sustained me.

003:006 I will not be afraid of ten thousands of people, that have set
        themselves against me round about.

003:007 Arise, O LORD; save me, O my God: for thou hast smitten all
        mine enemies upon the cheek bone; thou hast broken the teeth
        of the ungodly.

003:008 Salvation belongeth unto the LORD: thy blessing is upon thy
        people. Selah.

004:001 Hear me when I call, O God of my righteousness: thou hast
        enlarged me when I was in distress; have mercy upon me, and
        hear my prayer.

004:002 O ye sons of men, how long will ye turn my glory into shame?
        how long will ye love vanity, and seek after leasing? Selah.

004:003 But know that the LORD hath set apart him that is godly for
        himself: the LORD will hear when I call unto him.

004:004 Stand in awe, and sin not: commune with your own heart upon
        your bed, and be still. Selah.

004:005 Offer the sacrifices of righteousness, and put your trust in
        the LORD.

004:006 There be many that say, Who will shew us any good? LORD, lift
        thou up the light of thy countenance upon us.

004:007 Thou hast put gladness in my heart, more than in the time that
        their corn and their wine increased.

004:008 I will both lay me down in peace, and sleep: for thou, LORD,
        only makest me dwell in safety.

005:001 Give ear to my words, O LORD, consider my meditation.

005:002 Hearken unto the voice of my cry, my King, and my God: for
        unto thee will I pray.

005:003 My voice shalt thou hear in the morning, O LORD; in the
        morning will I direct my prayer unto thee, and will look up.

005:004 For thou art not a God that hath pleasure in wickedness:
        neither shall evil dwell with thee.

005:005 The foolish shall not stand in thy sight: thou hatest all
        workers of iniquity.

005:006 Thou shalt destroy them that speak leasing: the LORD will
        abhor the bloody and deceitful man.

005:007 But as for me, I will come into thy house in the multitude of
        thy mercy: and in thy fear will I worship toward thy holy
        temple.

005:008 Lead me, O LORD, in thy righteousness because of mine enemies;
        make thy way straight before my face.

005:009 For there is no faithfulness in their mouth; their inward part
        is very wickedness; their throat is an open sepulchre; they
        flatter with their tongue.

005:010 Destroy thou them, O God; let them fall by their own counsels;
        cast them out in the multitude of their transgressions; for
        they have rebelled against thee.

005:011 But let all those that put their trust in thee rejoice: let
        them ever shout for joy, because thou defendest them: let them
        also that love thy name be joyful in thee.

005:012 For thou, LORD, wilt bless the righteous; with favour wilt
        thou compass him as with a shield.

006:001 O LORD, rebuke me not in thine anger, neither chasten me in
        thy hot displeasure.

006:002 Have mercy upon me, O LORD; for I am weak: O LORD, heal me;
        for my bones are vexed.

006:003 My soul is also sore vexed: but thou, O LORD, how long?

006:004 Return, O LORD, deliver my soul: oh save me for thy mercies'
        sake.

006:005 For in death there is no remembrance of thee: in the grave who
        shall give thee thanks?

006:006 I am weary with my groaning; all the night make I my bed to
        swim; I water my couch with my tears.

006:007 Mine eye is consumed because of grief; it waxeth old because
        of all mine enemies.

006:008 Depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity; for the LORD hath
        heard the voice of my weeping.

006:009 The LORD hath heard my supplication; the LORD will receive my
        prayer.

006:010 Let all mine enemies be ashamed and sore vexed: let them
        return and be ashamed suddenly.

007:001 O LORD my God, in thee do I put my trust: save me from all
        them that persecute me, and deliver me:

007:002 Lest he tear my soul like a lion, rending it in pieces, while
        there is none to deliver.

007:003 O LORD my God, If I have done this; if there be iniquity in my
        hands;

007:004 If I have rewarded evil unto him that was at peace with me;
        (yea, I have delivered him that without cause is mine enemy:)

007:005 Let the enemy persecute my soul, and take it; yea, let him
        tread down my life upon the earth, and lay mine honour in the
        dust. Selah.

007:006 Arise, O LORD, in thine anger, lift up thyself because of the
        rage of mine enemies: and awake for me to the judgment that
        thou hast commanded.

007:007 So shall the congregation of the people compass thee about:
        for their sakes therefore return thou on high.

007:008 The LORD shall judge the people: judge me, O LORD, according
        to my righteousness, and according to mine integrity that is
        in me.

007:009 Oh let the wickedness of the wicked come to an end; but
        establish the just: for the righteous God trieth the hearts
        and reins.

007:010 My defence is of God, which saveth the upright in heart.

007:011 God judgeth the righteous, and God is angry with the wicked
        every day.

007:012 If he turn not, he will whet his sword; he hath bent his bow,
        and made it ready.

007:013 He hath also prepared for him the instruments of death; he
        ordaineth his arrows against the persecutors.

007:014 Behold, he travaileth with iniquity, and hath conceived
        mischief, and brought forth falsehood.

007:015 He made a pit, and digged it, and is fallen into the ditch
        which he made.

007:016 His mischief shall return upon his own head, and his violent
        dealing shall come down upon his own pate.

007:017 I will praise the LORD according to his righteousness: and
        will sing praise to the name of the LORD most high.

008:001 O LORD, our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth!
        who hast set thy glory above the heavens.

008:002 Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings hast thou ordained
        strength because of thine enemies, that thou mightest still
        the enemy and the avenger.

008:003 When I consider thy heavens, the work of thy fingers, the moon
        and the stars, which thou hast ordained;

008:004 What is man, that thou art mindful of him? and the son of man,
        that thou visitest him?

008:005 For thou hast made him a little lower than the angels, and
        hast crowned him with glory and honour.

008:006 Thou madest him to have dominion over the works of thy hands;
        thou hast put all things under his feet:

008:007 All sheep and oxen, yea, and the beasts of the field;

008:008 The fowl of the air, and the fish of the sea, and whatsoever
        passeth through the paths of the seas.

008:009 O LORD our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth!

009:001 I will praise thee, O LORD, with my whole heart; I will shew
        forth all thy marvellous works.

009:002 I will be glad and rejoice in thee: I will sing praise to thy
        name, O thou most High.

009:003 When mine enemies are turned back, they shall fall and perish
        at thy presence.

009:004 For thou hast maintained my right and my cause; thou satest in
        the throne judging right.

009:005 Thou hast rebuked the heathen, thou hast destroyed the wicked,
        thou hast put out their name for ever and ever.

009:006 O thou enemy, destructions are come to a perpetual end: and
        thou hast destroyed cities; their memorial is perished with
        them.

009:007 But the LORD shall endure for ever: he hath prepared his
        throne for judgment.

009:008 And he shall judge the world in righteousness, he shall
        minister judgment to the people in uprightness.

009:009 The LORD also will be a refuge for the oppressed, a refuge in
        times of trouble.

009:010 And they that know thy name will put their trust in thee: for
        thou, LORD, hast not forsaken them that seek thee.

009:011 Sing praises to the LORD, which dwelleth in Zion: declare
        among the people his doings.

009:012 When he maketh inquisition for blood, he remembereth them: he
        forgetteth not the cry of the humble.

009:013 Have mercy upon me, O LORD; consider my trouble which I suffer
        of them that hate me, thou that liftest me up from the gates
        of death:

009:014 That I may shew forth all thy praise in the gates of the
        daughter of Zion: I will rejoice in thy salvation.

009:015 The heathen are sunk down in the pit that they made: in the
        net which they hid is their own foot taken.

009:016 The LORD is known by the judgment which he executeth: the
        wicked is snared in the work of his own hands. Higgaion.
        Selah.

009:017 The wicked shall be turned into hell, and all the nations that
        forget God.

009:018 For the needy shall not alway be forgotten: the expectation of
        the poor shall not perish for ever.

009:019 Arise, O LORD; let not man prevail: let the heathen be judged
        in thy sight.

009:020 Put them in fear, O LORD: that the nations may know themselves
        to be but men. Selah.

010:001 Why standest thou afar off, O LORD? why hidest thou thyself in
        times of trouble?

010:002 The wicked in his pride doth persecute the poor: let them be
        taken in the devices that they have imagined.

010:003 For the wicked boasteth of his heart's desire, and blesseth
        the covetous, whom the LORD abhorreth.

010:004 The wicked, through the pride of his countenance, will not
        seek after God: God is not in all his thoughts.

010:005 His ways are always grievous; thy judgments are far above out
        of his sight: as for all his enemies, he puffeth at them.

010:006 He hath said in his heart, I shall not be moved: for I shall
        never be in adversity.

010:007 His mouth is full of cursing and deceit and fraud: under his
        tongue is mischief and vanity.

010:008 He sitteth in the lurking places of the villages: in the
        secret places doth he murder the innocent: his eyes are
        privily set against the poor.

010:009 He lieth in wait secretly as a lion in his den: he lieth in
        wait to catch the poor: he doth catch the poor, when he
        draweth him into his net.

010:010 He croucheth, and humbleth himself, that the poor may fall by
        his strong ones.

010:011 He hath said in his heart, God hath forgotten: he hideth his
        face; he will never see it.

010:012 Arise, O LORD; O God, lift up thine hand: forget not the
        humble.

010:013 Wherefore doth the wicked contemn God? he hath said in his
        heart, Thou wilt not require it.

010:014 Thou hast seen it; for thou beholdest mischief and spite, to
        requite it with thy hand: the poor committeth himself unto
        thee; thou art the helper of the fatherless.

010:015 Break thou the arm of the wicked and the evil man: seek out
        his wickedness till thou find none.

010:016 The LORD is King for ever and ever: the heathen are perished
        out of his land.

010:017 LORD, thou hast heard the desire of the humble: thou wilt
        prepare their heart, thou wilt cause thine ear to hear:

010:018 To judge the fatherless and the oppressed, that the man of the
        earth may no more oppress.

011:001 In the LORD put I my trust: how say ye to my soul, Flee as a
        bird to your mountain?

011:002 For, lo, the wicked bend their bow, they make ready their
        arrow upon the string, that they may privily shoot at the
        upright in heart.

011:003 If the foundations be destroyed, what can the righteous do?

011:004 The LORD is in his holy temple, the LORD's throne is in
        heaven: his eyes behold, his eyelids try, the children of men.

011:005 The LORD trieth the righteous: but the wicked and him that
        loveth violence his soul hateth.

011:006 Upon the wicked he shall rain snares, fire and brimstone, and
        an horrible tempest: this shall be the portion of their cup.

011:007 For the righteous LORD loveth righteousness; his countenance
        doth behold the upright.

012:001 Help, LORD; for the godly man ceaseth; for the faithful fail
        from among the children of men.

012:002 They speak vanity every one with his neighbour: with
        flattering lips and with a double heart do they speak.

012:003 The LORD shall cut off all flattering lips, and the tongue
        that speaketh proud things:

012:004 Who have said, With our tongue will we prevail; our lips are
        our own: who is lord over us?

012:005 For the oppression of the poor, for the sighing of the needy,
        now will I arise, saith the LORD; I will set him in safety
        from him that puffeth at him.

012:006 The words of the LORD are pure words: as silver tried in a
        furnace of earth, purified seven times.

012:007 Thou shalt keep them, O LORD, thou shalt preserve them from
        this generation for ever.

012:008 The wicked walk on every side, when the vilest men are
        exalted.

013:001 How long wilt thou forget me, O LORD? for ever? how long wilt
        thou hide thy face from me?

013:002 How long shall I take counsel in my soul, having sorrow in my
        heart daily? how long shall mine enemy be exalted over me?

013:003 Consider and hear me, O LORD my God: lighten mine eyes, lest I
        sleep the sleep of death;

013:004 Lest mine enemy say, I have prevailed against him; and those
        that trouble me rejoice when I am moved.

013:005 But I have trusted in thy mercy; my heart shall rejoice in thy
        salvation.

013:006 I will sing unto the LORD, because he hath dealt bountifully
        with me.

014:001 The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God. They are
        corrupt, they have done abominable works, there is none that
        doeth good.

014:002 The LORD looked down from heaven upon the children of men, to
        see if there were any that did understand, and seek God.

014:003 They are all gone aside, they are all together become filthy:
        there is none that doeth good, no, not one.

014:004 Have all the workers of iniquity no knowledge? who eat up my
        people as they eat bread, and call not upon the LORD.

014:005 There were they in great fear: for God is in the generation of
        the righteous.

014:006 Ye have shamed the counsel of the poor, because the LORD is
        his refuge.

014:007 Oh that the salvation of Israel were come out of Zion! when
        the LORD bringeth back the captivity of his people, Jacob
        shall rejoice, and Israel shall be glad.

015:001 Lord, who shall abide in thy tabernacle? who shall dwell in
        thy holy hill?

015:002 He that walketh uprightly, and worketh righteousness, and
        speaketh the truth in his heart.

015:003 He that backbiteth not with his tongue, nor doeth evil to his
        neighbour, nor taketh up a reproach against his neighbour.

015:004 In whose eyes a vile person is contemned; but he honoureth
        them that fear the LORD. He that sweareth to his own hurt, and
        changeth not.

015:005 He that putteth not out his money to usury, nor taketh reward
        against the innocent. He that doeth these things shall never
        be moved.

016:001 Preserve me, O God: for in thee do I put my trust.

016:002 O my soul, thou hast said unto the LORD, Thou art my Lord: my
        goodness extendeth not to thee;

016:003 But to the saints that are in the earth, and to the excellent,
        in whom is all my delight.

016:004 Their sorrows shall be multiplied that hasten after another
        god: their drink offerings of blood will I not offer, nor take
        up their names into my lips.

016:005 The LORD is the portion of mine inheritance and of my cup:
        thou maintainest my lot.

016:006 The lines are fallen unto me in pleasant places; yea, I have a
        goodly heritage.

016:007 I will bless the LORD, who hath given me counsel: my reins
        also instruct me in the night seasons.

016:008 I have set the LORD always before me: because he is at my
        right hand, I shall not be moved.

016:009 Therefore my heart is glad, and my glory rejoiceth: my flesh
        also shall rest in hope.

016:010 For thou wilt not leave my soul in hell; neither wilt thou
        suffer thine Holy One to see corruption.

016:011 Thou wilt shew me the path of life: in thy presence is fulness
        of joy; at thy right hand there are pleasures for evermore.

017:001 Hear the right, O LORD, attend unto my cry, give ear unto my
        prayer, that goeth not out of feigned lips.

017:002 Let my sentence come forth from thy presence; let thine eyes
        behold the things that are equal.

017:003 Thou hast proved mine heart; thou hast visited me in the
        night; thou hast tried me, and shalt find nothing; I am
        purposed that my mouth shall not transgress.

017:004 Concerning the works of men, by the word of thy lips I have
        kept me from the paths of the destroyer.

017:005 Hold up my goings in thy paths, that my footsteps slip not.

017:006 I have called upon thee, for thou wilt hear me, O God: incline
        thine ear unto me, and hear my speech.

017:007 Shew thy marvellous lovingkindness, O thou that savest by thy
        right hand them which put their trust in thee from those that
        rise up against them.

017:008 Keep me as the apple of the eye, hide me under the shadow of
        thy wings,

017:009 From the wicked that oppress me, from my deadly enemies, who
        compass me about.

017:010 They are inclosed in their own fat: with their mouth they
        speak proudly.

017:011 They have now compassed us in our steps: they have set their
        eyes bowing down to the earth;

017:012 Like as a lion that is greedy of his prey, and as it were a
        young lion lurking in secret places.

017:013 Arise, O LORD, disappoint him, cast him down: deliver my soul
        from the wicked, which is thy sword:

017:014 From men which are thy hand, O LORD, from men of the world,
        which have their portion in this life, and whose belly thou
        fillest with thy hid treasure: they are full of children, and
        leave the rest of their substance to their babes.

017:015 As for me, I will behold thy face in righteousness: I shall be
        satisfied, when I awake, with thy likeness.

018:001 I will love thee, O LORD, my strength.

018:002 The LORD is my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer; my
        God, my strength, in whom I will trust; my buckler, and the
        horn of my salvation, and my high tower.

018:003 I will call upon the LORD, who is worthy to be praised: so
        shall I be saved from mine enemies.

018:004 The sorrows of death compassed me, and the floods of ungodly
        men made me afraid.

018:005 The sorrows of hell compassed me about: the snares of death
        prevented me.

018:006 In my distress I called upon the LORD, and cried unto my God:
        he heard my voice out of his temple, and my cry came before
        him, even into his ears.

018:007 Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations also of the
        hills moved and were shaken, because he was wroth.

018:008 There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his
        mouth devoured: coals were kindled by it.

018:009 He bowed the heavens also, and came down: and darkness was
        under his feet.

018:010 And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly: yea, he did fly upon
        the wings of the wind.

018:011 He made darkness his secret place; his pavilion round about
        him were dark waters and thick clouds of the skies.

018:012 At the brightness that was before him his thick clouds passed,
        hail stones and coals of fire.

018:013 The LORD also thundered in the heavens, and the Highest gave
        his voice; hail stones and coals of fire.

018:014 Yea, he sent out his arrows, and scattered them; and he shot
        out lightnings, and discomfited them.

018:015 Then the channels of waters were seen, and the foundations of
        the world were discovered at thy rebuke, O LORD, at the blast
        of the breath of thy nostrils.

018:016 He sent from above, he took me, he drew me out of many waters.

018:017 He delivered me from my strong enemy, and from them which
        hated me: for they were too strong for me.

018:018 They prevented me in the day of my calamity: but the LORD was
        my stay.

018:019 He brought me forth also into a large place; he delivered me,
        because he delighted in me.

018:020 The LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness; according
        to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me.

018:021 For I have kept the ways of the LORD, and have not wickedly
        departed from my God.

018:022 For all his judgments were before me, and I did not put away
        his statutes from me.

018:023 I was also upright before him, and I kept myself from mine
        iniquity.

018:024 Therefore hath the LORD recompensed me according to my
        righteousness, according to the cleanness of my hands in his
        eyesight.

018:025 With the merciful thou wilt shew thyself merciful; with an
        upright man thou wilt shew thyself upright;

018:026 With the pure thou wilt shew thyself pure; and with the
        froward thou wilt shew thyself froward.

018:027 For thou wilt save the afflicted people; but wilt bring down
        high looks.

018:028 For thou wilt light my candle: the LORD my God will enlighten
        my darkness.

018:029 For by thee I have run through a troop; and by my God have I
        leaped over a wall.

018:030 As for God, his way is perfect: the word of the LORD is tried:
        he is a buckler to all those that trust in him.

018:031 For who is God save the LORD? or who is a rock save our God?

018:032 It is God that girdeth me with strength, and maketh my way
        perfect.

018:033 He maketh my feet like hinds' feet, and setteth me upon my
        high places.

018:034 He teacheth my hands to war, so that a bow of steel is broken
        by mine arms.

018:035 Thou hast also given me the shield of thy salvation: and thy
        right hand hath holden me up, and thy gentleness hath made me
        great.

018:036 Thou hast enlarged my steps under me, that my feet did not
        slip.

018:037 I have pursued mine enemies, and overtaken them: neither did I
        turn again till they were consumed.

018:038 I have wounded them that they were not able to rise: they are
        fallen under my feet.

018:039 For thou hast girded me with strength unto the battle: thou
        hast subdued under me those that rose up against me.

018:040 Thou hast also given me the necks of mine enemies; that I
        might destroy them that hate me.

018:041 They cried, but there was none to save them: even unto the
        LORD, but he answered them not.

018:042 Then did I beat them small as the dust before the wind: I did
        cast them out as the dirt in the streets.

018:043 Thou hast delivered me from the strivings of the people; and
        thou hast made me the head of the heathen: a people whom I
        have not known shall serve me.

018:044 As soon as they hear of me, they shall obey me: the strangers
        shall submit themselves unto me.

018:045 The strangers shall fade away, and be afraid out of their
        close places.

018:046 The LORD liveth; and blessed be my rock; and let the God of my
        salvation be exalted.

018:047 It is God that avengeth me, and subdueth the people under me.

018:048 He delivereth me from mine enemies: yea, thou liftest me up
        above those that rise up against me: thou hast delivered me
        from the violent man.

018:049 Therefore will I give thanks unto thee, O LORD, among the
        heathen, and sing praises unto thy name.

018:050 Great deliverance giveth he to his king; and sheweth mercy to
        his anointed, to David, and to his seed for evermore.

019:001 The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament
        sheweth his handywork.

019:002 Day unto day uttereth speech, and night unto night sheweth
        knowledge.

019:003 There is no speech nor language, where their voice is not
        heard.

019:004 Their line is gone out through all the earth, and their words
        to the end of the world. In them hath he set a tabernacle for
        the sun,

019:005 Which is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber, and
        rejoiceth as a strong man to run a race.

019:006 His going forth is from the end of the heaven, and his circuit
        unto the ends of it: and there is nothing hid from the heat
        thereof.

019:007 The law of the LORD is perfect, converting the soul: the
        testimony of the LORD is sure, making wise the simple.

019:008 The statutes of the LORD are right, rejoicing the heart: the
        commandment of the LORD is pure, enlightening the eyes.

019:009 The fear of the LORD is clean, enduring for ever: the
        judgments of the LORD are true and righteous altogether.

019:010 More to be desired are they than gold, yea, than much fine
        gold: sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb.

019:011 Moreover by them is thy servant warned: and in keeping of them
        there is great reward.

019:012 Who can understand his errors? cleanse thou me from secret
        faults.

019:013 Keep back thy servant also from presumptuous sins; let them
        not have dominion over me: then shall I be upright, and I
        shall be innocent from the great transgression.

019:014 Let the words of my mouth, and the meditation of my heart, be
        acceptable in thy sight, O LORD, my strength, and my redeemer.

020:001 The LORD hear thee in the day of trouble; the name of the God
        of Jacob defend thee;

020:002 Send thee help from the sanctuary, and strengthen thee out of
        Zion;

020:003 Remember all thy offerings, and accept thy burnt sacrifice;
        Selah.

020:004 Grant thee according to thine own heart, and fulfil all thy
        counsel.

020:005 We will rejoice in thy salvation, and in the name of our God
        we will set up our banners: the LORD fulfil all thy petitions.

020:006 Now know I that the LORD saveth his anointed; he will hear him
        from his holy heaven with the saving strength of his right
        hand.

020:007 Some trust in chariots, and some in horses: but we will
        remember the name of the LORD our God.

020:008 They are brought down and fallen: but we are risen, and stand
        upright.

020:009 Save, LORD: let the king hear us when we call.

021:001 The king shall joy in thy strength, O LORD; and in thy
        salvation how greatly shall he rejoice!

021:002 Thou hast given him his heart's desire, and hast not
        withholden the request of his lips. Selah.

021:003 For thou preventest him with the blessings of goodness: thou
        settest a crown of pure gold on his head.

021:004 He asked life of thee, and thou gavest it him, even length of
        days for ever and ever.

021:005 His glory is great in thy salvation: honour and majesty hast
        thou laid upon him.

021:006 For thou hast made him most blessed for ever: thou hast made
        him exceeding glad with thy countenance.

021:007 For the king trusteth in the LORD, and through the mercy of
        the most High he shall not be moved.

021:008 Thine hand shall find out all thine enemies: thy right hand
        shall find out those that hate thee.

021:009 Thou shalt make them as a fiery oven in the time of thine
        anger: the LORD shall swallow them up in his wrath, and the
        fire shall devour them.

021:010 Their fruit shalt thou destroy from the earth, and their seed
        from among the children of men.

021:011 For they intended evil against thee: they imagined a
        mischievous device, which they are not able to perform.

021:012 Therefore shalt thou make them turn their back, when thou
        shalt make ready thine arrows upon thy strings against the
        face of them.

021:013 Be thou exalted, LORD, in thine own strength: so will we sing
        and praise thy power.

022:001 My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? why art thou so far
        from helping me, and from the words of my roaring?

022:002 O my God, I cry in the day time, but thou hearest not; and in
        the night season, and am not silent.

022:003 But thou art holy, O thou that inhabitest the praises of
        Israel.

022:004 Our fathers trusted in thee: they trusted, and thou didst
        deliver them.

022:005 They cried unto thee, and were delivered: they trusted in
        thee, and were not confounded.

022:006 But I am a worm, and no man; a reproach of men, and despised
        of the people.

022:007 All they that see me laugh me to scorn: they shoot out the
        lip, they shake the head, saying,

022:008 He trusted on the LORD that he would deliver him: let him
        deliver him, seeing he delighted in him.

022:009 But thou art he that took me out of the womb: thou didst make
        me hope when I was upon my mother's breasts.

022:010 I was cast upon thee from the womb: thou art my God from my
        mother's belly.

022:011 Be not far from me; for trouble is near; for there is none to
        help.

022:012 Many bulls have compassed me: strong bulls of Bashan have
        beset me round.

022:013 They gaped upon me with their mouths, as a ravening and a
        roaring lion.

022:014 I am poured out like water, and all my bones are out of joint:
        my heart is like wax; it is melted in the midst of my bowels.

022:015 My strength is dried up like a potsherd; and my tongue
        cleaveth to my jaws; and thou hast brought me into the dust of
        death.

022:016 For dogs have compassed me: the assembly of the wicked have
        inclosed me: they pierced my hands and my feet.

022:017 I may tell all my bones: they look and stare upon me.

022:018 They part my garments among them, and cast lots upon my
        vesture.

022:019 But be not thou far from me, O LORD: O my strength, haste thee
        to help me.

022:020 Deliver my soul from the sword; my darling from the power of
        the dog.

022:021 Save me from the lion's mouth: for thou hast heard me from the
        horns of the unicorns.

022:022 I will declare thy name unto my brethren: in the midst of the
        congregation will I praise thee.

022:023 Ye that fear the LORD, praise him; all ye the seed of Jacob,
        glorify him; and fear him, all ye the seed of Israel.

022:024 For he hath not despised nor abhorred the affliction of the
        afflicted; neither hath he hid his face from him; but when he
        cried unto him, he heard.

022:025 My praise shall be of thee in the great congregation: I will
        pay my vows before them that fear him.

022:026 The meek shall eat and be satisfied: they shall praise the
        LORD that seek him: your heart shall live for ever.

022:027 All the ends of the world shall remember and turn unto the
        LORD: and all the kindreds of the nations shall worship before
        thee.

022:028 For the kingdom is the LORD's: and he is the governor among
        the nations.

022:029 All they that be fat upon earth shall eat and worship: all
        they that go down to the dust shall bow before him: and none
        can keep alive his own soul.

022:030 A seed shall serve him; it shall be accounted to the Lord for
        a generation.

022:031 They shall come, and shall declare his righteousness unto a
        people that shall be born, that he hath done this.

023:001 The LORD is my shepherd; I shall not want.

023:002 He maketh me to lie down in green pastures: he leadeth me
        beside the still waters.

023:003 He restoreth my soul: he leadeth me in the paths of
        righteousness for his name's sake.

023:004 Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death,
        I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy
        staff they comfort me.

023:005 Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine
        enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over.

023:006 Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my
        life: and I will dwell in the house of the LORD for ever.

024:001 The earth is the LORD's, and the fulness thereof; the world,
        and they that dwell therein.

024:002 For he hath founded it upon the seas, and established it upon
        the floods.

024:003 Who shall ascend into the hill of the LORD? or who shall stand
        in his holy place?

024:004 He that hath clean hands, and a pure heart; who hath not
        lifted up his soul unto vanity, nor sworn deceitfully.

024:005 He shall receive the blessing from the LORD, and righteousness
        from the God of his salvation.

024:006 This is the generation of them that seek him, that seek thy
        face, O Jacob. Selah.

024:007 Lift up your heads, O ye gates; and be ye lift up, ye
        everlasting doors; and the King of glory shall come in.

024:008 Who is this King of glory? The LORD strong and mighty, the
        LORD mighty in battle.

024:009 Lift up your heads, O ye gates; even lift them up, ye
        everlasting doors; and the King of glory shall come in.

024:010 Who is this King of glory? The LORD of hosts, he is the King
        of glory. Selah.

025:001 Unto thee, O LORD, do I lift up my soul.

025:002 O my God, I trust in thee: let me not be ashamed, let not mine
        enemies triumph over me.

025:003 Yea, let none that wait on thee be ashamed: let them be
        ashamed which transgress without cause.

025:004 Shew me thy ways, O LORD; teach me thy paths.

025:005 Lead me in thy truth, and teach me: for thou art the God of my
        salvation; on thee do I wait all the day.

025:006 Remember, O LORD, thy tender mercies and thy lovingkindnesses;
        for they have been ever of old.

025:007 Remember not the sins of my youth, nor my transgressions:
        according to thy mercy remember thou me for thy goodness'
        sake, O LORD.

025:008 Good and upright is the LORD: therefore will he teach sinners
        in the way.

025:009 The meek will he guide in judgment: and the meek will he teach
        his way.

025:010 All the paths of the LORD are mercy and truth unto such as
        keep his covenant and his testimonies.

025:011 For thy name's sake, O LORD, pardon mine iniquity; for it is
        great.

025:012 What man is he that feareth the LORD? him shall he teach in
        the way that he shall choose.

025:013 His soul shall dwell at ease; and his seed shall inherit the
        earth.

025:014 The secret of the LORD is with them that fear him; and he will
        shew them his covenant.

025:015 Mine eyes are ever toward the LORD; for he shall pluck my feet
        out of the net.

025:016 Turn thee unto me, and have mercy upon me; for I am desolate
        and afflicted.

025:017 The troubles of my heart are enlarged: O bring thou me out of
        my distresses.

025:018 Look upon mine affliction and my pain; and forgive all my
        sins.

025:019 Consider mine enemies; for they are many; and they hate me
        with cruel hatred.

025:020 O keep my soul, and deliver me: let me not be ashamed; for I
        put my trust in thee.

025:021 Let integrity and uprightness preserve me; for I wait on thee.

025:022 Redeem Israel, O God, out of all his troubles.

026:001 Judge me, O LORD; for I have walked in mine integrity: I have
        trusted also in the LORD; therefore I shall not slide.

026:002 Examine me, O LORD, and prove me; try my reins and my heart.

026:003 For thy lovingkindness is before mine eyes: and I have walked
        in thy truth.

026:004 I have not sat with vain persons, neither will I go in with
        dissemblers.

026:005 I have hated the congregation of evil doers; and will not sit
        with the wicked.

026:006 I will wash mine hands in innocency: so will I compass thine
        altar, O LORD:

026:007 That I may publish with the voice of thanksgiving, and tell of
        all thy wondrous works.

026:008 LORD, I have loved the habitation of thy house, and the place
        where thine honour dwelleth.

026:009 Gather not my soul with sinners, nor my life with bloody men:

026:010 In whose hands is mischief, and their right hand is full of
        bribes.

026:011 But as for me, I will walk in mine integrity: redeem me, and
        be merciful unto me.

026:012 My foot standeth in an even place: in the congregations will I
        bless the LORD.

027:001 The LORD is my light and my salvation; whom shall I fear? the
        LORD is the strength of my life; of whom shall I be afraid?

027:002 When the wicked, even mine enemies and my foes, came upon me
        to eat up my flesh, they stumbled and fell.

027:003 Though an host should encamp against me, my heart shall not
        fear: though war should rise against me, in this will I be
        confident.

027:004 One thing have I desired of the LORD, that will I seek after;
        that I may dwell in the house of the LORD all the days of my
        life, to behold the beauty of the LORD, and to enquire in his
        temple.

027:005 For in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion:
        in the secret of his tabernacle shall he hide me; he shall set
        me up upon a rock.

027:006 And now shall mine head be lifted up above mine enemies round
        about me: therefore will I offer in his tabernacle sacrifices
        of joy; I will sing, yea, I will sing praises unto the LORD.

027:007 Hear, O LORD, when I cry with my voice: have mercy also upon
        me, and answer me.

027:008 When thou saidst, Seek ye my face; my heart said unto thee,
        Thy face, LORD, will I seek.

027:009 Hide not thy face far from me; put not thy servant away in
        anger: thou hast been my help; leave me not, neither forsake
        me, O God of my salvation.

027:010 When my father and my mother forsake me, then the LORD will
        take me up.

027:011 Teach me thy way, O LORD, and lead me in a plain path, because
        of mine enemies.

027:012 Deliver me not over unto the will of mine enemies: for false
        witnesses are risen up against me, and such as breathe out
        cruelty.

027:013 I had fainted, unless I had believed to see the goodness of
        the LORD in the land of the living.

027:014 Wait on the LORD: be of good courage, and he shall strengthen
        thine heart: wait, I say, on the LORD.

028:001 Unto thee will I cry, O LORD my rock; be not silent to me:
        lest, if thou be silent to me, I become like them that go down
        into the pit.

028:002 Hear the voice of my supplications, when I cry unto thee, when
        I lift up my hands toward thy holy oracle.

028:003 Draw me not away with the wicked, and with the workers of
        iniquity, which speak peace to their neighbours, but mischief
        is in their hearts.

028:004 Give them according to their deeds, and according to the
        wickedness of their endeavours: give them after the work of
        their hands; render to them their desert.

028:005 Because they regard not the works of the LORD, nor the
        operation of his hands, he shall destroy them, and not build
        them up.

028:006 Blessed be the LORD, because he hath heard the voice of my
        supplications.

028:007 The LORD is my strength and my shield; my heart trusted in
        him, and I am helped: therefore my heart greatly rejoiceth;
        and with my song will I praise him.

028:008 The LORD is their strength, and he is the saving strength of
        his anointed.

028:009 Save thy people, and bless thine inheritance: feed them also,
        and lift them up for ever.

029:001 Give unto the LORD, O ye mighty, give unto the LORD glory and
        strength.

029:002 Give unto the LORD the glory due unto his name; worship the
        LORD in the beauty of holiness.

029:003 The voice of the LORD is upon the waters: the God of glory
        thundereth: the LORD is upon many waters.

029:004 The voice of the LORD is powerful; the voice of the LORD is
        full of majesty.

029:005 The voice of the LORD breaketh the cedars; yea, the LORD
        breaketh the cedars of Lebanon.

029:006 He maketh them also to skip like a calf; Lebanon and Sirion
        like a young unicorn.

029:007 The voice of the LORD divideth the flames of fire.

029:008 The voice of the LORD shaketh the wilderness; the LORD shaketh
        the wilderness of Kadesh.

029:009 The voice of the LORD maketh the hinds to calve, and
        discovereth the forests: and in his temple doth every one
        speak of his glory.

029:010 The LORD sitteth upon the flood; yea, the LORD sitteth King
        for ever.

029:011 The LORD will give strength unto his people; the LORD will
        bless his people with peace.

030:001 I will extol thee, O LORD; for thou hast lifted me up, and
        hast not made my foes to rejoice over me.

030:002 O LORD my God, I cried unto thee, and thou hast healed me.

030:003 O LORD, thou hast brought up my soul from the grave: thou hast
        kept me alive, that I should not go down to the pit.

030:004 Sing unto the LORD, O ye saints of his, and give thanks at the
        remembrance of his holiness.

030:005 For his anger endureth but a moment; in his favour is life:
        weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning.

030:006 And in my prosperity I said, I shall never be moved.

030:007 LORD, by thy favour thou hast made my mountain to stand
        strong: thou didst hide thy face, and I was troubled.

030:008 I cried to thee, O LORD; and unto the LORD I made
        supplication.

030:009 What profit is there in my blood, when I go down to the pit?
        Shall the dust praise thee? shall it declare thy truth?

030:010 Hear, O LORD, and have mercy upon me: LORD, be thou my helper.

030:011 Thou hast turned for me my mourning into dancing: thou hast
        put off my sackcloth, and girded me with gladness;

030:012 To the end that my glory may sing praise to thee, and not be
        silent. O LORD my God, I will give thanks unto thee for ever.

031:001 In thee, O LORD, do I put my trust; let me never be ashamed:
        deliver me in thy righteousness.

031:002 Bow down thine ear to me; deliver me speedily: be thou my
        strong rock, for an house of defence to save me.

031:003 For thou art my rock and my fortress; therefore for thy name's
        sake lead me, and guide me.

031:004 Pull me out of the net that they have laid privily for me: for
        thou art my strength.

031:005 Into thine hand I commit my spirit: thou hast redeemed me, O
        LORD God of truth.

031:006 I have hated them that regard lying vanities: but I trust in
        the LORD.

031:007 I will be glad and rejoice in thy mercy: for thou hast
        considered my trouble; thou hast known my soul in adversities;

031:008 And hast not shut me up into the hand of the enemy: thou hast
        set my feet in a large room.

031:009 Have mercy upon me, O LORD, for I am in trouble: mine eye is
        consumed with grief, yea, my soul and my belly.

031:010 For my life is spent with grief, and my years with sighing: my
        strength faileth because of mine iniquity, and my bones are
        consumed.

031:011 I was a reproach among all mine enemies, but especially among
        my neighbours, and a fear to mine acquaintance: they that did
        see me without fled from me.

031:012 I am forgotten as a dead man out of mind: I am like a broken
        vessel.

031:013 For I have heard the slander of many: fear was on every side:
        while they took counsel together against me, they devised to
        take away my life.

031:014 But I trusted in thee, O LORD: I said, Thou art my God.

031:015 My times are in thy hand: deliver me from the hand of mine
        enemies, and from them that persecute me.

031:016 Make thy face to shine upon thy servant: save me for thy
        mercies' sake.

031:017 Let me not be ashamed, O LORD; for I have called upon thee:
        let the wicked be ashamed, and let them be silent in the
        grave.

031:018 Let the lying lips be put to silence; which speak grievous
        things proudly and contemptuously against the righteous.

031:019 Oh how great is thy goodness, which thou hast laid up for them
        that fear thee; which thou hast wrought for them that trust in
        thee before the sons of men!

031:020 Thou shalt hide them in the secret of thy presence from the
        pride of man: thou shalt keep them secretly in a pavilion from
        the strife of tongues.

031:021 Blessed be the LORD: for he hath shewed me his marvellous
        kindness in a strong city.

031:022 For I said in my haste, I am cut off from before thine eyes:
        nevertheless thou heardest the voice of my supplications when
        I cried unto thee.

031:023 O love the LORD, all ye his saints: for the LORD preserveth
        the faithful, and plentifully rewardeth the proud doer.

031:024 Be of good courage, and he shall strengthen your heart, all ye
        that hope in the LORD.

032:001 Blessed is he whose transgression is forgiven, whose sin is
        covered.

032:002 Blessed is the man unto whom the LORD imputeth not iniquity,
        and in whose spirit there is no guile.

032:003 When I kept silence, my bones waxed old through my roaring all
        the day long.

032:004 For day and night thy hand was heavy upon me: my moisture is
        turned into the drought of summer. Selah.

032:005 I acknowledge my sin unto thee, and mine iniquity have I not
        hid. I said, I will confess my transgressions unto the LORD;
        and thou forgavest the iniquity of my sin. Selah.

032:006 For this shall every one that is godly pray unto thee in a
        time when thou mayest be found: surely in the floods of great
        waters they shall not come nigh unto him.

032:007 Thou art my hiding place; thou shalt preserve me from trouble;
        thou shalt compass me about with songs of deliverance. Selah.

032:008 I will instruct thee and teach thee in the way which thou
        shalt go: I will guide thee with mine eye.

032:009 Be ye not as the horse, or as the mule, which have no
        understanding: whose mouth must be held in with bit and
        bridle, lest they come near unto thee.

032:010 Many sorrows shall be to the wicked: but he that trusteth in
        the LORD, mercy shall compass him about.

032:011 Be glad in the LORD, and rejoice, ye righteous: and shout for
        joy, all ye that are upright in heart.

033:001 Rejoice in the LORD, O ye righteous: for praise is comely for
        the upright.

033:002 Praise the LORD with harp: sing unto him with the psaltery and
        an instrument of ten strings.

033:003 Sing unto him a new song; play skilfully with a loud noise.

033:004 For the word of the LORD is right; and all his works are done
        in truth.

033:005 He loveth righteousness and judgment: the earth is full of the
        goodness of the LORD.

033:006 By the word of the LORD were the heavens made; and all the
        host of them by the breath of his mouth.

033:007 He gathereth the waters of the sea together as an heap: he
        layeth up the depth in storehouses.

033:008 Let all the earth fear the LORD: let all the inhabitants of
        the world stand in awe of him.

033:009 For he spake, and it was done; he commanded, and it stood
        fast.

033:010 The LORD bringeth the counsel of the heathen to nought: he
        maketh the devices of the people of none effect.

033:011 The counsel of the LORD standeth for ever, the thoughts of his
        heart to all generations.

033:012 Blessed is the nation whose God is the LORD; and the people
        whom he hath chosen for his own inheritance.

033:013 The LORD looketh from heaven; he beholdeth all the sons of
        men.

033:014 From the place of his habitation he looketh upon all the
        inhabitants of the earth.

033:015 He fashioneth their hearts alike; he considereth all their
        works.

033:016 There is no king saved by the multitude of an host: a mighty
        man is not delivered by much strength.

033:017 An horse is a vain thing for safety: neither shall he deliver
        any by his great strength.

033:018 Behold, the eye of the LORD is upon them that fear him, upon
        them that hope in his mercy;

033:019 To deliver their soul from death, and to keep them alive in
        famine.

033:020 Our soul waiteth for the LORD: he is our help and our shield.

033:021 For our heart shall rejoice in him, because we have trusted in
        his holy name.

033:022 Let thy mercy, O LORD, be upon us, according as we hope in
        thee.

034:001 I will bless the LORD at all times: his praise shall
        continually be in my mouth.

034:002 My soul shall make her boast in the LORD: the humble shall
        hear thereof, and be glad.

034:003 O magnify the LORD with me, and let us exalt his name
        together.

034:004 I sought the LORD, and he heard me, and delivered me from all
        my fears.

034:005 They looked unto him, and were lightened: and their faces were
        not ashamed.

034:006 This poor man cried, and the LORD heard him, and saved him out
        of all his troubles.

034:007 The angel of the LORD encampeth round about them that fear
        him, and delivereth them.

034:008 O taste and see that the LORD is good: blessed is the man that
        trusteth in him.

034:009 O fear the LORD, ye his saints: for there is no want to them
        that fear him.

034:010 The young lions do lack, and suffer hunger: but they that seek
        the LORD shall not want any good thing.

034:011 Come, ye children, hearken unto me: I will teach you the fear
        of the LORD.

034:012 What man is he that desireth life, and loveth many days, that
        he may see good?

034:013 Keep thy tongue from evil, and thy lips from speaking guile.

034:014 Depart from evil, and do good; seek peace, and pursue it.

034:015 The eyes of the LORD are upon the righteous, and his ears are
        open unto their cry.

034:016 The face of the LORD is against them that do evil, to cut off
        the remembrance of them from the earth.

034:017 The righteous cry, and the LORD heareth, and delivereth them
        out of all their troubles.

034:018 The LORD is nigh unto them that are of a broken heart; and
        saveth such as be of a contrite spirit.

034:019 Many are the afflictions of the righteous: but the LORD
        delivereth him out of them all.

034:020 He keepeth all his bones: not one of them is broken.

034:021 Evil shall slay the wicked: and they that hate the righteous
        shall be desolate.

034:022 The LORD redeemeth the soul of his servants: and none of them
        that trust in him shall be desolate.

035:001 Plead my cause, O LORD, with them that strive with me: fight
        against them that fight against me.

035:002 Take hold of shield and buckler, and stand up for mine help.

035:003 Draw out also the spear, and stop the way against them that
        persecute me: say unto my soul, I am thy salvation.

035:004 Let them be confounded and put to shame that seek after my
        soul: let them be turned back and brought to confusion that
        devise my hurt.

035:005 Let them be as chaff before the wind: and let the angel of the
        LORD chase them.

035:006 Let their way be dark and slippery: and let the angel of the
        LORD persecute them.

035:007 For without cause have they hid for me their net in a pit,
        which without cause they have digged for my soul.

035:008 Let destruction come upon him at unawares; and let his net
        that he hath hid catch himself: into that very destruction let
        him fall.

035:009 And my soul shall be joyful in the LORD: it shall rejoice in
        his salvation.

035:010 All my bones shall say, LORD, who is like unto thee, which
        deliverest the poor from him that is too strong for him, yea,
        the poor and the needy from him that spoileth him?

035:011 False witnesses did rise up; they laid to my charge things
        that I knew not.

035:012 They rewarded me evil for good to the spoiling of my soul.

035:013 But as for me, when they were sick, my clothing was sackcloth:
        I humbled my soul with fasting; and my prayer returned into
        mine own bosom.

035:014 I behaved myself as though he had been my friend or brother: I
        bowed down heavily, as one that mourneth for his mother.

035:015 But in mine adversity they rejoiced, and gathered themselves
        together: yea, the abjects gathered themselves together
        against me, and I knew it not; they did tear me, and ceased
        not:

035:016 With hypocritical mockers in feasts, they gnashed upon me with
        their teeth.

035:017 Lord, how long wilt thou look on? rescue my soul from their
        destructions, my darling from the lions.

035:018 I will give thee thanks in the great congregation: I will
        praise thee among much people.

035:019 Let not them that are mine enemies wrongfully rejoice over me:
        neither let them wink with the eye that hate me without a
        cause.

035:020 For they speak not peace: but they devise deceitful matters
        against them that are quiet in the land.

035:021 Yea, they opened their mouth wide against me, and said, Aha,
        aha, our eye hath seen it.

035:022 This thou hast seen, O LORD: keep not silence: O Lord, be not
        far from me.

035:023 Stir up thyself, and awake to my judgment, even unto my cause,
        my God and my Lord.

035:024 Judge me, O LORD my God, according to thy righteousness; and
        let them not rejoice over me.

035:025 Let them not say in their hearts, Ah, so would we have it: let
        them not say, We have swallowed him up.

035:026 Let them be ashamed and brought to confusion together that
        rejoice at mine hurt: let them be clothed with shame and
        dishonour that magnify themselves against me.

035:027 Let them shout for joy, and be glad, that favour my righteous
        cause: yea, let them say continually, Let the LORD be
        magnified, which hath pleasure in the prosperity of his
        servant.

035:028 And my tongue shall speak of thy righteousness and of thy
        praise all the day long.

036:001 The transgression of the wicked saith within my heart, that
        there is no fear of God before his eyes.

036:002 For he flattereth himself in his own eyes, until his iniquity
        be found to be hateful.

036:003 The words of his mouth are iniquity and deceit: he hath left
        off to be wise, and to do good.

036:004 He deviseth mischief upon his bed; he setteth himself in a way
        that is not good; he abhorreth not evil.

036:005 Thy mercy, O LORD, is in the heavens; and thy faithfulness
        reacheth unto the clouds.

036:006 Thy righteousness is like the great mountains; thy judgments
        are a great deep: O LORD, thou preservest man and beast.

036:007 How excellent is thy lovingkindness, O God! therefore the
        children of men put their trust under the shadow of thy wings.

036:008 They shall be abundantly satisfied with the fatness of thy
        house; and thou shalt make them drink of the river of thy
        pleasures.

036:009 For with thee is the fountain of life: in thy light shall we
        see light.

036:010 O continue thy lovingkindness unto them that know thee; and
        thy righteousness to the upright in heart.

036:011 Let not the foot of pride come against me, and let not the
        hand of the wicked remove me.

036:012 There are the workers of iniquity fallen: they are cast down,
        and shall not be able to rise.

037:001 Fret not thyself because of evildoers, neither be thou envious
        against the workers of iniquity.

037:002 For they shall soon be cut down like the grass, and wither as
        the green herb.

037:003 Trust in the LORD, and do good; so shalt thou dwell in the
        land, and verily thou shalt be fed.

037:004 Delight thyself also in the LORD: and he shall give thee the
        desires of thine heart.

037:005 Commit thy way unto the LORD; trust also in him; and he shall
        bring it to pass.

037:006 And he shall bring forth thy righteousness as the light, and
        thy judgment as the noonday.

037:007 Rest in the LORD, and wait patiently for him: fret not thyself
        because of him who prospereth in his way, because of the man
        who bringeth wicked devices to pass.

037:008 Cease from anger, and forsake wrath: fret not thyself in any
        wise to do evil.

037:009 For evildoers shall be cut off: but those that wait upon the
        LORD, they shall inherit the earth.

037:010 For yet a little while, and the wicked shall not be: yea, thou
        shalt diligently consider his place, and it shall not be.

037:011 But the meek shall inherit the earth; and shall delight
        themselves in the abundance of peace.

037:012 The wicked plotteth against the just, and gnasheth upon him
        with his teeth.

037:013 The LORD shall laugh at him: for he seeth that his day is
        coming.

037:014 The wicked have drawn out the sword, and have bent their bow,
        to cast down the poor and needy, and to slay such as be of
        upright conversation.

037:015 Their sword shall enter into their own heart, and their bows
        shall be broken.

037:016 A little that a righteous man hath is better than the riches
        of many wicked.

037:017 For the arms of the wicked shall be broken: but the LORD
        upholdeth the righteous.

037:018 The LORD knoweth the days of the upright: and their
        inheritance shall be for ever.

037:019 They shall not be ashamed in the evil time: and in the days of
        famine they shall be satisfied.

037:020 But the wicked shall perish, and the enemies of the LORD shall
        be as the fat of lambs: they shall consume; into smoke shall
        they consume away.

037:021 The wicked borroweth, and payeth not again: but the righteous
        sheweth mercy, and giveth.

037:022 For such as be blessed of him shall inherit the earth; and
        they that be cursed of him shall be cut off.

037:023 The steps of a good man are ordered by the LORD: and he
        delighteth in his way.

037:024 Though he fall, he shall not be utterly cast down: for the
        LORD upholdeth him with his hand.

037:025 I have been young, and now am old; yet have I not seen the
        righteous forsaken, nor his seed begging bread.

037:026 He is ever merciful, and lendeth; and his seed is blessed.

037:027 Depart from evil, and do good; and dwell for evermore.

037:028 For the LORD loveth judgment, and forsaketh not his saints;
        they are preserved for ever: but the seed of the wicked shall
        be cut off.

037:029 The righteous shall inherit the land, and dwell therein for
        ever.

037:030 The mouth of the righteous speaketh wisdom, and his tongue
        talketh of judgment.

037:031 The law of his God is in his heart; none of his steps shall
        slide.

037:032 The wicked watcheth the righteous, and seeketh to slay him.

037:033 The LORD will not leave him in his hand, nor condemn him when
        he is judged.

037:034 Wait on the LORD, and keep his way, and he shall exalt thee to
        inherit the land: when the wicked are cut off, thou shalt see
        it.

037:035 I have seen the wicked in great power, and spreading himself
        like a green bay tree.

037:036 Yet he passed away, and, lo, he was not: yea, I sought him,
        but he could not be found.

037:037 Mark the perfect man, and behold the upright: for the end of
        that man is peace.

037:038 But the transgressors shall be destroyed together: the end of
        the wicked shall be cut off.

037:039 But the salvation of the righteous is of the LORD: he is their
        strength in the time of trouble.

037:040 And the LORD shall help them, and deliver them: he shall
        deliver them from the wicked, and save them, because they
        trust in him.

038:001 O lord, rebuke me not in thy wrath: neither chasten me in thy
        hot displeasure.

038:002 For thine arrows stick fast in me, and thy hand presseth me
        sore.

038:003 There is no soundness in my flesh because of thine anger;
        neither is there any rest in my bones because of my sin.

038:004 For mine iniquities are gone over mine head: as an heavy
        burden they are too heavy for me.

038:005 My wounds stink and are corrupt because of my foolishness.

038:006 I am troubled; I am bowed down greatly; I go mourning all the
        day long.

038:007 For my loins are filled with a loathsome disease: and there is
        no soundness in my flesh.

038:008 I am feeble and sore broken: I have roared by reason of the
        disquietness of my heart.

038:009 Lord, all my desire is before thee; and my groaning is not hid
        from thee.

038:010 My heart panteth, my strength faileth me: as for the light of
        mine eyes, it also is gone from me.

038:011 My lovers and my friends stand aloof from my sore; and my
        kinsmen stand afar off.

038:012 They also that seek after my life lay snares for me: and they
        that seek my hurt speak mischievous things, and imagine
        deceits all the day long.

038:013 But I, as a deaf man, heard not; and I was as a dumb man that
        openeth not his mouth.

038:014 Thus I was as a man that heareth not, and in whose mouth are
        no reproofs.

038:015 For in thee, O LORD, do I hope: thou wilt hear, O Lord my God.

038:016 For I said, Hear me, lest otherwise they should rejoice over
        me: when my foot slippeth, they magnify themselves against me.

038:017 For I am ready to halt, and my sorrow is continually before
        me.

038:018 For I will declare mine iniquity; I will be sorry for my sin.

038:019 But mine enemies are lively, and they are strong: and they
        that hate me wrongfully are multiplied.

038:020 They also that render evil for good are mine adversaries;
        because I follow the thing that good is.

038:021 Forsake me not, O LORD: O my God, be not far from me.

038:022 Make haste to help me, O Lord my salvation.

039:001 I said, I will take heed to my ways, that I sin not with my
        tongue: I will keep my mouth with a bridle, while the wicked
        is before me.

039:002 I was dumb with silence, I held my peace, even from good; and
        my sorrow was stirred.

039:003 My heart was hot within me, while I was musing the fire
        burned: then spake I with my tongue,

039:004 LORD, make me to know mine end, and the measure of my days,
        what it is: that I may know how frail I am.

039:005 Behold, thou hast made my days as an handbreadth; and mine age
        is as nothing before thee: verily every man at his best state
        is altogether vanity. Selah.

039:006 Surely every man walketh in a vain shew: surely they are
        disquieted in vain: he heapeth up riches, and knoweth not who
        shall gather them.

039:007 And now, Lord, what wait I for? my hope is in thee.

039:008 Deliver me from all my transgressions: make me not the
        reproach of the foolish.

039:009 I was dumb, I opened not my mouth; because thou didst it.

039:010 Remove thy stroke away from me: I am consumed by the blow of
        thine hand.

039:011 When thou with rebukes dost correct man for iniquity, thou
        makest his beauty to consume away like a moth: surely every
        man is vanity. Selah.

039:012 Hear my prayer, O LORD, and give ear unto my cry; hold not thy
        peace at my tears: for I am a stranger with thee, and a
        sojourner, as all my fathers were.

039:013 O spare me, that I may recover strength, before I go hence,
        and be no more.

040:001 I waited patiently for the LORD; and he inclined unto me, and
        heard my cry.

040:002 He brought me up also out of an horrible pit, out of the miry
        clay, and set my feet upon a rock, and established my goings.

040:003 And he hath put a new song in my mouth, even praise unto our
        God: many shall see it, and fear, and shall trust in the LORD.

040:004 Blessed is that man that maketh the LORD his trust, and
        respecteth not the proud, nor such as turn aside to lies.

040:005 Many, O LORD my God, are thy wonderful works which thou hast
        done, and thy thoughts which are to us-ward: they cannot be
        reckoned up in order unto thee: if I would declare and speak
        of them, they are more than can be numbered.

040:006 Sacrifice and offering thou didst not desire; mine ears hast
        thou opened: burnt offering and sin offering hast thou not
        required.

040:007 Then said I, Lo, I come: in the volume of the book it is
        written of me,

040:008 I delight to do thy will, O my God: yea, thy law is within my
        heart.

040:009 I have preached righteousness in the great congregation: lo, I
        have not refrained my lips, O LORD, thou knowest.

040:010 I have not hid thy righteousness within my heart; I have
        declared thy faithfulness and thy salvation: I have not
        concealed thy lovingkindness and thy truth from the great
        congregation.

040:011 Withhold not thou thy tender mercies from me, O LORD: let thy
        lovingkindness and thy truth continually preserve me.

040:012 For innumerable evils have compassed me about: mine iniquities
        have taken hold upon me, so that I am not able to look up;
        they are more than the hairs of mine head: therefore my heart
        faileth me.

040:013 Be pleased, O LORD, to deliver me: O LORD, make haste to help
        me.

040:014 Let them be ashamed and confounded together that seek after my
        soul to destroy it; let them be driven backward and put to
        shame that wish me evil.

040:015 Let them be desolate for a reward of their shame that say unto
        me, Aha, aha.

040:016 Let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee: let
        such as love thy salvation say continually, The LORD be
        magnified.

040:017 But I am poor and needy; yet the Lord thinketh upon me: thou
        art my help and my deliverer; make no tarrying, O my God.

041:001 Blessed is he that considereth the poor: the LORD will deliver
        him in time of trouble.

041:002 The LORD will preserve him, and keep him alive; and he shall
        be blessed upon the earth: and thou wilt not deliver him unto
        the will of his enemies.

041:003 The LORD will strengthen him upon the bed of languishing: thou
        wilt make all his bed in his sickness.

041:004 I said, LORD, be merciful unto me: heal my soul; for I have
        sinned against thee.

041:005 Mine enemies speak evil of me, When shall he die, and his name
        perish?

041:006 And if he come to see me, he speaketh vanity: his heart
        gathereth iniquity to itself; when he goeth abroad, he telleth
        it.

041:007 All that hate me whisper together against me: against me do
        they devise my hurt.

041:008 An evil disease, say they, cleaveth fast unto him: and now
        that he lieth he shall rise up no more.

041:009 Yea, mine own familiar friend, in whom I trusted, which did
        eat of my bread, hath lifted up his heel against me.

041:010 But thou, O LORD, be merciful unto me, and raise me up, that I
        may requite them.

041:011 By this I know that thou favourest me, because mine enemy doth
        not triumph over me.

041:012 And as for me, thou upholdest me in mine integrity, and
        settest me before thy face for ever.

041:013 Blessed be the LORD God of Israel from everlasting, and to
        everlasting. Amen, and Amen.

042:001 As the hart panteth after the water brooks, so panteth my soul
        after thee, O God.

042:002 My soul thirsteth for God, for the living God: when shall I
        come and appear before God?

042:003 My tears have been my meat day and night, while they
        continually say unto me, Where is thy God?

042:004 When I remember these things, I pour out my soul in me: for I
        had gone with the multitude, I went with them to the house of
        God, with the voice of joy and praise, with a multitude that
        kept holyday.

042:005 Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art thou disquieted
        in me? hope thou in God: for I shall yet praise him for the
        help of his countenance.

042:006 O my God, my soul is cast down within me: therefore will I
        remember thee from the land of Jordan, and of the Hermonites,
        from the hill Mizar.

042:007 Deep calleth unto deep at the noise of thy waterspouts: all
        thy waves and thy billows are gone over me.

042:008 Yet the LORD will command his lovingkindness in the day time,
        and in the night his song shall be with me, and my prayer unto
        the God of my life.

042:009 I will say unto God my rock, Why hast thou forgotten me? why
        go I mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?

042:010 As with a sword in my bones, mine enemies reproach me; while
        they say daily unto me, Where is thy God?

042:011 Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art thou disquieted
        within me? hope thou in God: for I shall yet praise him, who
        is the health of my countenance, and my God.

043:001 Judge me, O God, and plead my cause against an ungodly nation:
        O deliver me from the deceitful and unjust man.

043:002 For thou art the God of my strength: why dost thou cast me
        off? why go I mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?

043:003 O send out thy light and thy truth: let them lead me; let them
        bring me unto thy holy hill, and to thy tabernacles.

043:004 Then will I go unto the altar of God, unto God my exceeding
        joy: yea, upon the harp will I praise thee, O God my God.

043:005 Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art thou disquieted
        within me? hope in God: for I shall yet praise him, who is the
        health of my countenance, and my God.

044:001 We have heard with our ears, O God, our fathers have told us,
        what work thou didst in their days, in the times of old.

044:002 How thou didst drive out the heathen with thy hand, and
        plantedst them; how thou didst afflict the people, and cast
        them out.

044:003 For they got not the land in possession by their own sword,
        neither did their own arm save them: but thy right hand, and
        thine arm, and the light of thy countenance, because thou
        hadst a favour unto them.

044:004 Thou art my King, O God: command deliverances for Jacob.

044:005 Through thee will we push down our enemies: through thy name
        will we tread them under that rise up against us.

044:006 For I will not trust in my bow, neither shall my sword save
        me.

044:007 But thou hast saved us from our enemies, and hast put them to
        shame that hated us.

044:008 In God we boast all the day long, and praise thy name for
        ever. Selah.

044:009 But thou hast cast off, and put us to shame; and goest not
        forth with our armies.

044:010 Thou makest us to turn back from the enemy: and they which
        hate us spoil for themselves.

044:011 Thou hast given us like sheep appointed for meat; and hast
        scattered us among the heathen.

044:012 Thou sellest thy people for nought, and dost not increase thy
        wealth by their price.

044:013 Thou makest us a reproach to our neighbours, a scorn and a
        derision to them that are round about us.

044:014 Thou makest us a byword among the heathen, a shaking of the
        head among the people.

044:015 My confusion is continually before me, and the shame of my
        face hath covered me,

044:016 For the voice of him that reproacheth and blasphemeth; by
        reason of the enemy and avenger.

044:017 All this is come upon us; yet have we not forgotten thee,
        neither have we dealt falsely in thy covenant.

044:018 Our heart is not turned back, neither have our steps declined
        from thy way;

044:019 Though thou hast sore broken us in the place of dragons, and
        covered us with the shadow of death.

044:020 If we have forgotten the name of our God, or stretched out our
        hands to a strange god;

044:021 Shall not God search this out? for he knoweth the secrets of
        the heart.

044:022 Yea, for thy sake are we killed all the day long; we are
        counted as sheep for the slaughter.

044:023 Awake, why sleepest thou, O Lord? arise, cast us not off for
        ever.

044:024 Wherefore hidest thou thy face, and forgettest our affliction
        and our oppression?

044:025 For our soul is bowed down to the dust: our belly cleaveth
        unto the earth.

044:026 Arise for our help, and redeem us for thy mercies' sake.

045:001 My heart is inditing a good matter: I speak of the things
        which I have made touching the king: my tongue is the pen of a
        ready writer.

045:002 Thou art fairer than the children of men: grace is poured into
        thy lips: therefore God hath blessed thee for ever.

045:003 Gird thy sword upon thy thigh, O most mighty, with thy glory
        and thy majesty.

045:004 And in thy majesty ride prosperously because of truth and
        meekness and righteousness; and thy right hand shall teach
        thee terrible things.

045:005 Thine arrows are sharp in the heart of the king's enemies;
        whereby the people fall under thee.

045:006 Thy throne, O God, is for ever and ever: the sceptre of thy
        kingdom is a right sceptre.

045:007 Thou lovest righteousness, and hatest wickedness: therefore
        God, thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness
        above thy fellows.

045:008 All thy garments smell of myrrh, and aloes, and cassia, out of
        the ivory palaces, whereby they have made thee glad.

045:009 Kings' daughters were among thy honourable women: upon thy
        right hand did stand the queen in gold of Ophir.

045:010 Hearken, O daughter, and consider, and incline thine ear;
        forget also thine own people, and thy father's house;

045:011 So shall the king greatly desire thy beauty: for he is thy
        Lord; and worship thou him.

045:012 And the daughter of Tyre shall be there with a gift; even the
        rich among the people shall intreat thy favour.

045:013 The king's daughter is all glorious within: her clothing is of
        wrought gold.

045:014 She shall be brought unto the king in raiment of needlework:
        the virgins her companions that follow her shall be brought
        unto thee.

045:015 With gladness and rejoicing shall they be brought: they shall
        enter into the king's palace.

045:016 Instead of thy fathers shall be thy children, whom thou mayest
        make princes in all the earth.

045:017 I will make thy name to be remembered in all generations:
        therefore shall the people praise thee for ever and ever.

046:001 God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in
        trouble.

046:002 Therefore will not we fear, though the earth be removed, and
        though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea;

046:003 Though the waters thereof roar and be troubled, though the
        mountains shake with the swelling thereof. Selah.

046:004 There is a river, the streams whereof shall make glad the city
        of God, the holy place of the tabernacles of the most High.

046:005 God is in the midst of her; she shall not be moved: God shall
        help her, and that right early.

046:006 The heathen raged, the kingdoms were moved: he uttered his
        voice, the earth melted.

046:007 The LORD of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our refuge.
        Selah.

046:008 Come, behold the works of the LORD, what desolations he hath
        made in the earth.

046:009 He maketh wars to cease unto the end of the earth; he breaketh
        the bow, and cutteth the spear in sunder; he burneth the
        chariot in the fire.

046:010 Be still, and know that I am God: I will be exalted among the
        heathen, I will be exalted in the earth.

046:011 The LORD of hosts is with us; the God of Jacob is our refuge.
        Selah.

047:001 O clap your hands, all ye people; shout unto God with the
        voice of triumph.

047:002 For the LORD most high is terrible; he is a great King over
        all the earth.

047:003 He shall subdue the people under us, and the nations under our
        feet.

047:004 He shall choose our inheritance for us, the excellency of
        Jacob whom he loved. Selah.

047:005 God is gone up with a shout, the LORD with the sound of a
        trumpet.

047:006 Sing praises to God, sing praises: sing praises unto our King,
        sing praises.

047:007 For God is the King of all the earth: sing ye praises with
        understanding.

047:008 God reigneth over the heathen: God sitteth upon the throne of
        his holiness.

047:009 The princes of the people are gathered together, even the
        people of the God of Abraham: for the shields of the earth
        belong unto God: he is greatly exalted.

048:001 Great is the LORD, and greatly to be praised in the city of
        our God, in the mountain of his holiness.

048:002 Beautiful for situation, the joy of the whole earth, is mount
        Zion, on the sides of the north, the city of the great King.

048:003 God is known in her palaces for a refuge.

048:004 For, lo, the kings were assembled, they passed by together.

048:005 They saw it, and so they marvelled; they were troubled, and
        hasted away.

048:006 Fear took hold upon them there, and pain, as of a woman in
        travail.

048:007 Thou breakest the ships of Tarshish with an east wind.

048:008 As we have heard, so have we seen in the city of the LORD of
        hosts, in the city of our God: God will establish it for ever.
        Selah.

048:009 We have thought of thy lovingkindness, O God, in the midst of
        thy temple.

048:010 According to thy name, O God, so is thy praise unto the ends
        of the earth: thy right hand is full of righteousness.

048:011 Let mount Zion rejoice, let the daughters of Judah be glad,
        because of thy judgments.

048:012 Walk about Zion, and go round about her: tell the towers
        thereof.

048:013 Mark ye well her bulwarks, consider her palaces; that ye may
        tell it to the generation following.

048:014 For this God is our God for ever and ever: he will be our
        guide even unto death.

049:001 Hear this, all ye people; give ear, all ye inhabitants of the
        world:

049:002 Both low and high, rich and poor, together.

049:003 My mouth shall speak of wisdom; and the meditation of my heart
        shall be of understanding.

049:004 I will incline mine ear to a parable: I will open my dark
        saying upon the harp.

049:005 Wherefore should I fear in the days of evil, when the iniquity
        of my heels shall compass me about?

049:006 They that trust in their wealth, and boast themselves in the
        multitude of their riches;

049:007 None of them can by any means redeem his brother, nor give to
        God a ransom for him:

049:008 (For the redemption of their soul is precious, and it ceaseth
        for ever:)

049:009 That he should still live for ever, and not see corruption.

049:010 For he seeth that wise men die, likewise the fool and the
        brutish person perish, and leave their wealth to others.

049:011 Their inward thought is, that their houses shall continue for
        ever, and their dwelling places to all generations; they call
        their lands after their own names.

049:012 Nevertheless man being in honour abideth not: he is like the
        beasts that perish.

049:013 This their way is their folly: yet their posterity approve
        their sayings. Selah.

049:014 Like sheep they are laid in the grave; death shall feed on
        them; and the upright shall have dominion over them in the
        morning; and their beauty shall consume in the grave from
        their dwelling.

049:015 But God will redeem my soul from the power of the grave: for
        he shall receive me. Selah.

049:016 Be not thou afraid when one is made rich, when the glory of
        his house is increased;

049:017 For when he dieth he shall carry nothing away: his glory shall
        not descend after him.

049:018 Though while he lived he blessed his soul: and men will praise
        thee, when thou doest well to thyself.

049:019 He shall go to the generation of his fathers; they shall never
        see light.

049:020 Man that is in honour, and understandeth not, is like the
        beasts that perish.

050:001 The mighty God, even the LORD, hath spoken, and called the
        earth from the rising of the sun unto the going down thereof.

050:002 Out of Zion, the perfection of beauty, God hath shined.

050:003 Our God shall come, and shall not keep silence: a fire shall
        devour before him, and it shall be very tempestuous round
        about him.

050:004 He shall call to the heavens from above, and to the earth,
        that he may judge his people.

050:005 Gather my saints together unto me; those that have made a
        covenant with me by sacrifice.

050:006 And the heavens shall declare his righteousness: for God is
        judge himself. Selah.

050:007 Hear, O my people, and I will speak; O Israel, and I will
        testify against thee: I am God, even thy God.

050:008 I will not reprove thee for thy sacrifices or thy burnt
        offerings, to have been continually before me.

050:009 I will take no bullock out of thy house, nor he goats out of
        thy folds.

050:010 For every beast of the forest is mine, and the cattle upon a
        thousand hills.

050:011 I know all the fowls of the mountains: and the wild beasts of
        the field are mine.

050:012 If I were hungry, I would not tell thee: for the world is
        mine, and the fulness thereof.

050:013 Will I eat the flesh of bulls, or drink the blood of goats?

050:014 Offer unto God thanksgiving; and pay thy vows unto the most
        High:

050:015 And call upon me in the day of trouble: I will deliver thee,
        and thou shalt glorify me.

050:016 But unto the wicked God saith, What hast thou to do to declare
        my statutes, or that thou shouldest take my covenant in thy
        mouth?

050:017 Seeing thou hatest instruction, and casteth my words behind
        thee.

050:018 When thou sawest a thief, then thou consentedst with him, and
        hast been partaker with adulterers.

050:019 Thou givest thy mouth to evil, and thy tongue frameth deceit.

050:020 Thou sittest and speakest against thy brother; thou slanderest
        thine own mother's son.

050:021 These things hast thou done, and I kept silence; thou
        thoughtest that I was altogether such an one as thyself: but I
        will reprove thee, and set them in order before thine eyes.

050:022 Now consider this, ye that forget God, lest I tear you in
        pieces, and there be none to deliver.

050:023 Whoso offereth praise glorifieth me: and to him that ordereth
        his conversation aright will I shew the salvation of God.

051:001 Have mercy upon me, O God, according to thy lovingkindness:
        according unto the multitude of thy tender mercies blot out my
        transgressions.

051:002 Wash me throughly from mine iniquity, and cleanse me from my
        sin.

051:003 For I acknowledge my transgressions: and my sin is ever before
        me.

051:004 Against thee, thee only, have I sinned, and done this evil in
        thy sight: that thou mightest be justified when thou speakest,
        and be clear when thou judgest.

051:005 Behold, I was shapen in iniquity; and in sin did my mother
        conceive me.

051:006 Behold, thou desirest truth in the inward parts: and in the
        hidden part thou shalt make me to know wisdom.

051:007 Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean: wash me, and I
        shall be whiter than snow.

051:008 Make me to hear joy and gladness; that the bones which thou
        hast broken may rejoice.

051:009 Hide thy face from my sins, and blot out all mine iniquities.

051:010 Create in me a clean heart, O God; and renew a right spirit
        within me.

051:011 Cast me not away from thy presence; and take not thy holy
        spirit from me.

051:012 Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation; and uphold me with
        thy free spirit.

051:013 Then will I teach transgressors thy ways; and sinners shall be
        converted unto thee.

051:014 Deliver me from bloodguiltiness, O God, thou God of my
        salvation: and my tongue shall sing aloud of thy
        righteousness.

051:015 O Lord, open thou my lips; and my mouth shall shew forth thy
        praise.

051:016 For thou desirest not sacrifice; else would I give it: thou
        delightest not in burnt offering.

051:017 The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit: a broken and a
        contrite heart, O God, thou wilt not despise.

051:018 Do good in thy good pleasure unto Zion: build thou the walls
        of Jerusalem.

051:019 Then shalt thou be pleased with the sacrifices of
        righteousness, with burnt offering and whole burnt offering:
        then shall they offer bullocks upon thine altar.

052:001 Why boastest thou thyself in mischief, O mighty man? the
        goodness of God endureth continually.

052:002 The tongue deviseth mischiefs; like a sharp razor, working
        deceitfully.

052:003 Thou lovest evil more than good; and lying rather than to
        speak righteousness. Selah.

052:004 Thou lovest all devouring words, O thou deceitful tongue.

052:005 God shall likewise destroy thee for ever, he shall take thee
        away, and pluck thee out of thy dwelling place, and root thee
        out of the land of the living. Selah.

052:006 The righteous also shall see, and fear, and shall laugh at
        him:

052:007 Lo, this is the man that made not God his strength; but
        trusted in the abundance of his riches, and strengthened
        himself in his wickedness.

052:008 But I am like a green olive tree in the house of God: I trust
        in the mercy of God for ever and ever.

052:009 I will praise thee for ever, because thou hast done it: and I
        will wait on thy name; for it is good before thy saints.

053:001 The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God. Corrupt are
        they, and have done abominable iniquity: there is none that
        doeth good.

053:002 God looked down from heaven upon the children of men, to see
        if there were any that did understand, that did seek God.

053:003 Every one of them is gone back: they are altogether become
        filthy; there is none that doeth good, no, not one.

053:004 Have the workers of iniquity no knowledge? who eat up my
        people as they eat bread: they have not called upon God.

053:005 There were they in great fear, where no fear was: for God hath
        scattered the bones of him that encampeth against thee: thou
        hast put them to shame, because God hath despised them.

053:006 Oh that the salvation of Israel were come out of Zion! When
        God bringeth back the captivity of his people, Jacob shall
        rejoice, and Israel shall be glad.

054:001 Save me, O God, by thy name, and judge me by thy strength.

054:002 Hear my prayer, O God; give ear to the words of my mouth.

054:003 For strangers are risen up against me, and oppressors seek
        after my soul: they have not set God before them. Selah.

054:004 Behold, God is mine helper: the Lord is with them that uphold
        my soul.

054:005 He shall reward evil unto mine enemies: cut them off in thy
        truth.

054:006 I will freely sacrifice unto thee: I will praise thy name, O
        LORD; for it is good.

054:007 For he hath delivered me out of all trouble: and mine eye hath
        seen his desire upon mine enemies.

055:001 Give ear to my prayer, O God; and hide not thyself from my
        supplication.

055:002 Attend unto me, and hear me: I mourn in my complaint, and make
        a noise;

055:003 Because of the voice of the enemy, because of the oppression
        of the wicked: for they cast iniquity upon me, and in wrath
        they hate me.

055:004 My heart is sore pained within me: and the terrors of death
        are fallen upon me.

055:005 Fearfulness and trembling are come upon me, and horror hath
        overwhelmed me.

055:006 And I said, Oh that I had wings like a dove! for then would I
        fly away, and be at rest.

055:007 Lo, then would I wander far off, and remain in the wilderness.
        Selah.

055:008 I would hasten my escape from the windy storm and tempest.

055:009 Destroy, O Lord, and divide their tongues: for I have seen
        violence and strife in the city.

055:010 Day and night they go about it upon the walls thereof:
        mischief also and sorrow are in the midst of it.

055:011 Wickedness is in the midst thereof: deceit and guile depart
        not from her streets.

055:012 For it was not an enemy that reproached me; then I could have
        borne it: neither was it he that hated me that did magnify
        himself against me; then I would have hid myself from him:

055:013 But it was thou, a man mine equal, my guide, and mine
        acquaintance.

055:014 We took sweet counsel together, and walked unto the house of
        God in company.

055:015 Let death seize upon them, and let them go down quick into
        hell: for wickedness is in their dwellings, and among them.

055:016 As for me, I will call upon God; and the LORD shall save me.

055:017 Evening, and morning, and at noon, will I pray, and cry aloud:
        and he shall hear my voice.

055:018 He hath delivered my soul in peace from the battle that was
        against me: for there were many with me.

055:019 God shall hear, and afflict them, even he that abideth of old.
        Selah. Because they have no changes, therefore they fear not
        God.

055:020 He hath put forth his hands against such as be at peace with
        him: he hath broken his covenant.

055:021 The words of his mouth were smoother than butter, but war was
        in his heart: his words were softer than oil, yet were they
        drawn swords.

055:022 Cast thy burden upon the LORD, and he shall sustain thee: he
        shall never suffer the righteous to be moved.

055:023 But thou, O God, shalt bring them down into the pit of
        destruction: bloody and deceitful men shall not live out half
        their days; but I will trust in thee.

056:001 Be merciful unto me, O God: for man would swallow me up; he
        fighting daily oppresseth me.

056:002 Mine enemies would daily swallow me up: for they be many that
        fight against me, O thou most High.

056:003 What time I am afraid, I will trust in thee.

056:004 In God I will praise his word, in God I have put my trust; I
        will not fear what flesh can do unto me.

056:005 Every day they wrest my words: all their thoughts are against
        me for evil.

056:006 They gather themselves together, they hide themselves, they
        mark my steps, when they wait for my soul.

056:007 Shall they escape by iniquity? in thine anger cast down the
        people, O God.

056:008 Thou tellest my wanderings: put thou my tears into thy bottle:
        are they not in thy book?

056:009 When I cry unto thee, then shall mine enemies turn back: this
        I know; for God is for me.

056:010 In God will I praise his word: in the LORD will I praise his
        word.

056:011 In God have I put my trust: I will not be afraid what man can
        do unto me.

056:012 Thy vows are upon me, O God: I will render praises unto thee.

056:013 For thou hast delivered my soul from death: wilt not thou
        deliver my feet from falling, that I may walk before God in
        the light of the living?

057:001 Be merciful unto me, O God, be merciful unto me: for my soul
        trusteth in thee: yea, in the shadow of thy wings will I make
        my refuge, until these calamities be overpast.

057:002 I will cry unto God most high; unto God that performeth all
        things for me.

057:003 He shall send from heaven, and save me from the reproach of
        him that would swallow me up. Selah. God shall send forth his
        mercy and his truth.

057:004 My soul is among lions: and I lie even among them that are set
        on fire, even the sons of men, whose teeth are spears and
        arrows, and their tongue a sharp sword.

057:005 Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens; let thy glory be
        above all the earth.

057:006 They have prepared a net for my steps; my soul is bowed down:
        they have digged a pit before me, into the midst whereof they
        are fallen themselves. Selah.

057:007 My heart is fixed, O God, my heart is fixed: I will sing and
        give praise.

057:008 Awake up, my glory; awake, psaltery and harp: I myself will
        awake early.

057:009 I will praise thee, O Lord, among the people: I will sing unto
        thee among the nations.

057:010 For thy mercy is great unto the heavens, and thy truth unto
        the clouds.

057:011 Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens: let thy glory be
        above all the earth.

058:001 Do ye indeed speak righteousness, O congregation? do ye judge
        uprightly, O ye sons of men?

058:002 Yea, in heart ye work wickedness; ye weigh the violence of
        your hands in the earth.

058:003 The wicked are estranged from the womb: they go astray as soon
        as they be born, speaking lies.

058:004 Their poison is like the poison of a serpent: they are like
        the deaf adder that stoppeth her ear;

058:005 Which will not hearken to the voice of charmers, charming
        never so wisely.

058:006 Break their teeth, O God, in their mouth: break out the great
        teeth of the young lions, O LORD.

058:007 Let them melt away as waters which run continually: when he
        bendeth his bow to shoot his arrows, let them be as cut in
        pieces.

058:008 As a snail which melteth, let every one of them pass away:
        like the untimely birth of a woman, that they may not see the
        sun.

058:009 Before your pots can feel the thorns, he shall take them away
        as with a whirlwind, both living, and in his wrath.

058:010 The righteous shall rejoice when he seeth the vengeance: he
        shall wash his feet in the blood of the wicked.

058:011 So that a man shall say, Verily there is a reward for the
        righteous: verily he is a God that judgeth in the earth.

059:001 Deliver me from mine enemies, O my God: defend me from them
        that rise up against me.

059:002 Deliver me from the workers of iniquity, and save me from
        bloody men.

059:003 For, lo, they lie in wait for my soul: the mighty are gathered
        against me; not for my transgression, nor for my sin, O LORD.

059:004 They run and prepare themselves without my fault: awake to
        help me, and behold.

059:005 Thou therefore, O LORD God of hosts, the God of Israel, awake
        to visit all the heathen: be not merciful to any wicked
        transgressors. Selah.

059:006 They return at evening: they make a noise like a dog, and go
        round about the city.

059:007 Behold, they belch out with their mouth: swords are in their
        lips: for who, say they, doth hear?

059:008 But thou, O LORD, shalt laugh at them; thou shalt have all the
        heathen in derision.

059:009 Because of his strength will I wait upon thee: for God is my
        defence.

059:010 The God of my mercy shall prevent me: God shall let me see my
        desire upon mine enemies.

059:011 Slay them not, lest my people forget: scatter them by thy
        power; and bring them down, O Lord our shield.

059:012 For the sin of their mouth and the words of their lips let
        them even be taken in their pride: and for cursing and lying
        which they speak.

059:013 Consume them in wrath, consume them, that they may not be: and
        let them know that God ruleth in Jacob unto the ends of the
        earth. Selah.

059:014 And at evening let them return; and let them make a noise like
        a dog, and go round about the city.

059:015 Let them wander up and down for meat, and grudge if they be
        not satisfied.

059:016 But I will sing of thy power; yea, I will sing aloud of thy
        mercy in the morning: for thou hast been my defence and refuge
        in the day of my trouble.

059:017 Unto thee, O my strength, will I sing: for God is my defence,
        and the God of my mercy.

060:001 O God, thou hast cast us off, thou hast scattered us, thou
        hast been displeased; O turn thyself to us again.

060:002 Thou hast made the earth to tremble; thou hast broken it: heal
        the breaches thereof; for it shaketh.

060:003 Thou hast shewed thy people hard things: thou hast made us to
        drink the wine of astonishment.

060:004 Thou hast given a banner to them that fear thee, that it may
        be displayed because of the truth. Selah.

060:005 That thy beloved may be delivered; save with thy right hand,
        and hear me.

060:006 God hath spoken in his holiness; I will rejoice, I will divide
        Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth.

060:007 Gilead is mine, and Manasseh is mine; Ephraim also is the
        strength of mine head; Judah is my lawgiver;

060:008 Moab is my washpot; over Edom will I cast out my shoe:
        Philistia, triumph thou because of me.

060:009 Who will bring me into the strong city? who will lead me into
        Edom?

060:010 Wilt not thou, O God, which hadst cast us off? and thou, O
        God, which didst not go out with our armies?

060:011 Give us help from trouble: for vain is the help of man.

060:012 Through God we shall do valiantly: for he it is that shall
        tread down our enemies.

061:001 Hear my cry, O God; attend unto my prayer.

061:002 From the end of the earth will I cry unto thee, when my heart
        is overwhelmed: lead me to the rock that is higher than I.

061:003 For thou hast been a shelter for me, and a strong tower from
        the enemy.

061:004 I will abide in thy tabernacle for ever: I will trust in the
        covert of thy wings. Selah.

061:005 For thou, O God, hast heard my vows: thou hast given me the
        heritage of those that fear thy name.

061:006 Thou wilt prolong the king's life: and his years as many
        generations.

061:007 He shall abide before God for ever: O prepare mercy and truth,
        which may preserve him.

061:008 So will I sing praise unto thy name for ever, that I may daily
        perform my vows.

062:001 Truly my soul waiteth upon God: from him cometh my salvation.

062:002 He only is my rock and my salvation; he is my defence; I shall
        not be greatly moved.

062:003 How long will ye imagine mischief against a man? ye shall be
        slain all of you: as a bowing wall shall ye be, and as a
        tottering fence.

062:004 They only consult to cast him down from his excellency: they
        delight in lies: they bless with their mouth, but they curse
        inwardly. Selah.

062:005 My soul, wait thou only upon God; for my expectation is from
        him.

062:006 He only is my rock and my salvation: he is my defence; I shall
        not be moved.

062:007 In God is my salvation and my glory: the rock of my strength,
        and my refuge, is in God.

062:008 Trust in him at all times; ye people, pour out your heart
        before him: God is a refuge for us. Selah.

062:009 Surely men of low degree are vanity, and men of high degree
        are a lie: to be laid in the balance, they are altogether
        lighter than vanity.

062:010 Trust not in oppression, and become not vain in robbery: if
        riches increase, set not your heart upon them.

062:011 God hath spoken once; twice have I heard this; that power
        belongeth unto God.

062:012 Also unto thee, O Lord, belongeth mercy: for thou renderest to
        every man according to his work.

063:001 O God, thou art my God; early will I seek thee: my soul
        thirsteth for thee, my flesh longeth for thee in a dry and
        thirsty land, where no water is;

063:002 To see thy power and thy glory, so as I have seen thee in the
        sanctuary.

063:003 Because thy lovingkindness is better than life, my lips shall
        praise thee.

063:004 Thus will I bless thee while I live: I will lift up my hands
        in thy name.

063:005 My soul shall be satisfied as with marrow and fatness; and my
        mouth shall praise thee with joyful lips:

063:006 When I remember thee upon my bed, and meditate on thee in the
        night watches.

063:007 Because thou hast been my help, therefore in the shadow of thy
        wings will I rejoice.

063:008 My soul followeth hard after thee: thy right hand upholdeth
        me.

063:009 But those that seek my soul, to destroy it, shall go into the
        lower parts of the earth.

063:010 They shall fall by the sword: they shall be a portion for
        foxes.

063:011 But the king shall rejoice in God; every one that sweareth by
        him shall glory: but the mouth of them that speak lies shall
        be stopped.

064:001 Hear my voice, O God, in my prayer: preserve my life from fear
        of the enemy.

064:002 Hide me from the secret counsel of the wicked; from the
        insurrection of the workers of iniquity:

064:003 Who whet their tongue like a sword, and bend their bows to
        shoot their arrows, even bitter words:

064:004 That they may shoot in secret at the perfect: suddenly do they
        shoot at him, and fear not.

064:005 They encourage themselves in an evil matter: they commune of
        laying snares privily; they say, Who shall see them?

064:006 They search out iniquities; they accomplish a diligent search:
        both the inward thought of every one of them, and the heart,
        is deep.

064:007 But God shall shoot at them with an arrow; suddenly shall they
        be wounded.

064:008 So they shall make their own tongue to fall upon themselves:
        all that see them shall flee away.

064:009 And all men shall fear, and shall declare the work of God; for
        they shall wisely consider of his doing.

064:010 The righteous shall be glad in the LORD, and shall trust in
        him; and all the upright in heart shall glory.

065:001 Praise waiteth for thee, O God, in Sion: and unto thee shall
        the vow be performed.

065:002 O thou that hearest prayer, unto thee shall all flesh come.

065:003 Iniquities prevail against me: as for our transgressions, thou
        shalt purge them away.

065:004 Blessed is the man whom thou choosest, and causest to approach
        unto thee, that he may dwell in thy courts: we shall be
        satisfied with the goodness of thy house, even of thy holy
        temple.

065:005 By terrible things in righteousness wilt thou answer us, O God
        of our salvation; who art the confidence of all the ends of
        the earth, and of them that are afar off upon the sea:

065:006 Which by his strength setteth fast the mountains; being girded
        with power:

065:007 Which stilleth the noise of the seas, the noise of their
        waves, and the tumult of the people.

065:008 They also that dwell in the uttermost parts are afraid at thy
        tokens: thou makest the outgoings of the morning and evening
        to rejoice.

065:009 Thou visitest the earth, and waterest it: thou greatly
        enrichest it with the river of God, which is full of water:
        thou preparest them corn, when thou hast so provided for it.

065:010 Thou waterest the ridges thereof abundantly: thou settlest the
        furrows thereof: thou makest it soft with showers: thou
        blessest the springing thereof.

065:011 Thou crownest the year with thy goodness; and thy paths drop
        fatness.

065:012 They drop upon the pastures of the wilderness: and the little
        hills rejoice on every side.

065:013 The pastures are clothed with flocks; the valleys also are
        covered over with corn; they shout for joy, they also sing.

066:001 Make a joyful noise unto God, all ye lands:

066:002 Sing forth the honour of his name: make his praise glorious.

066:003 Say unto God, How terrible art thou in thy works! through the
        greatness of thy power shall thine enemies submit themselves
        unto thee.

066:004 All the earth shall worship thee, and shall sing unto thee;
        they shall sing to thy name. Selah.

066:005 Come and see the works of God: he is terrible in his doing
        toward the children of men.

066:006 He turned the sea into dry land: they went through the flood
        on foot: there did we rejoice in him.

066:007 He ruleth by his power for ever; his eyes behold the nations:
        let not the rebellious exalt themselves. Selah.

066:008 O bless our God, ye people, and make the voice of his praise
        to be heard:

066:009 Which holdeth our soul in life, and suffereth not our feet to
        be moved.

066:010 For thou, O God, hast proved us: thou hast tried us, as silver
        is tried.

066:011 Thou broughtest us into the net; thou laidst affliction upon
        our loins.

066:012 Thou hast caused men to ride over our heads; we went through
        fire and through water: but thou broughtest us out into a
        wealthy place.

066:013 I will go into thy house with burnt offerings: I will pay thee
        my vows,

066:014 Which my lips have uttered, and my mouth hath spoken, when I
        was in trouble.

066:015 I will offer unto thee burnt sacrifices of fatlings, with the
        incense of rams; I will offer bullocks with goats. Selah.

066:016 Come and hear, all ye that fear God, and I will declare what
        he hath done for my soul.

066:017 I cried unto him with my mouth, and he was extolled with my
        tongue.

066:018 If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear me:

066:019 But verily God hath heard me; he hath attended to the voice of
        my prayer.

066:020 Blessed be God, which hath not turned away my prayer, nor his
        mercy from me.

067:001 God be merciful unto us, and bless us; and cause his face to
        shine upon us; Selah.

067:002 That thy way may be known upon earth, thy saving health among
        all nations.

067:003 Let the people praise thee, O God; let all the people praise
        thee.

067:004 O let the nations be glad and sing for joy: for thou shalt
        judge the people righteously, and govern the nations upon
        earth. Selah.

067:005 Let the people praise thee, O God; let all the people praise
        thee.

067:006 Then shall the earth yield her increase; and God, even our own
        God, shall bless us.

067:007 God shall bless us; and all the ends of the earth shall fear
        him.

068:001 Let God arise, let his enemies be scattered: let them also
        that hate him flee before him.

068:002 As smoke is driven away, so drive them away: as wax melteth
        before the fire, so let the wicked perish at the presence of
        God.

068:003 But let the righteous be glad; let them rejoice before God:
        yea, let them exceedingly rejoice.

068:004 Sing unto God, sing praises to his name: extol him that rideth
        upon the heavens by his name JAH, and rejoice before him.

068:005 A father of the fatherless, and a judge of the widows, is God
        in his holy habitation.

068:006 God setteth the solitary in families: he bringeth out those
        which are bound with chains: but the rebellious dwell in a dry
        land.

068:007 O God, when thou wentest forth before thy people, when thou
        didst march through the wilderness; Selah:

068:008 The earth shook, the heavens also dropped at the presence of
        God: even Sinai itself was moved at the presence of God, the
        God of Israel.

068:009 Thou, O God, didst send a plentiful rain, whereby thou didst
        confirm thine inheritance, when it was weary.

068:010 Thy congregation hath dwelt therein: thou, O God, hast
        prepared of thy goodness for the poor.

068:011 The Lord gave the word: great was the company of those that
        published it.

068:012 Kings of armies did flee apace: and she that tarried at home
        divided the spoil.

068:013 Though ye have lien among the pots, yet shall ye be as the
        wings of a dove covered with silver, and her feathers with
        yellow gold.

068:014 When the Almighty scattered kings in it, it was white as snow
        in Salmon.

068:015 The hill of God is as the hill of Bashan; an high hill as the
        hill of Bashan.

068:016 Why leap ye, ye high hills? this is the hill which God
        desireth to dwell in; yea, the LORD will dwell in it for ever.

068:017 The chariots of God are twenty thousand, even thousands of
        angels: the Lord is among them, as in Sinai, in the holy
        place.

068:018 Thou hast ascended on high, thou hast led captivity captive:
        thou hast received gifts for men; yea, for the rebellious
        also, that the LORD God might dwell among them.

068:019 Blessed be the Lord, who daily loadeth us with benefits, even
        the God of our salvation. Selah.

068:020 He that is our God is the God of salvation; and unto GOD the
        Lord belong the issues from death.

068:021 But God shall wound the head of his enemies, and the hairy
        scalp of such an one as goeth on still in his trespasses.

068:022 The Lord said, I will bring again from Bashan, I will bring my
        people again from the depths of the sea:

068:023 That thy foot may be dipped in the blood of thine enemies, and
        the tongue of thy dogs in the same.

068:024 They have seen thy goings, O God; even the goings of my God,
        my King, in the sanctuary.

068:025 The singers went before, the players on instruments followed
        after; among them were the damsels playing with timbrels.

068:026 Bless ye God in the congregations, even the Lord, from the
        fountain of Israel.

068:027 There is little Benjamin with their ruler, the princes of
        Judah and their council, the princes of Zebulun, and the
        princes of Naphtali.

068:028 Thy God hath commanded thy strength: strengthen, O God, that
        which thou hast wrought for us.

068:029 Because of thy temple at Jerusalem shall kings bring presents
        unto thee.

068:030 Rebuke the company of spearmen, the multitude of the bulls,
        with the calves of the people, till every one submit himself
        with pieces of silver: scatter thou the people that delight in
        war.

068:031 Princes shall come out of Egypt; Ethiopia shall soon stretch
        out her hands unto God.

068:032 Sing unto God, ye kingdoms of the earth; O sing praises unto
        the Lord; Selah:

068:033 To him that rideth upon the heavens of heavens, which were of
        old; lo, he doth send out his voice, and that a mighty voice.

068:034 Ascribe ye strength unto God: his excellency is over Israel,
        and his strength is in the clouds.

068:035 O God, thou art terrible out of thy holy places: the God of
        Israel is he that giveth strength and power unto his people.
        Blessed be God.

069:001 Save me, O God; for the waters are come in unto my soul.

069:002 I sink in deep mire, where there is no standing: I am come
        into deep waters, where the floods overflow me.

069:003 I am weary of my crying: my throat is dried: mine eyes fail
        while I wait for my God.

069:004 They that hate me without a cause are more than the hairs of
        mine head: they that would destroy me, being mine enemies
        wrongfully, are mighty: then I restored that which I took not
        away.

069:005 O God, thou knowest my foolishness; and my sins are not hid
        from thee.

069:006 Let not them that wait on thee, O Lord GOD of hosts, be
        ashamed for my sake: let not those that seek thee be
        confounded for my sake, O God of Israel.

069:007 Because for thy sake I have borne reproach; shame hath covered
        my face.

069:008 I am become a stranger unto my brethren, and an alien unto my
        mother's children.

069:009 For the zeal of thine house hath eaten me up; and the
        reproaches of them that reproached thee are fallen upon me.

069:010 When I wept, and chastened my soul with fasting, that was to
        my reproach.

069:011 I made sackcloth also my garment; and I became a proverb to
        them.

069:012 They that sit in the gate speak against me; and I was the song
        of the drunkards.

069:013 But as for me, my prayer is unto thee, O LORD, in an
        acceptable time: O God, in the multitude of thy mercy hear me,
        in the truth of thy salvation.

069:014 Deliver me out of the mire, and let me not sink: let me be
        delivered from them that hate me, and out of the deep waters.

069:015 Let not the waterflood overflow me, neither let the deep
        swallow me up, and let not the pit shut her mouth upon me.

069:016 Hear me, O LORD; for thy lovingkindness is good: turn unto me
        according to the multitude of thy tender mercies.

069:017 And hide not thy face from thy servant; for I am in trouble:
        hear me speedily.

069:018 Draw nigh unto my soul, and redeem it: deliver me because of
        mine enemies.

069:019 Thou hast known my reproach, and my shame, and my dishonour:
        mine adversaries are all before thee.

069:020 Reproach hath broken my heart; and I am full of heaviness: and
        I looked for some to take pity, but there was none; and for
        comforters, but I found none.

069:021 They gave me also gall for my meat; and in my thirst they gave
        me vinegar to drink.

069:022 Let their table become a snare before them: and that which
        should have been for their welfare, let it become a trap.

069:023 Let their eyes be darkened, that they see not; and make their
        loins continually to shake.

069:024 Pour out thine indignation upon them, and let thy wrathful
        anger take hold of them.

069:025 Let their habitation be desolate; and let none dwell in their
        tents.

069:026 For they persecute him whom thou hast smitten; and they talk
        to the grief of those whom thou hast wounded.

069:027 Add iniquity unto their iniquity: and let them not come into
        thy righteousness.

069:028 Let them be blotted out of the book of the living, and not be
        written with the righteous.

069:029 But I am poor and sorrowful: let thy salvation, O God, set me
        up on high.

069:030 I will praise the name of God with a song, and will magnify
        him with thanksgiving.

069:031 This also shall please the LORD better than an ox or bullock
        that hath horns and hoofs.

069:032 The humble shall see this, and be glad: and your heart shall
        live that seek God.

069:033 For the LORD heareth the poor, and despiseth not his
        prisoners.

069:034 Let the heaven and earth praise him, the seas, and every thing
        that moveth therein.

069:035 For God will save Zion, and will build the cities of Judah:
        that they may dwell there, and have it in possession.

069:036 The seed also of his servants shall inherit it: and they that
        love his name shall dwell therein.

070:001 MAKE HASTE, O GOD, TO DELIVER ME; MAKE HASTE TO HELP ME, O
        LORD.

070:002 Let them be ashamed and confounded that seek after my soul:
        let them be turned backward, and put to confusion, that desire
        my hurt.

070:003 Let them be turned back for a reward of their shame that say,
        Aha, aha.

070:004 Let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee: and
        let such as love thy salvation say continually, Let God be
        magnified.

070:005 But I am poor and needy: make haste unto me, O God: thou art
        my help and my deliverer; O LORD, make no tarrying.

071:001 In thee, O LORD, do I put my trust: let me never be put to
        confusion.

071:002 Deliver me in thy righteousness, and cause me to escape:
        incline thine ear unto me, and save me.

071:003 Be thou my strong habitation, whereunto I may continually
        resort: thou hast given commandment to save me; for thou art
        my rock and my fortress.

071:004 Deliver me, O my God, out of the hand of the wicked, out of
        the hand of the unrighteous and cruel man.

071:005 For thou art my hope, O Lord GOD: thou art my trust from my
        youth.

071:006 By thee have I been holden up from the womb: thou art he that
        took me out of my mother's bowels: my praise shall be
        continually of thee.

071:007 I am as a wonder unto many; but thou art my strong refuge.

071:008 Let my mouth be filled with thy praise and with thy honour all
        the day.

071:009 Cast me not off in the time of old age; forsake me not when my
        strength faileth.

071:010 For mine enemies speak against me; and they that lay wait for
        my soul take counsel together,

071:011 Saying, God hath forsaken him: persecute and take him; for
        there is none to deliver him.

071:012 O God, be not far from me: O my God, make haste for my help.

071:013 Let them be confounded and consumed that are adversaries to my
        soul; let them be covered with reproach and dishonour that
        seek my hurt.

071:014 But I will hope continually, and will yet praise thee more and
        more.

071:015 My mouth shall shew forth thy righteousness and thy salvation
        all the day; for I know not the numbers thereof.

071:016 I will go in the strength of the Lord GOD: I will make mention
        of thy righteousness, even of thine only.

071:017 O God, thou hast taught me from my youth: and hitherto have I
        declared thy wondrous works.

071:018 Now also when I am old and greyheaded, O God, forsake me not;
        until I have shewed thy strength unto this generation, and thy
        power to every one that is to come.

071:019 Thy righteousness also, O God, is very high, who hast done
        great things: O God, who is like unto thee!

071:020 Thou, which hast shewed me great and sore troubles, shalt
        quicken me again, and shalt bring me up again from the depths
        of the earth.

071:021 Thou shalt increase my greatness, and comfort me on every
        side.

071:022 I will also praise thee with the psaltery, even thy truth, O
        my God: unto thee will I sing with the harp, O thou Holy One
        of Israel.

071:023 My lips shall greatly rejoice when I sing unto thee; and my
        soul, which thou hast redeemed.

071:024 My tongue also shall talk of thy righteousness all the day
        long: for they are confounded, for they are brought unto
        shame, that seek my hurt.

072:001 Give the king thy judgments, O God, and thy righteousness unto
        the king's son.

072:002 He shall judge thy people with righteousness, and thy poor
        with judgment.

072:003 The mountains shall bring peace to the people, and the little
        hills, by righteousness.

072:004 He shall judge the poor of the people, he shall save the
        children of the needy, and shall break in pieces the
        oppressor.

072:005 They shall fear thee as long as the sun and moon endure,
        throughout all generations.

072:006 He shall come down like rain upon the mown grass: as showers
        that water the earth.

072:007 In his days shall the righteous flourish; and abundance of
        peace so long as the moon endureth.

072:008 He shall have dominion also from sea to sea, and from the
        river unto the ends of the earth.

072:009 They that dwell in the wilderness shall bow before him; and
        his enemies shall lick the dust.

072:010 The kings of Tarshish and of the isles shall bring presents:
        the kings of Sheba and Seba shall offer gifts.

072:011 Yea, all kings shall fall down before him: all nations shall
        serve him.

072:012 For he shall deliver the needy when he crieth; the poor also,
        and him that hath no helper.

072:013 He shall spare the poor and needy, and shall save the souls of
        the needy.

072:014 He shall redeem their soul from deceit and violence: and
        precious shall their blood be in his sight.

072:015 And he shall live, and to him shall be given of the gold of
        Sheba: prayer also shall be made for him continually; and
        daily shall he be praised.

072:016 There shall be an handful of corn in the earth upon the top of
        the mountains; the fruit thereof shall shake like Lebanon: and
        they of the city shall flourish like grass of the earth.

072:017 His name shall endure for ever: his name shall be continued as
        long as the sun: and men shall be blessed in him: all nations
        shall call him blessed.

072:018 Blessed be the LORD God, the God of Israel, who only doeth
        wondrous things.

072:019 And blessed be his glorious name for ever: and let the whole
        earth be filled with his glory; Amen, and Amen.

072:020 The prayers of David the son of Jesse are ended.

073:001 Truly God is good to Israel, even to such as are of a clean
        heart.

073:002 But as for me, my feet were almost gone; my steps had well
        nigh slipped.

073:003 For I was envious at the foolish, when I saw the prosperity of
        the wicked.

073:004 For there are no bands in their death: but their strength is
        firm.

073:005 They are not in trouble as other men; neither are they plagued
        like other men.

073:006 Therefore pride compasseth them about as a chain; violence
        covereth them as a garment.

073:007 Their eyes stand out with fatness: they have more than heart
        could wish.

073:008 They are corrupt, and speak wickedly concerning oppression:
        they speak loftily.

073:009 They set their mouth against the heavens, and their tongue
        walketh through the earth.

073:010 Therefore his people return hither: and waters of a full cup
        are wrung out to them.

073:011 And they say, How doth God know? and is there knowledge in the
        most High?

073:012 Behold, these are the ungodly, who prosper in the world; they
        increase in riches.

073:013 Verily I have cleansed my heart in vain, and washed my hands
        in innocency.

073:014 For all the day long have I been plagued, and chastened every
        morning.

073:015 If I say, I will speak thus; behold, I should offend against
        the generation of thy children.

073:016 When I thought to know this, it was too painful for me;

073:017 Until I went into the sanctuary of God; then understood I
        their end.

073:018 Surely thou didst set them in slippery places: thou castedst
        them down into destruction.

073:019 How are they brought into desolation, as in a moment! they are
        utterly consumed with terrors.

073:020 As a dream when one awaketh; so, O Lord, when thou awakest,
        thou shalt despise their image.

073:021 Thus my heart was grieved, and I was pricked in my reins.

073:022 So foolish was I, and ignorant: I was as a beast before thee.

073:023 Nevertheless I am continually with thee: thou hast holden me
        by my right hand.

073:024 Thou shalt guide me with thy counsel, and afterward receive me
        to glory.

073:025 Whom have I in heaven but thee? and there is none upon earth
        that I desire beside thee.

073:026 My flesh and my heart faileth: but God is the strength of my
        heart, and my portion for ever.

073:027 For, lo, they that are far from thee shall perish: thou hast
        destroyed all them that go a whoring from thee.

073:028 But it is good for me to draw near to God: I have put my trust
        in the Lord GOD, that I may declare all thy works.

074:001 O God, why hast thou cast us off for ever? why doth thine
        anger smoke against the sheep of thy pasture?

074:002 Remember thy congregation, which thou hast purchased of old;
        the rod of thine inheritance, which thou hast redeemed; this
        mount Zion, wherein thou hast dwelt.

074:003 Lift up thy feet unto the perpetual desolations; even all that
        the enemy hath done wickedly in the sanctuary.

074:004 Thine enemies roar in the midst of thy congregations; they set
        up their ensigns for signs.

074:005 A man was famous according as he had lifted up axes upon the
        thick trees.

074:006 But now they break down the carved work thereof at once with
        axes and hammers.

074:007 They have cast fire into thy sanctuary, they have defiled by
        casting down the dwelling place of thy name to the ground.

074:008 They said in their hearts, Let us destroy them together: they
        have burned up all the synagogues of God in the land.

074:009 We see not our signs: there is no more any prophet: neither is
        there among us any that knoweth how long.

074:010 O God, how long shall the adversary reproach? shall the enemy
        blaspheme thy name for ever?

074:011 Why withdrawest thou thy hand, even thy right hand? pluck it
        out of thy bosom.

074:012 For God is my King of old, working salvation in the midst of
        the earth.

074:013 Thou didst divide the sea by thy strength: thou brakest the
        heads of the dragons in the waters.

074:014 Thou brakest the heads of leviathan in pieces, and gavest him
        to be meat to the people inhabiting the wilderness.

074:015 Thou didst cleave the fountain and the flood: thou driedst up
        mighty rivers.

074:016 The day is thine, the night also is thine: thou hast prepared
        the light and the sun.

074:017 Thou hast set all the borders of the earth: thou hast made
        summer and winter.

074:018 Remember this, that the enemy hath reproached, O LORD, and
        that the foolish people have blasphemed thy name.

074:019 O deliver not the soul of thy turtledove unto the multitude of
        the wicked: forget not the congregation of thy poor for ever.

074:020 Have respect unto the covenant: for the dark places of the
        earth are full of the habitations of cruelty.

074:021 O let not the oppressed return ashamed: let the poor and needy
        praise thy name.

074:022 Arise, O God, plead thine own cause: remember how the foolish
        man reproacheth thee daily.

074:023 Forget not the voice of thine enemies: the tumult of those
        that rise up against thee increaseth continually.

075:001 Unto thee, O God, do we give thanks, unto thee do we give
        thanks: for that thy name is near thy wondrous works declare.

075:002 When I shall receive the congregation I will judge uprightly.

075:003 The earth and all the inhabitants thereof are dissolved: I
        bear up the pillars of it. Selah.

075:004 I said unto the fools, Deal not foolishly: and to the wicked,
        Lift not up the horn:

075:005 Lift not up your horn on high: speak not with a stiff neck.

075:006 For promotion cometh neither from the east, nor from the west,
        nor from the south.

075:007 But God is the judge: he putteth down one, and setteth up
        another.

075:008 For in the hand of the LORD there is a cup, and the wine is
        red; it is full of mixture; and he poureth out of the same:
        but the dregs thereof, all the wicked of the earth shall wring
        them out, and drink them.

075:009 But I will declare for ever; I will sing praises to the God of
        Jacob.

075:010 All the horns of the wicked also will I cut off; but the horns
        of the righteous shall be exalted.

076:001 In Judah is God known: his name is great in Israel.

076:002 In Salem also is his tabernacle, and his dwelling place in
        Zion.

076:003 There brake he the arrows of the bow, the shield, and the
        sword, and the battle. Selah.

076:004 Thou art more glorious and excellent than the mountains of
        prey.

076:005 The stouthearted are spoiled, they have slept their sleep: and
        none of the men of might have found their hands.

076:006 At thy rebuke, O God of Jacob, both the chariot and horse are
        cast into a dead sleep.

076:007 Thou, even thou, art to be feared: and who may stand in thy
        sight when once thou art angry?

076:008 Thou didst cause judgment to be heard from heaven; the earth
        feared, and was still,

076:009 When God arose to judgment, to save all the meek of the earth.
        Selah.

076:010 Surely the wrath of man shall praise thee: the remainder of
        wrath shalt thou restrain.

076:011 Vow, and pay unto the LORD your God: let all that be round
        about him bring presents unto him that ought to be feared.

076:012 He shall cut off the spirit of princes: he is terrible to the
        kings of the earth.

077:001 I cried unto God with my voice, even unto God with my voice;
        and he gave ear unto me.

077:002 In the day of my trouble I sought the Lord: my sore ran in the
        night, and ceased not: my soul refused to be comforted.

077:003 I remembered God, and was troubled: I complained, and my
        spirit was overwhelmed. Selah.

077:004 Thou holdest mine eyes waking: I am so troubled that I cannot
        speak.

077:005 I have considered the days of old, the years of ancient times.

077:006 I call to remembrance my song in the night: I commune with
        mine own heart: and my spirit made diligent search.

077:007 Will the Lord cast off for ever? and will he be favourable no
        more?

077:008 Is his mercy clean gone for ever? doth his promise fail for
        evermore?

077:009 Hath God forgotten to be gracious? hath he in anger shut up
        his tender mercies? Selah.

077:010 And I said, This is my infirmity: but I will remember the
        years of the right hand of the most High.

077:011 I will remember the works of the LORD: surely I will remember
        thy wonders of old.

077:012 I will meditate also of all thy work, and talk of thy doings.

077:013 Thy way, O God, is in the sanctuary: who is so great a God as
        our God?

077:014 Thou art the God that doest wonders: thou hast declared thy
        strength among the people.

077:015 Thou hast with thine arm redeemed thy people, the sons of
        Jacob and Joseph. Selah.

077:016 The waters saw thee, O God, the waters saw thee; they were
        afraid: the depths also were troubled.

077:017 The clouds poured out water: the skies sent out a sound: thine
        arrows also went abroad.

077:018 The voice of thy thunder was in the heaven: the lightnings
        lightened the world: the earth trembled and shook.

077:019 Thy way is in the sea, and thy path in the great waters, and
        thy footsteps are not known.

077:020 Thou leddest thy people like a flock by the hand of Moses and
        Aaron.

078:001 Give ear, O my people, to my law: incline your ears to the
        words of my mouth.

078:002 I will open my mouth in a parable: I will utter dark sayings
        of old:

078:003 Which we have heard and known, and our fathers have told us.

078:004 We will not hide them from their children, shewing to the
        generation to come the praises of the LORD, and his strength,
        and his wonderful works that he hath done.

078:005 For he established a testimony in Jacob, and appointed a law
        in Israel, which he commanded our fathers, that they should
        make them known to their children:

078:006 That the generation to come might know them, even the children
        which should be born; who should arise and declare them to
        their children:

078:007 That they might set their hope in God, and not forget the
        works of God, but keep his commandments:

078:008 And might not be as their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious
        generation; a generation that set not their heart aright, and
        whose spirit was not stedfast with God.

078:009 The children of Ephraim, being armed, and carrying bows,
        turned back in the day of battle.

078:010 They kept not the covenant of God, and refused to walk in his
        law;

078:011 And forgat his works, and his wonders that he had shewed them.

078:012 Marvellous things did he in the sight of their fathers, in the
        land of Egypt, in the field of Zoan.

078:013 He divided the sea, and caused them to pass through; and he
        made the waters to stand as an heap.

078:014 In the daytime also he led them with a cloud, and all the
        night with a light of fire.

078:015 He clave the rocks in the wilderness, and gave them drink as
        out of the great depths.

078:016 He brought streams also out of the rock, and caused waters to
        run down like rivers.

078:017 And they sinned yet more against him by provoking the most
        High in the wilderness.

078:018 And they tempted God in their heart by asking meat for their
        lust.

078:019 Yea, they spake against God; they said, Can God furnish a
        table in the wilderness?

078:020 Behold, he smote the rock, that the waters gushed out, and the
        streams overflowed; can he give bread also? can he provide
        flesh for his people?

078:021 Therefore the LORD heard this, and was wroth: so a fire was
        kindled against Jacob, and anger also came up against Israel;

078:022 Because they believed not in God, and trusted not in his
        salvation:

078:023 Though he had commanded the clouds from above, and opened the
        doors of heaven,

078:024 And had rained down manna upon them to eat, and had given them
        of the corn of heaven.

078:025 Man did eat angels' food: he sent them meat to the full.

078:026 He caused an east wind to blow in the heaven: and by his power
        he brought in the south wind.

078:027 He rained flesh also upon them as dust, and feathered fowls
        like as the sand of the sea:

078:028 And he let it fall in the midst of their camp, round about
        their habitations.

078:029 So they did eat, and were well filled: for he gave them their
        own desire;

078:030 They were not estranged from their lust. But while their meat
        was yet in their mouths,

078:031 The wrath of God came upon them, and slew the fattest of them,
        and smote down the chosen men of Israel.

078:032 For all this they sinned still, and believed not for his
        wondrous works.

078:033 Therefore their days did he consume in vanity, and their years
        in trouble.

078:034 When he slew them, then they sought him: and they returned and
        enquired early after God.

078:035 And they remembered that God was their rock, and the high God
        their redeemer.

078:036 Nevertheless they did flatter him with their mouth, and they
        lied unto him with their tongues.

078:037 For their heart was not right with him, neither were they
        stedfast in his covenant.

078:038 But he, being full of compassion, forgave their iniquity, and
        destroyed them not: yea, many a time turned he his anger away,
        and did not stir up all his wrath.

078:039 For he remembered that they were but flesh; a wind that
        passeth away, and cometh not again.

078:040 How oft did they provoke him in the wilderness, and grieve him
        in the desert!

078:041 Yea, they turned back and tempted God, and limited the Holy
        One of Israel.

078:042 They remembered not his hand, nor the day when he delivered
        them from the enemy.

078:043 How he had wrought his signs in Egypt, and his wonders in the
        field of Zoan.

078:044 And had turned their rivers into blood; and their floods, that
        they could not drink.

078:045 He sent divers sorts of flies among them, which devoured them;
        and frogs, which destroyed them.

078:046 He gave also their increase unto the caterpiller, and their
        labour unto the locust.

078:047 He destroyed their vines with hail, and their sycomore trees
        with frost.

078:048 He gave up their cattle also to the hail, and their flocks to
        hot thunderbolts.

078:049 He cast upon them the fierceness of his anger, wrath, and
        indignation, and trouble, by sending evil angels among them.

078:050 He made a way to his anger; he spared not their soul from
        death, but gave their life over to the pestilence;

078:051 And smote all the firstborn in Egypt; the chief of their
        strength in the tabernacles of Ham:

078:052 But made his own people to go forth like sheep, and guided
        them in the wilderness like a flock.

078:053 And he led them on safely, so that they feared not: but the
        sea overwhelmed their enemies.

078:054 And he brought them to the border of his sanctuary, even to
        this mountain, which his right hand had purchased.

078:055 He cast out the heathen also before them, and divided them an
        inheritance by line, and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in
        their tents.

078:056 Yet they tempted and provoked the most high God, and kept not
        his testimonies:

078:057 But turned back, and dealt unfaithfully like their fathers:
        they were turned aside like a deceitful bow.

078:058 For they provoked him to anger with their high places, and
        moved him to jealousy with their graven images.

078:059 When God heard this, he was wroth, and greatly abhorred
        Israel:

078:060 So that he forsook the tabernacle of Shiloh, the tent which he
        placed among men;

078:061 And delivered his strength into captivity, and his glory into
        the enemy's hand.

078:062 He gave his people over also unto the sword; and was wroth
        with his inheritance.

078:063 The fire consumed their young men; and their maidens were not
        given to marriage.

078:064 Their priests fell by the sword; and their widows made no
        lamentation.

078:065 Then the LORD awaked as one out of sleep, and like a mighty
        man that shouteth by reason of wine.

078:066 And he smote his enemies in the hinder parts: he put them to a
        perpetual reproach.

078:067 Moreover he refused the tabernacle of Joseph, and chose not
        the tribe of Ephraim:

078:068 But chose the tribe of Judah, the mount Zion which he loved.

078:069 And he built his sanctuary like high palaces, like the earth
        which he hath established for ever.

078:070 He chose David also his servant, and took him from the
        sheepfolds:

078:071 From following the ewes great with young he brought him to
        feed Jacob his people, and Israel his inheritance.

078:072 So he fed them according to the integrity of his heart; and
        guided them by the skilfulness of his hands.

079:001 O god, the heathen are come into thine inheritance; thy holy
        temple have they defiled; they have laid Jerusalem on heaps.

079:002 The dead bodies of thy servants have they given to be meat
        unto the fowls of the heaven, the flesh of thy saints unto the
        beasts of the earth.

079:003 Their blood have they shed like water round about Jerusalem;
        and there was none to bury them.

079:004 We are become a reproach to our neighbours, a scorn and
        derision to them that are round about us.

079:005 How long, LORD? wilt thou be angry for ever? shall thy
        jealousy burn like fire?

079:006 Pour out thy wrath upon the heathen that have not known thee,
        and upon the kingdoms that have not called upon thy name.

079:007 For they have devoured Jacob, and laid waste his dwelling
        place.

079:008 O remember not against us former iniquities: let thy tender
        mercies speedily prevent us: for we are brought very low.

079:009 Help us, O God of our salvation, for the glory of thy name:
        and deliver us, and purge away our sins, for thy name's sake.

079:010 Wherefore should the heathen say, Where is their God? let him
        be known among the heathen in our sight by the revenging of
        the blood of thy servants which is shed.

079:011 Let the sighing of the prisoner come before thee; according to
        the greatness of thy power preserve thou those that are
        appointed to die;

079:012 And render unto our neighbours sevenfold into their bosom
        their reproach, wherewith they have reproached thee, O Lord.

079:013 So we thy people and sheep of thy pasture will give thee
        thanks for ever: we will shew forth thy praise to all
        generations.

080:001 Give ear, O Shepherd of Israel, thou that leadest Joseph like
        a flock; thou that dwellest between the cherubims, shine
        forth.

080:002 Before Ephraim and Benjamin and Manasseh stir up thy strength,
        and come and save us.

080:003 Turn us again, O God, and cause thy face to shine; and we
        shall be saved.

080:004 O LORD God of hosts, how long wilt thou be angry against the
        prayer of thy people?

080:005 Thou feedest them with the bread of tears; and givest them
        tears to drink in great measure.

080:006 Thou makest us a strife unto our neighbours: and our enemies
        laugh among themselves.

080:007 Turn us again, O God of hosts, and cause thy face to shine;
        and we shall be saved.

080:008 Thou hast brought a vine out of Egypt: thou hast cast out the
        heathen, and planted it.

080:009 Thou preparedst room before it, and didst cause it to take
        deep root, and it filled the land.

080:010 The hills were covered with the shadow of it, and the boughs
        thereof were like the goodly cedars.

080:011 She sent out her boughs unto the sea, and her branches unto
        the river.

080:012 Why hast thou then broken down her hedges, so that all they
        which pass by the way do pluck her?

080:013 The boar out of the wood doth waste it, and the wild beast of
        the field doth devour it.

080:014 Return, we beseech thee, O God of hosts: look down from
        heaven, and behold, and visit this vine;

080:015 And the vineyard which thy right hand hath planted, and the
        branch that thou madest strong for thyself.

080:016 It is burned with fire, it is cut down: they perish at the
        rebuke of thy countenance.

080:017 Let thy hand be upon the man of thy right hand, upon the son
        of man whom thou madest strong for thyself.

080:018 So will not we go back from thee: quicken us, and we will call
        upon thy name.

080:019 Turn us again, O LORD God of hosts, cause thy face to shine;
        and we shall be saved.

081:001 Sing aloud unto God our strength: make a joyful noise unto the
        God of Jacob.

081:002 Take a psalm, and bring hither the timbrel, the pleasant harp
        with the psaltery.

081:003 Blow up the trumpet in the new moon, in the time appointed, on
        our solemn feast day.

081:004 For this was a statute for Israel, and a law of the God of
        Jacob.

081:005 This he ordained in Joseph for a testimony, when he went out
        through the land of Egypt: where I heard a language that I
        understood not.

081:006 I removed his shoulder from the burden: his hands were
        delivered from the pots.

081:007 Thou calledst in trouble, and I delivered thee; I answered
        thee in the secret place of thunder: I proved thee at the
        waters of Meribah. Selah.

081:008 Hear, O my people, and I will testify unto thee: O Israel, if
        thou wilt hearken unto me;

081:009 There shall no strange god be in thee; neither shalt thou
        worship any strange god.

081:010 I am the LORD thy God, which brought thee out of the land of
        Egypt: open thy mouth wide, and I will fill it.

081:011 But my people would not hearken to my voice; and Israel would
        none of me.

081:012 So I gave them up unto their own hearts' lust: and they walked
        in their own counsels.

081:013 Oh that my people had hearkened unto me, and Israel had walked
        in my ways!

081:014 I should soon have subdued their enemies, and turned my hand
        against their adversaries.

081:015 The haters of the LORD should have submitted themselves unto
        him: but their time should have endured for ever.

081:016 He should have fed them also with the finest of the wheat: and
        with honey out of the rock should I have satisfied thee.

082:001 God standeth in the congregation of the mighty; he judgeth
        among the gods.

082:002 How long will ye judge unjustly, and accept the persons of the
        wicked? Selah.

082:003 Defend the poor and fatherless: do justice to the afflicted
        and needy.

082:004 Deliver the poor and needy: rid them out of the hand of the
        wicked.

082:005 They know not, neither will they understand; they walk on in
        darkness: all the foundations of the earth are out of course.

082:006 I have said, Ye are gods; and all of you are children of the
        most High.

082:007 But ye shall die like men, and fall like one of the princes.

082:008 Arise, O God, judge the earth: for thou shalt inherit all
        nations.

083:001 Keep not thou silence, O God: hold not thy peace, and be not
        still, O God.

083:002 For, lo, thine enemies make a tumult: and they that hate thee
        have lifted up the head.

083:003 They have taken crafty counsel against thy people, and
        consulted against thy hidden ones.

083:004 They have said, Come, and let us cut them off from being a
        nation; that the name of Israel may be no more in remembrance.

083:005 For they have consulted together with one consent: they are
        confederate against thee:

083:006 The tabernacles of Edom, and the Ishmaelites; of Moab, and the
        Hagarenes;

083:007 Gebal, and Ammon, and Amalek; the Philistines with the
        inhabitants of Tyre;

083:008 Assur also is joined with them: they have holpen the children
        of Lot. Selah.

083:009 Do unto them as unto the Midianites; as to Sisera, as to
        Jabin, at the brook of Kison:

083:010 Which perished at Endor: they became as dung for the earth.

083:011 Make their nobles like Oreb, and like Zeeb: yea, all their
        princes as Zebah, and as Zalmunna:

083:012 Who said, Let us take to ourselves the houses of God in
        possession.

083:013 O my God, make them like a wheel; as the stubble before the
        wind.

083:014 As the fire burneth a wood, and as the flame setteth the
        mountains on fire;

083:015 So persecute them with thy tempest, and make them afraid with
        thy storm.

083:016 Fill their faces with shame; that they may seek thy name, O
        LORD.

083:017 Let them be confounded and troubled for ever; yea, let them be
        put to shame, and perish:

083:018 That men may know that thou, whose name alone is JEHOVAH, art
        the most high over all the earth.

084:001 How amiable are thy tabernacles, O LORD of hosts!

084:002 My soul longeth, yea, even fainteth for the courts of the
        LORD: my heart and my flesh crieth out for the living God.

084:003 Yea, the sparrow hath found an house, and the swallow a nest
        for herself, where she may lay her young, even thine altars, O
        LORD of hosts, my King, and my God.

084:004 Blessed are they that dwell in thy house: they will be still
        praising thee. Selah.

084:005 Blessed is the man whose strength is in thee; in whose heart
        are the ways of them.

084:006 Who passing through the valley of Baca make it a well; the
        rain also filleth the pools.

084:007 They go from strength to strength, every one of them in Zion
        appeareth before God.

084:008 O LORD God of hosts, hear my prayer: give ear, O God of Jacob.
        Selah.

084:009 Behold, O God our shield, and look upon the face of thine
        anointed.

084:010 For a day in thy courts is better than a thousand. I had
        rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God, than to dwell
        in the tents of wickedness.

084:011 For the LORD God is a sun and shield: the LORD will give grace
        and glory: no good thing will he withhold from them that walk
        uprightly.

084:012 O LORD of hosts, blessed is the man that trusteth in thee.

085:001 Lord, thou hast been favourable unto thy land: thou hast
        brought back the captivity of Jacob.

085:002 Thou hast forgiven the iniquity of thy people, thou hast
        covered all their sin. Selah.

085:003 Thou hast taken away all thy wrath: thou hast turned thyself
        from the fierceness of thine anger.

085:004 Turn us, O God of our salvation, and cause thine anger toward
        us to cease.

085:005 Wilt thou be angry with us for ever? wilt thou draw out thine
        anger to all generations?

085:006 Wilt thou not revive us again: that thy people may rejoice in
        thee?

085:007 Shew us thy mercy, O LORD, and grant us thy salvation.

085:008 I will hear what God the LORD will speak: for he will speak
        peace unto his people, and to his saints: but let them not
        turn again to folly.

085:009 Surely his salvation is nigh them that fear him; that glory
        may dwell in our land.

085:010 Mercy and truth are met together; righteousness and peace have
        kissed each other.

085:011 Truth shall spring out of the earth; and righteousness shall
        look down from heaven.

085:012 Yea, the LORD shall give that which is good; and our land
        shall yield her increase.

085:013 Righteousness shall go before him; and shall set us in the way
        of his steps.

086:001 Bow down thine ear, O LORD, hear me: for I am poor and needy.

086:002 Preserve my soul; for I am holy: O thou my God, save thy
        servant that trusteth in thee.

086:003 Be merciful unto me, O Lord: for I cry unto thee daily.

086:004 Rejoice the soul of thy servant: for unto thee, O Lord, do I
        lift up my soul.

086:005 For thou, Lord, art good, and ready to forgive; and plenteous
        in mercy unto all them that call upon thee.

086:006 Give ear, O LORD, unto my prayer; and attend to the voice of
        my supplications.

086:007 In the day of my trouble I will call upon thee: for thou wilt
        answer me.

086:008 Among the gods there is none like unto thee, O Lord; neither
        are there any works like unto thy works.

086:009 All nations whom thou hast made shall come and worship before
        thee, O Lord; and shall glorify thy name.

086:010 For thou art great, and doest wondrous things: thou art God
        alone.

086:011 Teach me thy way, O LORD; I will walk in thy truth: unite my
        heart to fear thy name.

086:012 I will praise thee, O Lord my God, with all my heart: and I
        will glorify thy name for evermore.

086:013 For great is thy mercy toward me: and thou hast delivered my
        soul from the lowest hell.

086:014 O God, the proud are risen against me, and the assemblies of
        violent men have sought after my soul; and have not set thee
        before them.

086:015 But thou, O Lord, art a God full of compassion, and gracious,
        longsuffering, and plenteous in mercy and truth.

086:016 O turn unto me, and have mercy upon me; give thy strength unto
        thy servant, and save the son of thine handmaid.

086:017 Shew me a token for good; that they which hate me may see it,
        and be ashamed: because thou, LORD, hast holpen me, and
        comforted me.

087:001 His foundation is in the holy mountains.

087:002 The LORD loveth the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings
        of Jacob.

087:003 Glorious things are spoken of thee, O city of God. Selah.

087:004 I will make mention of Rahab and Babylon to them that know me:
        behold Philistia, and Tyre, with Ethiopia; this man was born
        there.

087:005 And of Zion it shall be said, This and that man was born in
        her: and the highest himself shall establish her.

087:006 The LORD shall count, when he writeth up the people, that this
        man was born there. Selah.

087:007 As well the singers as the players on instruments shall be
        there: all my springs are in thee.

088:001 O lord God of my salvation, I have cried day and night before
        thee:

088:002 Let my prayer come before thee: incline thine ear unto my cry;

088:003 For my soul is full of troubles: and my life draweth nigh unto
        the grave.

088:004 I am counted with them that go down into the pit: I am as a
        man that hath no strength:

088:005 Free among the dead, like the slain that lie in the grave,
        whom thou rememberest no more: and they are cut off from thy
        hand.

088:006 Thou hast laid me in the lowest pit, in darkness, in the
        deeps.

088:007 Thy wrath lieth hard upon me, and thou hast afflicted me with
        all thy waves. Selah.

088:008 Thou hast put away mine acquaintance far from me; thou hast
        made me an abomination unto them: I am shut up, and I cannot
        come forth.

088:009 Mine eye mourneth by reason of affliction: LORD, I have called
        daily upon thee, I have stretched out my hands unto thee.

088:010 Wilt thou shew wonders to the dead? shall the dead arise and
        praise thee? Selah.

088:011 Shall thy lovingkindness be declared in the grave? or thy
        faithfulness in destruction?

088:012 Shall thy wonders be known in the dark? and thy righteousness
        in the land of forgetfulness?

088:013 But unto thee have I cried, O LORD; and in the morning shall
        my prayer prevent thee.

088:014 LORD, why castest thou off my soul? why hidest thou thy face
        from me?

088:015 I am afflicted and ready to die from my youth up: while I
        suffer thy terrors I am distracted.

088:016 Thy fierce wrath goeth over me; thy terrors have cut me off.

088:017 They came round about me daily like water; they compassed me
        about together.

088:018 Lover and friend hast thou put far from me, and mine
        acquaintance into darkness.

089:001 I will sing of the mercies of the LORD for ever: with my mouth
        will I make known thy faithfulness to all generations.

089:002 For I have said, Mercy shall be built up for ever: thy
        faithfulness shalt thou establish in the very heavens.

089:003 I have made a covenant with my chosen, I have sworn unto David
        my servant,

089:004 Thy seed will I establish for ever, and build up thy throne to
        all generations. Selah.

089:005 And the heavens shall praise thy wonders, O LORD: thy
        faithfulness also in the congregation of the saints.

089:006 For who in the heaven can be compared unto the LORD? who among
        the sons of the mighty can be likened unto the LORD?

089:007 God is greatly to be feared in the assembly of the saints, and
        to be had in reverence of all them that are about him.

089:008 O LORD God of hosts, who is a strong LORD like unto thee? or
        to thy faithfulness round about thee?

089:009 Thou rulest the raging of the sea: when the waves thereof
        arise, thou stillest them.

089:010 Thou hast broken Rahab in pieces, as one that is slain; thou
        hast scattered thine enemies with thy strong arm.

089:011 The heavens are thine, the earth also is thine: as for the
        world and the fulness thereof, thou hast founded them.

089:012 The north and the south thou hast created them: Tabor and
        Hermon shall rejoice in thy name.

089:013 Thou hast a mighty arm: strong is thy hand, and high is thy
        right hand.

089:014 Justice and judgment are the habitation of thy throne: mercy
        and truth shall go before thy face.

089:015 Blessed is the people that know the joyful sound: they shall
        walk, O LORD, in the light of thy countenance.

089:016 In thy name shall they rejoice all the day: and in thy
        righteousness shall they be exalted.

089:017 For thou art the glory of their strength: and in thy favour
        our horn shall be exalted.

089:018 For the LORD is our defence; and the Holy One of Israel is our
        king.

089:019 Then thou spakest in vision to thy holy one, and saidst, I
        have laid help upon one that is mighty; I have exalted one
        chosen out of the people.

089:020 I have found David my servant; with my holy oil have I
        anointed him:

089:021 With whom my hand shall be established: mine arm also shall
        strengthen him.

089:022 The enemy shall not exact upon him; nor the son of wickedness
        afflict him.

089:023 And I will beat down his foes before his face, and plague them
        that hate him.

089:024 But my faithfulness and my mercy shall be with him: and in my
        name shall his horn be exalted.

089:025 I will set his hand also in the sea, and his right hand in the
        rivers.

089:026 He shall cry unto me, Thou art my father, my God, and the rock
        of my salvation.

089:027 Also I will make him my firstborn, higher than the kings of
        the earth.

089:028 My mercy will I keep for him for evermore, and my covenant
        shall stand fast with him.

089:029 His seed also will I make to endure for ever, and his throne
        as the days of heaven.

089:030 If his children forsake my law, and walk not in my judgments;

089:031 If they break my statutes, and keep not my commandments;

089:032 Then will I visit their transgression with the rod, and their
        iniquity with stripes.

089:033 Nevertheless my lovingkindness will I not utterly take from
        him, nor suffer my faithfulness to fail.

089:034 My covenant will I not break, nor alter the thing that is gone
        out of my lips.

089:035 Once have I sworn by my holiness that I will not lie unto
        David.

089:036 His seed shall endure for ever, and his throne as the sun
        before me.

089:037 It shall be established for ever as the moon, and as a
        faithful witness in heaven. Selah.

089:038 But thou hast cast off and abhorred, thou hast been wroth with
        thine anointed.

089:039 Thou hast made void the covenant of thy servant: thou hast
        profaned his crown by casting it to the ground.

089:040 Thou hast broken down all his hedges; thou hast brought his
        strong holds to ruin.

089:041 All that pass by the way spoil him: he is a reproach to his
        neighbours.

089:042 Thou hast set up the right hand of his adversaries; thou hast
        made all his enemies to rejoice.

089:043 Thou hast also turned the edge of his sword, and hast not made
        him to stand in the battle.

089:044 Thou hast made his glory to cease, and cast his throne down to
        the ground.

089:045 The days of his youth hast thou shortened: thou hast covered
        him with shame. Selah.

089:046 How long, LORD? wilt thou hide thyself for ever? shall thy
        wrath burn like fire?

089:047 Remember how short my time is: wherefore hast thou made all
        men in vain?

089:048 What man is he that liveth, and shall not see death? shall he
        deliver his soul from the hand of the grave? Selah.

089:049 Lord, where are thy former lovingkindnesses, which thou
        swarest unto David in thy truth?

089:050 Remember, Lord, the reproach of thy servants; how I do bear in
        my bosom the reproach of all the mighty people;

089:051 Wherewith thine enemies have reproached, O LORD; wherewith
        they have reproached the footsteps of thine anointed.

089:052 Blessed be the LORD for evermore. Amen, and Amen.

090:001 Lord, thou hast been our dwelling place in all generations.

090:002 Before the mountains were brought forth, or ever thou hadst
        formed the earth and the world, even from everlasting to
        everlasting, thou art God.

090:003 Thou turnest man to destruction; and sayest, Return, ye
        children of men.

090:004 For a thousand years in thy sight are but as yesterday when it
        is past, and as a watch in the night.

090:005 Thou carriest them away as with a flood; they are as a sleep:
        in the morning they are like grass which groweth up.

090:006 In the morning it flourisheth, and groweth up; in the evening
        it is cut down, and withereth.

090:007 For we are consumed by thine anger, and by thy wrath are we
        troubled.

090:008 Thou hast set our iniquities before thee, our secret sins in
        the light of thy countenance.

090:009 For all our days are passed away in thy wrath: we spend our
        years as a tale that is told.

090:010 The days of our years are threescore years and ten; and if by
        reason of strength they be fourscore years, yet is their
        strength labour and sorrow; for it is soon cut off, and we fly
        away.

090:011 Who knoweth the power of thine anger? even according to thy
        fear, so is thy wrath.

090:012 So teach us to number our days, that we may apply our hearts
        unto wisdom.

090:013 Return, O LORD, how long? and let it repent thee concerning
        thy servants.

090:014 O satisfy us early with thy mercy; that we may rejoice and be
        glad all our days.

090:015 Make us glad according to the days wherein thou hast afflicted
        us, and the years wherein we have seen evil.

090:016 Let thy work appear unto thy servants, and thy glory unto
        their children.

090:017 And let the beauty of the LORD our God be upon us: and
        establish thou the work of our hands upon us; yea, the work of
        our hands establish thou it.

091:001 He that dwelleth in the secret place of the most High shall
        abide under the shadow of the Almighty.

091:002 I will say of the LORD, He is my refuge and my fortress: my
        God; in him will I trust.

091:003 Surely he shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler, and
        from the noisome pestilence.

091:004 He shall cover thee with his feathers, and under his wings
        shalt thou trust: his truth shall be thy shield and buckler.

091:005 Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night; nor for the
        arrow that flieth by day;

091:006 Nor for the pestilence that walketh in darkness; nor for the
        destruction that wasteth at noonday.

091:007 A thousand shall fall at thy side, and ten thousand at thy
        right hand; but it shall not come nigh thee.

091:008 Only with thine eyes shalt thou behold and see the reward of
        the wicked.

091:009 Because thou hast made the LORD, which is my refuge, even the
        most High, thy habitation;

091:010 There shall no evil befall thee, neither shall any plague come
        nigh thy dwelling.

091:011 For he shall give his angels charge over thee, to keep thee in
        all thy ways.

091:012 They shall bear thee up in their hands, lest thou dash thy
        foot against a stone.

091:013 Thou shalt tread upon the lion and adder: the young lion and
        the dragon shalt thou trample under feet.

091:014 Because he hath set his love upon me, therefore will I deliver
        him: I will set him on high, because he hath known my name.

091:015 He shall call upon me, and I will answer him: I will be with
        him in trouble; I will deliver him, and honour him.

091:016 With long life will I satisfy him, and shew him my salvation.

092:001 IT IS A GOOD THING TO GIVE THANKS UNTO THE LORD, AND TO SING
        PRAISES UNTO THY NAME, O MOST HIGH:

092:002 To shew forth thy lovingkindness in the morning, and thy
        faithfulness every night,

092:003 Upon an instrument of ten strings, and upon the psaltery; upon
        the harp with a solemn sound.

092:004 For thou, LORD, hast made me glad through thy work: I will
        triumph in the works of thy hands.

092:005 O LORD, how great are thy works! and thy thoughts are very
        deep.

092:006 A brutish man knoweth not; neither doth a fool understand
        this.

092:007 When the wicked spring as the grass, and when all the workers
        of iniquity do flourish; it is that they shall be destroyed
        for ever:

092:008 But thou, LORD, art most high for evermore.

092:009 For, lo, thine enemies, O LORD, for, lo, thine enemies shall
        perish; all the workers of iniquity shall be scattered.

092:010 But my horn shalt thou exalt like the horn of an unicorn: I
        shall be anointed with fresh oil.

092:011 Mine eye also shall see my desire on mine enemies, and mine
        ears shall hear my desire of the wicked that rise up against
        me.

092:012 The righteous shall flourish like the palm tree: he shall grow
        like a cedar in Lebanon.

092:013 Those that be planted in the house of the LORD shall flourish
        in the courts of our God.

092:014 They shall still bring forth fruit in old age; they shall be
        fat and flourishing;

092:015 To shew that the LORD is upright: he is my rock, and there is
        no unrighteousness in him.

093:001 The LORD reigneth, he is clothed with majesty; the LORD is
        clothed with strength, wherewith he hath girded himself: the
        world also is stablished, that it cannot be moved.

093:002 Thy throne is established of old: thou art from everlasting.

093:003 The floods have lifted up, O LORD, the floods have lifted up
        their voice; the floods lift up their waves.

093:004 The LORD on high is mightier than the noise of many waters,
        yea, than the mighty waves of the sea.

093:005 Thy testimonies are very sure: holiness becometh thine house,
        O LORD, for ever.

094:001 O Lord God, to whom vengeance belongeth; O God, to whom
        vengeance belongeth, shew thyself.

094:002 Lift up thyself, thou judge of the earth: render a reward to
        the proud.

094:003 LORD, how long shall the wicked, how long shall the wicked
        triumph?

094:004 How long shall they utter and speak hard things? and all the
        workers of iniquity boast themselves?

094:005 They break in pieces thy people, O LORD, and afflict thine
        heritage.

094:006 They slay the widow and the stranger, and murder the
        fatherless.

094:007 Yet they say, The LORD shall not see, neither shall the God of
        Jacob regard it.

094:008 Understand, ye brutish among the people: and ye fools, when
        will ye be wise?

094:009 He that planted the ear, shall he not hear? he that formed the
        eye, shall he not see?

094:010 He that chastiseth the heathen, shall not he correct? he that
        teacheth man knowledge, shall not he know?

094:011 The LORD knoweth the thoughts of man, that they are vanity.

094:012 Blessed is the man whom thou chastenest, O LORD, and teachest
        him out of thy law;

094:013 That thou mayest give him rest from the days of adversity,
        until the pit be digged for the wicked.

094:014 For the LORD will not cast off his people, neither will he
        forsake his inheritance.

094:015 But judgment shall return unto righteousness: and all the
        upright in heart shall follow it.

094:016 Who will rise up for me against the evildoers? or who will
        stand up for me against the workers of iniquity?

094:017 Unless the LORD had been my help, my soul had almost dwelt in
        silence.

094:018 When I said, My foot slippeth; thy mercy, O LORD, held me up.

094:019 In the multitude of my thoughts within me thy comforts delight
        my soul.

094:020 Shall the throne of iniquity have fellowship with thee, which
        frameth mischief by a law?

094:021 They gather themselves together against the soul of the
        righteous, and condemn the innocent blood.

094:022 But the LORD is my defence; and my God is the rock of my
        refuge.

094:023 And he shall bring upon them their own iniquity, and shall cut
        them off in their own wickedness; yea, the LORD our God shall
        cut them off.

095:001 O come, let us sing unto the LORD: let us make a joyful noise
        to the rock of our salvation.

095:002 Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving, and make a
        joyful noise unto him with psalms.

095:003 For the LORD is a great God, and a great King above all gods.

095:004 In his hand are the deep places of the earth: the strength of
        the hills is his also.

095:005 The sea is his, and he made it: and his hands formed the dry
        land.

095:006 O come, let us worship and bow down: let us kneel before the
        LORD our maker.

095:007 For he is our God; and we are the people of his pasture, and
        the sheep of his hand. To day if ye will hear his voice,

095:008 Harden not your heart, as in the provocation, and as in the
        day of temptation in the wilderness:

095:009 When your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my work.

095:010 Forty years long was I grieved with this generation, and said,
        It is a people that do err in their heart, and they have not
        known my ways:

095:011 Unto whom I sware in my wrath that they should not enter into
        my rest.

096:001 O sing unto the LORD a new song: sing unto the LORD, all the
        earth.

096:002 Sing unto the LORD, bless his name; shew forth his salvation
        from day to day.

096:003 Declare his glory among the heathen, his wonders among all
        people.

096:004 For the LORD is great, and greatly to be praised: he is to be
        feared above all gods.

096:005 For all the gods of the nations are idols: but the LORD made
        the heavens.

096:006 Honour and majesty are before him: strength and beauty are in
        his sanctuary.

096:007 Give unto the LORD, O ye kindreds of the people, give unto the
        LORD glory and strength.

096:008 Give unto the LORD the glory due unto his name: bring an
        offering, and come into his courts.

096:009 O worship the LORD in the beauty of holiness: fear before him,
        all the earth.

096:010 Say among the heathen that the LORD reigneth: the world also
        shall be established that it shall not be moved: he shall
        judge the people righteously.

096:011 Let the heavens rejoice, and let the earth be glad; let the
        sea roar, and the fulness thereof.

096:012 Let the field be joyful, and all that is therein: then shall
        all the trees of the wood rejoice

096:013 Before the LORD: for he cometh, for he cometh to judge the
        earth: he shall judge the world with righteousness, and the
        people with his truth.

097:001 The LORD reigneth; let the earth rejoice; let the multitude of
        isles be glad thereof.

097:002 Clouds and darkness are round about him: righteousness and
        judgment are the habitation of his throne.

097:003 A fire goeth before him, and burneth up his enemies round
        about.

097:004 His lightnings enlightened the world: the earth saw, and
        trembled.

097:005 The hills melted like wax at the presence of the LORD, at the
        presence of the Lord of the whole earth.

097:006 The heavens declare his righteousness, and all the people see
        his glory.

097:007 Confounded be all they that serve graven images, that boast
        themselves of idols: worship him, all ye gods.

097:008 Zion heard, and was glad; and the daughters of Judah rejoiced
        because of thy judgments, O LORD.

097:009 For thou, LORD, art high above all the earth: thou art exalted
        far above all gods.

097:010 Ye that love the LORD, hate evil: he preserveth the souls of
        his saints; he delivereth them out of the hand of the wicked.

097:011 Light is sown for the righteous, and gladness for the upright
        in heart.

097:012 Rejoice in the LORD, ye righteous; and give thanks at the
        remembrance of his holiness.

098:001 O sing unto the LORD a new song; for he hath done marvellous
        things: his right hand, and his holy arm, hath gotten him the
        victory.

098:002 The LORD hath made known his salvation: his righteousness hath
        he openly shewed in the sight of the heathen.

098:003 He hath remembered his mercy and his truth toward the house of
        Israel: all the ends of the earth have seen the salvation of
        our God.

098:004 Make a joyful noise unto the LORD, all the earth: make a loud
        noise, and rejoice, and sing praise.

098:005 Sing unto the LORD with the harp; with the harp, and the voice
        of a psalm.

098:006 With trumpets and sound of cornet make a joyful noise before
        the LORD, the King.

098:007 Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof; the world, and they
        that dwell therein.

098:008 Let the floods clap their hands: let the hills be joyful
        together

098:009 Before the LORD; for he cometh to judge the earth: with
        righteousness shall he judge the world, and the people with
        equity.

099:001 The LORD reigneth; let the people tremble: he sitteth between
        the cherubims; let the earth be moved.

099:002 The LORD is great in Zion; and he is high above all the
        people.

099:003 Let them praise thy great and terrible name; for it is holy.

099:004 The king's strength also loveth judgment; thou dost establish
        equity, thou executest judgment and righteousness in Jacob.

099:005 Exalt ye the LORD our God, and worship at his footstool; for
        he is holy.

099:006 Moses and Aaron among his priests, and Samuel among them that
        call upon his name; they called upon the LORD, and he answered
        them.

099:007 He spake unto them in the cloudy pillar: they kept his
        testimonies, and the ordinance that he gave them.

099:008 Thou answeredst them, O LORD our God: thou wast a God that
        forgavest them, though thou tookest vengeance of their
        inventions.

099:009 Exalt the LORD our God, and worship at his holy hill; for the
        LORD our God is holy.

100:001 Make a joyful noise unto the LORD, all ye lands.

100:002 Serve the LORD with gladness: come before his presence with
        singing.

100:003 Know ye that the LORD he is God: it is he that hath made us,
        and not we ourselves; we are his people, and the sheep of his
        pasture.

100:004 Enter into his gates with thanksgiving, and into his courts
        with praise: be thankful unto him, and bless his name.

100:005 For the LORD is good; his mercy is everlasting; and his truth
        endureth to all generations.

101:001 I will sing of mercy and judgment: unto thee, O LORD, will I
        sing.

101:002 I will behave myself wisely in a perfect way. O when wilt thou
        come unto me? I will walk within my house with a perfect
        heart.

101:003 I will set no wicked thing before mine eyes: I hate the work
        of them that turn aside; it shall not cleave to me.

101:004 A froward heart shall depart from me: I will not know a wicked
        person.

101:005 Whoso privily slandereth his neighbour, him will I cut off:
        him that hath an high look and a proud heart will not I
        suffer.

101:006 Mine eyes shall be upon the faithful of the land, that they
        may dwell with me: he that walketh in a perfect way, he shall
        serve me.

101:007 He that worketh deceit shall not dwell within my house: he
        that telleth lies shall not tarry in my sight.

101:008 I will early destroy all the wicked of the land; that I may
        cut off all wicked doers from the city of the LORD.

102:001 Hear my prayer, O LORD, and let my cry come unto thee.

102:002 Hide not thy face from me in the day when I am in trouble;
        incline thine ear unto me: in the day when I call answer me
        speedily.

102:003 For my days are consumed like smoke, and my bones are burned
        as an hearth.

102:004 My heart is smitten, and withered like grass; so that I forget
        to eat my bread.

102:005 By reason of the voice of my groaning my bones cleave to my
        skin.

102:006 I am like a pelican of the wilderness: I am like an owl of the
        desert.

102:007 I watch, and am as a sparrow alone upon the house top.

102:008 Mine enemies reproach me all the day; and they that are mad
        against me are sworn against me.

102:009 For I have eaten ashes like bread, and mingled my drink with
        weeping.

102:010 Because of thine indignation and thy wrath: for thou hast
        lifted me up, and cast me down.

102:011 My days are like a shadow that declineth; and I am withered
        like grass.

102:012 But thou, O LORD, shall endure for ever; and thy remembrance
        unto all generations.

102:013 Thou shalt arise, and have mercy upon Zion: for the time to
        favour her, yea, the set time, is come.

102:014 For thy servants take pleasure in her stones, and favour the
        dust thereof.

102:015 So the heathen shall fear the name of the LORD, and all the
        kings of the earth thy glory.

102:016 When the LORD shall build up Zion, he shall appear in his
        glory.

102:017 He will regard the prayer of the destitute, and not despise
        their prayer.

102:018 This shall be written for the generation to come: and the
        people which shall be created shall praise the LORD.

102:019 For he hath looked down from the height of his sanctuary; from
        heaven did the LORD behold the earth;

102:020 To hear the groaning of the prisoner; to loose those that are
        appointed to death;

102:021 To declare the name of the LORD in Zion, and his praise in
        Jerusalem;

102:022 When the people are gathered together, and the kingdoms, to
        serve the LORD.

102:023 He weakened my strength in the way; he shortened my days.

102:024 I said, O my God, take me not away in the midst of my days:
        thy years are throughout all generations.

102:025 Of old hast thou laid the foundation of the earth: and the
        heavens are the work of thy hands.

102:026 They shall perish, but thou shalt endure: yea, all of them
        shall wax old like a garment; as a vesture shalt thou change
        them, and they shall be changed:

102:027 But thou art the same, and thy years shall have no end.

102:028 The children of thy servants shall continue, and their seed
        shall be established before thee.

103:001 Bless the LORD, O my soul: and all that is within me, bless
        his holy name.

103:002 Bless the LORD, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits:

103:003 Who forgiveth all thine iniquities; who healeth all thy
        diseases;

103:004 Who redeemeth thy life from destruction; who crowneth thee
        with lovingkindness and tender mercies;

103:005 Who satisfieth thy mouth with good things; so that thy youth
        is renewed like the eagle's.

103:006 The LORD executeth righteousness and judgment for all that are
        oppressed.

103:007 He made known his ways unto Moses, his acts unto the children
        of Israel.

103:008 The LORD is merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and
        plenteous in mercy.

103:009 He will not always chide: neither will he keep his anger for
        ever.

103:010 He hath not dealt with us after our sins; nor rewarded us
        according to our iniquities.

103:011 For as the heaven is high above the earth, so great is his
        mercy toward them that fear him.

103:012 As far as the east is from the west, so far hath he removed
        our transgressions from us.

103:013 Like as a father pitieth his children, so the LORD pitieth
        them that fear him.

103:014 For he knoweth our frame; he remembereth that we are dust.

103:015 As for man, his days are as grass: as a flower of the field,
        so he flourisheth.

103:016 For the wind passeth over it, and it is gone; and the place
        thereof shall know it no more.

103:017 But the mercy of the LORD is from everlasting to everlasting
        upon them that fear him, and his righteousness unto children's
        children;

103:018 To such as keep his covenant, and to those that remember his
        commandments to do them.

103:019 The LORD hath prepared his throne in the heavens; and his
        kingdom ruleth over all.

103:020 Bless the LORD, ye his angels, that excel in strength, that do
        his commandments, hearkening unto the voice of his word.

103:021 Bless ye the LORD, all ye his hosts; ye ministers of his, that
        do his pleasure.

103:022 Bless the LORD, all his works in all places of his dominion:
        bless the LORD, O my soul.

104:001 Bless the LORD, O my soul. O LORD my God, thou art very great;
        thou art clothed with honour and majesty.

104:002 Who coverest thyself with light as with a garment: who
        stretchest out the heavens like a curtain:

104:003 Who layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters: who maketh
        the clouds his chariot: who walketh upon the wings of the
        wind:

104:004 Who maketh his angels spirits; his ministers a flaming fire:

104:005 Who laid the foundations of the earth, that it should not be
        removed for ever.

104:006 Thou coveredst it with the deep as with a garment: the waters
        stood above the mountains.

104:007 At thy rebuke they fled; at the voice of thy thunder they
        hasted away.

104:008 They go up by the mountains; they go down by the valleys unto
        the place which thou hast founded for them.

104:009 Thou hast set a bound that they may not pass over; that they
        turn not again to cover the earth.

104:010 He sendeth the springs into the valleys, which run among the
        hills.

104:011 They give drink to every beast of the field: the wild asses
        quench their thirst.

104:012 By them shall the fowls of the heaven have their habitation,
        which sing among the branches.

104:013 He watereth the hills from his chambers: the earth is
        satisfied with the fruit of thy works.

104:014 He causeth the grass to grow for the cattle, and herb for the
        service of man: that he may bring forth food out of the earth;

104:015 And wine that maketh glad the heart of man, and oil to make
        his face to shine, and bread which strengtheneth man's heart.

104:016 The trees of the LORD are full of sap; the cedars of Lebanon,
        which he hath planted;

104:017 Where the birds make their nests: as for the stork, the fir
        trees are her house.

104:018 The high hills are a refuge for the wild goats; and the rocks
        for the conies.

104:019 He appointed the moon for seasons: the sun knoweth his going
        down.

104:020 Thou makest darkness, and it is night: wherein all the beasts
        of the forest do creep forth.

104:021 The young lions roar after their prey, and seek their meat
        from God.

104:022 The sun ariseth, they gather themselves together, and lay them
        down in their dens.

104:023 Man goeth forth unto his work and to his labour until the
        evening.

104:024 O LORD, how manifold are thy works! in wisdom hast thou made
        them all: the earth is full of thy riches.

104:025 So is this great and wide sea, wherein are things creeping
        innumerable, both small and great beasts.

104:026 There go the ships: there is that leviathan, whom thou hast
        made to play therein.

104:027 These wait all upon thee; that thou mayest give them their
        meat in due season.

104:028 That thou givest them they gather: thou openest thine hand,
        they are filled with good.

104:029 Thou hidest thy face, they are troubled: thou takest away
        their breath, they die, and return to their dust.

104:030 Thou sendest forth thy spirit, they are created: and thou
        renewest the face of the earth.

104:031 The glory of the LORD shall endure for ever: the LORD shall
        rejoice in his works.

104:032 He looketh on the earth, and it trembleth: he toucheth the
        hills, and they smoke.

104:033 I will sing unto the LORD as long as I live: I will sing
        praise to my God while I have my being.

104:034 My meditation of him shall be sweet: I will be glad in the
        LORD.

104:035 Let the sinners be consumed out of the earth, and let the
        wicked be no more. Bless thou the LORD, O my soul. Praise ye
        the LORD.

105:001 O give thanks unto the LORD; call upon his name: make known
        his deeds among the people.

105:002 Sing unto him, sing psalms unto him: talk ye of all his
        wondrous works.

105:003 Glory ye in his holy name: let the heart of them rejoice that
        seek the LORD.

105:004 Seek the LORD, and his strength: seek his face evermore.

105:005 Remember his marvellous works that he hath done; his wonders,
        and the judgments of his mouth;

105:006 O ye seed of Abraham his servant, ye children of Jacob his
        chosen.

105:007 He is the LORD our God: his judgments are in all the earth.

105:008 He hath remembered his covenant for ever, the word which he
        commanded to a thousand generations.

105:009 Which covenant he made with Abraham, and his oath unto Isaac;

105:010 And confirmed the same unto Jacob for a law, and to Israel for
        an everlasting covenant:

105:011 Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, the lot of
        your inheritance:

105:012 When they were but a few men in number; yea, very few, and
        strangers in it.

105:013 When they went from one nation to another, from one kingdom to
        another people;

105:014 He suffered no man to do them wrong: yea, he reproved kings
        for their sakes;

105:015 Saying, Touch not mine anointed, and do my prophets no harm.

105:016 Moreover he called for a famine upon the land: he brake the
        whole staff of bread.

105:017 He sent a man before them, even Joseph, who was sold for a
        servant:

105:018 Whose feet they hurt with fetters: he was laid in iron:

105:019 Until the time that his word came: the word of the LORD tried
        him.

105:020 The king sent and loosed him; even the ruler of the people,
        and let him go free.

105:021 He made him lord of his house, and ruler of all his substance:

105:022 To bind his princes at his pleasure; and teach his senators
        wisdom.

105:023 Israel also came into Egypt; and Jacob sojourned in the land
        of Ham.

105:024 And he increased his people greatly; and made them stronger
        than their enemies.

105:025 He turned their heart to hate his people, to deal subtilly
        with his servants.

105:026 He sent Moses his servant; and Aaron whom he had chosen.

105:027 They shewed his signs among them, and wonders in the land of
        Ham.

105:028 He sent darkness, and made it dark; and they rebelled not
        against his word.

105:029 He turned their waters into blood, and slew their fish.

105:030 Their land brought forth frogs in abundance, in the chambers
        of their kings.

105:031 He spake, and there came divers sorts of flies, and lice in
        all their coasts.

105:032 He gave them hail for rain, and flaming fire in their land.

105:033 He smote their vines also and their fig trees; and brake the
        trees of their coasts.

105:034 He spake, and the locusts came, and caterpillers, and that
        without number,

105:035 And did eat up all the herbs in their land, and devoured the
        fruit of their ground.

105:036 He smote also all the firstborn in their land, the chief of
        all their strength.

105:037 He brought them forth also with silver and gold: and there was
        not one feeble person among their tribes.

105:038 Egypt was glad when they departed: for the fear of them fell
        upon them.

105:039 He spread a cloud for a covering; and fire to give light in
        the night.

105:040 The people asked, and he brought quails, and satisfied them
        with the bread of heaven.

105:041 He opened the rock, and the waters gushed out; they ran in the
        dry places like a river.

105:042 For he remembered his holy promise, and Abraham his servant.

105:043 And he brought forth his people with joy, and his chosen with
        gladness:

105:044 And gave them the lands of the heathen: and they inherited the
        labour of the people;

105:045 That they might observe his statutes, and keep his laws.
        Praise ye the LORD.

106:001 Praise ye the LORD. O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is
        good: for his mercy endureth for ever.

106:002 Who can utter the mighty acts of the LORD? who can shew forth
        all his praise?

106:003 Blessed are they that keep judgment, and he that doeth
        righteousness at all times.

106:004 Remember me, O LORD, with the favour that thou bearest unto
        thy people: O visit me with thy salvation;

106:005 That I may see the good of thy chosen, that I may rejoice in
        the gladness of thy nation, that I may glory with thine
        inheritance.

106:006 We have sinned with our fathers, we have committed iniquity,
        we have done wickedly.

106:007 Our fathers understood not thy wonders in Egypt; they
        remembered not the multitude of thy mercies; but provoked him
        at the sea, even at the Red sea.

106:008 Nevertheless he saved them for his name's sake, that he might
        make his mighty power to be known.

106:009 He rebuked the Red sea also, and it was dried up: so he led
        them through the depths, as through the wilderness.

106:010 And he saved them from the hand of him that hated them, and
        redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.

106:011 And the waters covered their enemies: there was not one of
        them left.

106:012 Then believed they his words; they sang his praise.

106:013 They soon forgat his works; they waited not for his counsel:

106:014 But lusted exceedingly in the wilderness, and tempted God in
        the desert.

106:015 And he gave them their request; but sent leanness into their
        soul.

106:016 They envied Moses also in the camp, and Aaron the saint of the
        LORD.

106:017 The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan and covered the
        company of Abiram.

106:018 And a fire was kindled in their company; the flame burned up
        the wicked.

106:019 They made a calf in Horeb, and worshipped the molten image.

106:020 Thus they changed their glory into the similitude of an ox
        that eateth grass.

106:021 They forgat God their saviour, which had done great things in
        Egypt;

106:022 Wondrous works in the land of Ham, and terrible things by the
        Red sea.

106:023 Therefore he said that he would destroy them, had not Moses
        his chosen stood before him in the breach, to turn away his
        wrath, lest he should destroy them.

106:024 Yea, they despised the pleasant land, they believed not his
        word:

106:025 But murmured in their tents, and hearkened not unto the voice
        of the LORD.

106:026 Therefore he lifted up his hand against them, to overthrow
        them in the wilderness:

106:027 To overthrow their seed also among the nations, and to scatter
        them in the lands.

106:028 They joined themselves also unto Baalpeor, and ate the
        sacrifices of the dead.

106:029 Thus they provoked him to anger with their inventions: and the
        plague brake in upon them.

106:030 Then stood up Phinehas, and executed judgment: and so the
        plague was stayed.

106:031 And that was counted unto him for righteousness unto all
        generations for evermore.

106:032 They angered him also at the waters of strife, so that it went
        ill with Moses for their sakes:

106:033 Because they provoked his spirit, so that he spake unadvisedly
        with his lips.

106:034 They did not destroy the nations, concerning whom the LORD
        commanded them:

106:035 But were mingled among the heathen, and learned their works.

106:036 And they served their idols: which were a snare unto them.

106:037 Yea, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto
        devils,

106:038 And shed innocent blood, even the blood of their sons and of
        their daughters, whom they sacrificed unto the idols of
        Canaan: and the land was polluted with blood.

106:039 Thus were they defiled with their own works, and went a
        whoring with their own inventions.

106:040 Therefore was the wrath of the LORD kindled against his
        people, insomuch that he abhorred his own inheritance.

106:041 And he gave them into the hand of the heathen; and they that
        hated them ruled over them.

106:042 Their enemies also oppressed them, and they were brought into
        subjection under their hand.

106:043 Many times did he deliver them; but they provoked him with
        their counsel, and were brought low for their iniquity.

106:044 Nevertheless he regarded their affliction, when he heard their
        cry:

106:045 And he remembered for them his covenant, and repented
        according to the multitude of his mercies.

106:046 He made them also to be pitied of all those that carried them
        captives.

106:047 Save us, O LORD our God, and gather us from among the heathen,
        to give thanks unto thy holy name, and to triumph in thy
        praise.

106:048 Blessed be the LORD God of Israel from everlasting to
        everlasting: and let all the people say, Amen. Praise ye the
        LORD.

107:001 O give thanks unto the LORD, for he is good: for his mercy
        endureth for ever.

107:002 Let the redeemed of the LORD say so, whom he hath redeemed
        from the hand of the enemy;

107:003 And gathered them out of the lands, from the east, and from
        the west, from the north, and from the south.

107:004 They wandered in the wilderness in a solitary way; they found
        no city to dwell in.

107:005 Hungry and thirsty, their soul fainted in them.

107:006 Then they cried unto the LORD in their trouble, and he
        delivered them out of their distresses.

107:007 And he led them forth by the right way, that they might go to
        a city of habitation.

107:008 Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for
        his wonderful works to the children of men!

107:009 For he satisfieth the longing soul, and filleth the hungry
        soul with goodness.

107:010 Such as sit in darkness and in the shadow of death, being
        bound in affliction and iron;

107:011 Because they rebelled against the words of God, and contemned
        the counsel of the most High:

107:012 Therefore he brought down their heart with labour; they fell
        down, and there was none to help.

107:013 Then they cried unto the LORD in their trouble, and he saved
        them out of their distresses.

107:014 He brought them out of darkness and the shadow of death, and
        brake their bands in sunder.

107:015 Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for
        his wonderful works to the children of men!

107:016 For he hath broken the gates of brass, and cut the bars of
        iron in sunder.

107:017 Fools because of their transgression, and because of their
        iniquities, are afflicted.

107:018 Their soul abhorreth all manner of meat; and they draw near
        unto the gates of death.

107:019 Then they cry unto the LORD in their trouble, and he saveth
        them out of their distresses.

107:020 He sent his word, and healed them, and delivered them from
        their destructions.

107:021 Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for
        his wonderful works to the children of men!

107:022 And let them sacrifice the sacrifices of thanksgiving, and
        declare his works with rejoicing.

107:023 They that go down to the sea in ships, that do business in
        great waters;

107:024 These see the works of the LORD, and his wonders in the deep.

107:025 For he commandeth, and raiseth the stormy wind, which lifteth
        up the waves thereof.

107:026 They mount up to the heaven, they go down again to the depths:
        their soul is melted because of trouble.

107:027 They reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man, and are
        at their wit's end.

107:028 Then they cry unto the LORD in their trouble, and he bringeth
        them out of their distresses.

107:029 He maketh the storm a calm, so that the waves thereof are
        still.

107:030 Then are they glad because they be quiet; so he bringeth them
        unto their desired haven.

107:031 Oh that men would praise the LORD for his goodness, and for
        his wonderful works to the children of men!

107:032 Let them exalt him also in the congregation of the people, and
        praise him in the assembly of the elders.

107:033 He turneth rivers into a wilderness, and the watersprings into
        dry ground;

107:034 A fruitful land into barrenness, for the wickedness of them
        that dwell therein.

107:035 He turneth the wilderness into a standing water, and dry
        ground into watersprings.

107:036 And there he maketh the hungry to dwell, that they may prepare
        a city for habitation;

107:037 And sow the fields, and plant vineyards, which may yield
        fruits of increase.

107:038 He blesseth them also, so that they are multiplied greatly;
        and suffereth not their cattle to decrease.

107:039 Again, they are minished and brought low through oppression,
        affliction, and sorrow.

107:040 He poureth contempt upon princes, and causeth them to wander
        in the wilderness, where there is no way.

107:041 Yet setteth he the poor on high from affliction, and maketh
        him families like a flock.

107:042 The righteous shall see it, and rejoice: and all iniquity
        shall stop her mouth.

107:043 Whoso is wise, and will observe these things, even they shall
        understand the lovingkindness of the LORD.

108:001 O god, my heart is fixed; I will sing and give praise, even
        with my glory.

108:002 Awake, psaltery and harp: I myself will awake early.

108:003 I will praise thee, O LORD, among the people: and I will sing
        praises unto thee among the nations.

108:004 For thy mercy is great above the heavens: and thy truth
        reacheth unto the clouds.

108:005 Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens: and thy glory above
        all the earth;

108:006 That thy beloved may be delivered: save with thy right hand,
        and answer me.

108:007 God hath spoken in his holiness; I will rejoice, I will divide
        Shechem, and mete out the valley of Succoth.

108:008 Gilead is mine; Manasseh is mine; Ephraim also is the strength
        of mine head; Judah is my lawgiver;

108:009 Moab is my washpot; over Edom will I cast out my shoe; over
        Philistia will I triumph.

108:010 Who will bring me into the strong city? who will lead me into
        Edom?

108:011 Wilt not thou, O God, who hast cast us off? and wilt not thou,
        O God, go forth with our hosts?

108:012 Give us help from trouble: for vain is the help of man.

108:013 Through God we shall do valiantly: for he it is that shall
        tread down our enemies.

109:001 Hold not thy peace, O God of my praise;

109:002 For the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of the deceitful are
        opened against me: they have spoken against me with a lying
        tongue.

109:003 They compassed me about also with words of hatred; and fought
        against me without a cause.

109:004 For my love they are my adversaries: but I give myself unto
        prayer.

109:005 And they have rewarded me evil for good, and hatred for my
        love.

109:006 Set thou a wicked man over him: and let Satan stand at his
        right hand.

109:007 When he shall be judged, let him be condemned: and let his
        prayer become sin.

109:008 Let his days be few; and let another take his office.

109:009 Let his children be fatherless, and his wife a widow.

109:010 Let his children be continually vagabonds, and beg: let them
        seek their bread also out of their desolate places.

109:011 Let the extortioner catch all that he hath; and let the
        strangers spoil his labour.

109:012 Let there be none to extend mercy unto him: neither let there
        be any to favour his fatherless children.

109:013 Let his posterity be cut off; and in the generation following
        let their name be blotted out.

109:014 Let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered with the LORD;
        and let not the sin of his mother be blotted out.

109:015 Let them be before the LORD continually, that he may cut off
        the memory of them from the earth.

109:016 Because that he remembered not to shew mercy, but persecuted
        the poor and needy man, that he might even slay the broken in
        heart.

109:017 As he loved cursing, so let it come unto him: as he delighted
        not in blessing, so let it be far from him.

109:018 As he clothed himself with cursing like as with his garment,
        so let it come into his bowels like water, and like oil into
        his bones.

109:019 Let it be unto him as the garment which covereth him, and for
        a girdle wherewith he is girded continually.

109:020 Let this be the reward of mine adversaries from the LORD, and
        of them that speak evil against my soul.

109:021 But do thou for me, O GOD the Lord, for thy name's sake:
        because thy mercy is good, deliver thou me.

109:022 For I am poor and needy, and my heart is wounded within me.

109:023 I am gone like the shadow when it declineth: I am tossed up
        and down as the locust.

109:024 My knees are weak through fasting; and my flesh faileth of
        fatness.

109:025 I became also a reproach unto them: when they looked upon me
        they shaked their heads.

109:026 Help me, O LORD my God: O save me according to thy mercy:

109:027 That they may know that this is thy hand; that thou, LORD,
        hast done it.

109:028 Let them curse, but bless thou: when they arise, let them be
        ashamed; but let thy servant rejoice.

109:029 Let mine adversaries be clothed with shame, and let them cover
        themselves with their own confusion, as with a mantle.

109:030 I will greatly praise the LORD with my mouth; yea, I will
        praise him among the multitude.

109:031 For he shall stand at the right hand of the poor, to save him
        from those that condemn his soul.

110:001 The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou at my right hand, until I
        make thine enemies thy footstool.

110:002 The LORD shall send the rod of thy strength out of Zion: rule
        thou in the midst of thine enemies.

110:003 Thy people shall be willing in the day of thy power, in the
        beauties of holiness from the womb of the morning: thou hast
        the dew of thy youth.

110:004 The LORD hath sworn, and will not repent, Thou art a priest
        for ever after the order of Melchizedek.

110:005 The Lord at thy right hand shall strike through kings in the
        day of his wrath.

110:006 He shall judge among the heathen, he shall fill the places
        with the dead bodies; he shall wound the heads over many
        countries.

110:007 He shall drink of the brook in the way: therefore shall he
        lift up the head.

111:001 Praise ye the LORD. I will praise the LORD with my whole
        heart, in the assembly of the upright, and in the
        congregation.

111:002 The works of the LORD are great, sought out of all them that
        have pleasure therein.

111:003 His work is honourable and glorious: and his righteousness
        endureth for ever.

111:004 He hath made his wonderful works to be remembered: the LORD is
        gracious and full of compassion.

111:005 He hath given meat unto them that fear him: he will ever be
        mindful of his covenant.

111:006 He hath shewed his people the power of his works, that he may
        give them the heritage of the heathen.

111:007 The works of his hands are verity and judgment; all his
        commandments are sure.

111:008 They stand fast for ever and ever, and are done in truth and
        uprightness.

111:009 He sent redemption unto his people: he hath commanded his
        covenant for ever: holy and reverend is his name.

111:010 The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom: a good
        understanding have all they that do his commandments: his
        praise endureth for ever.

112:001 Praise ye the LORD. Blessed is the man that feareth the LORD,
        that delighteth greatly in his commandments.

112:002 His seed shall be mighty upon earth: the generation of the
        upright shall be blessed.

112:003 Wealth and riches shall be in his house: and his righteousness
        endureth for ever.

112:004 Unto the upright there ariseth light in the darkness: he is
        gracious, and full of compassion, and righteous.

112:005 A good man sheweth favour, and lendeth: he will guide his
        affairs with discretion.

112:006 Surely he shall not be moved for ever: the righteous shall be
        in everlasting remembrance.

112:007 He shall not be afraid of evil tidings: his heart is fixed,
        trusting in the LORD.

112:008 His heart is established, he shall not be afraid, until he see
        his desire upon his enemies.

112:009 He hath dispersed, he hath given to the poor; his
        righteousness endureth for ever; his horn shall be exalted
        with honour.

112:010 The wicked shall see it, and be grieved; he shall gnash with
        his teeth, and melt away: the desire of the wicked shall
        perish.

113:001 Praise ye the LORD. Praise, O ye servants of the LORD, praise
        the name of the LORD.

113:002 Blessed be the name of the LORD from this time forth and for
        evermore.

113:003 From the rising of the sun unto the going down of the same the
        LORD's name is to be praised.

113:004 The LORD is high above all nations, and his glory above the
        heavens.

113:005 Who is like unto the LORD our God, who dwelleth on high,

113:006 Who humbleth himself to behold the things that are in heaven,
        and in the earth!

113:007 He raiseth up the poor out of the dust, and lifteth the needy
        out of the dunghill;

113:008 That he may set him with princes, even with the princes of his
        people.

113:009 He maketh the barren woman to keep house, and to be a joyful
        mother of children. Praise ye the LORD.

114:001 When Israel went out of Egypt, the house of Jacob from a
        people of strange language;

114:002 Judah was his sanctuary, and Israel his dominion.

114:003 The sea saw it, and fled: Jordan was driven back.

114:004 The mountains skipped like rams, and the little hills like
        lambs.

114:005 What ailed thee, O thou sea, that thou fleddest? thou Jordan,
        that thou wast driven back?

114:006 Ye mountains, that ye skipped like rams; and ye little hills,
        like lambs?

114:007 Tremble, thou earth, at the presence of the Lord, at the
        presence of the God of Jacob;

114:008 Which turned the rock into a standing water, the flint into a
        fountain of waters.

115:001 Not unto us, O LORD, not unto us, but unto thy name give
        glory, for thy mercy, and for thy truth's sake.

115:002 Wherefore should the heathen say, Where is now their God?

115:003 But our God is in the heavens: he hath done whatsoever he hath
        pleased.

115:004 Their idols are silver and gold, the work of men's hands.

115:005 They have mouths, but they speak not: eyes have they, but they
        see not:

115:006 They have ears, but they hear not: noses have they, but they
        smell not:

115:007 They have hands, but they handle not: feet have they, but they
        walk not: neither speak they through their throat.

115:008 They that make them are like unto them; so is every one that
        trusteth in them.

115:009 O Israel, trust thou in the LORD: he is their help and their
        shield.

115:010 O house of Aaron, trust in the LORD: he is their help and
        their shield.

115:011 Ye that fear the LORD, trust in the LORD: he is their help and
        their shield.

115:012 The LORD hath been mindful of us: he will bless us; he will
        bless the house of Israel; he will bless the house of Aaron.

115:013 He will bless them that fear the LORD, both small and great.

115:014 The LORD shall increase you more and more, you and your
        children.

115:015 Ye are blessed of the LORD which made heaven and earth.

115:016 The heaven, even the heavens, are the LORD's: but the earth
        hath he given to the children of men.

115:017 The dead praise not the LORD, neither any that go down into
        silence.

115:018 But we will bless the LORD from this time forth and for
        evermore. Praise the LORD.

116:001 I love the LORD, because he hath heard my voice and my
        supplications.

116:002 Because he hath inclined his ear unto me, therefore will I
        call upon him as long as I live.

116:003 The sorrows of death compassed me, and the pains of hell gat
        hold upon me: I found trouble and sorrow.

116:004 Then called I upon the name of the LORD; O LORD, I beseech
        thee, deliver my soul.

116:005 Gracious is the LORD, and righteous; yea, our God is merciful.

116:006 The LORD preserveth the simple: I was brought low, and he
        helped me.

116:007 Return unto thy rest, O my soul; for the LORD hath dealt
        bountifully with thee.

116:008 For thou hast delivered my soul from death, mine eyes from
        tears, and my feet from falling.

116:009 I will walk before the LORD in the land of the living.

116:010 I believed, therefore have I spoken: I was greatly afflicted:

116:011 I said in my haste, All men are liars.

116:012 What shall I render unto the LORD for all his benefits toward
        me?

116:013 I will take the cup of salvation, and call upon the name of
        the LORD.

116:014 I will pay my vows unto the LORD now in the presence of all
        his people.

116:015 Precious in the sight of the LORD is the death of his saints.

116:016 O LORD, truly I am thy servant; I am thy servant, and the son
        of thine handmaid: thou hast loosed my bonds.

116:017 I will offer to thee the sacrifice of thanksgiving, and will
        call upon the name of the LORD.

116:018 I will pay my vows unto the LORD now in the presence of all
        his people.

116:019 In the courts of the LORD's house, in the midst of thee, O
        Jerusalem. Praise ye the LORD.

117:001 O praise the LORD, all ye nations: praise him, all ye people.

117:002 For his merciful kindness is great toward us: and the truth of
        the LORD endureth for ever. Praise ye the LORD.

118:001 O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is good: because his mercy
        endureth for ever.

118:002 Let Israel now say, that his mercy endureth for ever.

118:003 Let the house of Aaron now say, that his mercy endureth for
        ever.

118:004 Let them now that fear the LORD say, that his mercy endureth
        for ever.

118:005 I called upon the LORD in distress: the LORD answered me, and
        set me in a large place.

118:006 The LORD is on my side; I will not fear: what can man do unto
        me?

118:007 The LORD taketh my part with them that help me: therefore
        shall I see my desire upon them that hate me.

118:008 It is better to trust in the LORD than to put confidence in
        man.

118:009 It is better to trust in the LORD than to put confidence in
        princes.

118:010 All nations compassed me about: but in the name of the LORD
        will I destroy them.

118:011 They compassed me about; yea, they compassed me about: but in
        the name of the LORD I will destroy them.

118:012 They compassed me about like bees: they are quenched as the
        fire of thorns: for in the name of the LORD I will destroy
        them.

118:013 Thou hast thrust sore at me that I might fall: but the LORD
        helped me.

118:014 The LORD is my strength and song, and is become my salvation.

118:015 The voice of rejoicing and salvation is in the tabernacles of
        the righteous: the right hand of the LORD doeth valiantly.

118:016 The right hand of the LORD is exalted: the right hand of the
        LORD doeth valiantly.

118:017 I shall not die, but live, and declare the works of the LORD.

118:018 The LORD hath chastened me sore: but he hath not given me over
        unto death.

118:019 Open to me the gates of righteousness: I will go into them,
        and I will praise the LORD:

118:020 This gate of the LORD, into which the righteous shall enter.

118:021 I will praise thee: for thou hast heard me, and art become my
        salvation.

118:022 The stone which the builders refused is become the head stone
        of the corner.

118:023 This is the LORD's doing; it is marvellous in our eyes.

118:024 This is the day which the LORD hath made; we will rejoice and
        be glad in it.

118:025 Save now, I beseech thee, O LORD: O LORD, I beseech thee, send
        now prosperity.

118:026 Blessed be he that cometh in the name of the LORD: we have
        blessed you out of the house of the LORD.

118:027 God is the LORD, which hath shewed us light: bind the
        sacrifice with cords, even unto the horns of the altar.

118:028 Thou art my God, and I will praise thee: thou art my God, I
        will exalt thee.

118:029 O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is good: for his mercy
        endureth for ever.

119:001 Blessed are the undefiled in the way, who walk in the law of
        the LORD.

119:002 Blessed are they that keep his testimonies, and that seek him
        with the whole heart.

119:003 They also do no iniquity: they walk in his ways.

119:004 Thou hast commanded us to keep thy precepts diligently.

119:005 O that my ways were directed to keep thy statutes!

119:006 Then shall I not be ashamed, when I have respect unto all thy
        commandments.

119:007 I will praise thee with uprightness of heart, when I shall
        have learned thy righteous judgments.

119:008 I will keep thy statutes: O forsake me not utterly.

119:009 Wherewithal shall a young man cleanse his way? by taking heed
        thereto according to thy word.

119:010 With my whole heart have I sought thee: O let me not wander
        from thy commandments.

119:011 Thy word have I hid in mine heart, that I might not sin
        against thee.

119:012 Blessed art thou, O LORD: teach me thy statutes.

119:013 With my lips have I declared all the judgments of thy mouth.

119:014 I have rejoiced in the way of thy testimonies, as much as in
        all riches.

119:015 I will meditate in thy precepts, and have respect unto thy
        ways.

119:016 I will delight myself in thy statutes: I will not forget thy
        word.

119:017 Deal bountifully with thy servant, that I may live, and keep
        thy word.

119:018 Open thou mine eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out of
        thy law.

119:019 I am a stranger in the earth: hide not thy commandments from
        me.

119:020 My soul breaketh for the longing that it hath unto thy
        judgments at all times.

119:021 Thou hast rebuked the proud that are cursed, which do err from
        thy commandments.

119:022 Remove from me reproach and contempt; for I have kept thy
        testimonies.

119:023 Princes also did sit and speak against me: but thy servant did
        meditate in thy statutes.

119:024 Thy testimonies also are my delight and my counsellors.

119:025 My soul cleaveth unto the dust: quicken thou me according to
        thy word.

119:026 I have declared my ways, and thou heardest me: teach me thy
        statutes.

119:027 Make me to understand the way of thy precepts: so shall I talk
        of thy wondrous works.

119:028 My soul melteth for heaviness: strengthen thou me according
        unto thy word.

119:029 Remove from me the way of lying: and grant me thy law
        graciously.

119:030 I have chosen the way of truth: thy judgments have I laid
        before me.

119:031 I have stuck unto thy testimonies: O LORD, put me not to
        shame.

119:032 I will run the way of thy commandments, when thou shalt
        enlarge my heart.

119:033 Teach me, O LORD, the way of thy statutes; and I shall keep it
        unto the end.

119:034 Give me understanding, and I shall keep thy law; yea, I shall
        observe it with my whole heart.

119:035 Make me to go in the path of thy commandments; for therein do
        I delight.

119:036 Incline my heart unto thy testimonies, and not to
        covetousness.

119:037 Turn away mine eyes from beholding vanity; and quicken thou me
        in thy way.

119:038 Stablish thy word unto thy servant, who is devoted to thy
        fear.

119:039 Turn away my reproach which I fear: for thy judgments are
        good.

119:040 Behold, I have longed after thy precepts: quicken me in thy
        righteousness.

119:041 Let thy mercies come also unto me, O LORD, even thy salvation,
        according to thy word.

119:042 So shall I have wherewith to answer him that reproacheth me:
        for I trust in thy word.

119:043 And take not the word of truth utterly out of my mouth; for I
        have hoped in thy judgments.

119:044 So shall I keep thy law continually for ever and ever.

119:045 And I will walk at liberty: for I seek thy precepts.

119:046 I will speak of thy testimonies also before kings, and will
        not be ashamed.

119:047 And I will delight myself in thy commandments, which I have
        loved.

119:048 My hands also will I lift up unto thy commandments, which I
        have loved; and I will meditate in thy statutes.

119:049 Remember the word unto thy servant, upon which thou hast
        caused me to hope.

119:050 This is my comfort in my affliction: for thy word hath
        quickened me.

119:051 The proud have had me greatly in derision: yet have I not
        declined from thy law.

119:052 I remembered thy judgments of old, O LORD; and have comforted
        myself.

119:053 Horror hath taken hold upon me because of the wicked that
        forsake thy law.

119:054 Thy statutes have been my songs in the house of my pilgrimage.

119:055 I have remembered thy name, O LORD, in the night, and have
        kept thy law.

119:056 This I had, because I kept thy precepts.

119:057 Thou art my portion, O LORD: I have said that I would keep thy
        words.

119:058 I intreated thy favour with my whole heart: be merciful unto
        me according to thy word.

119:059 I thought on my ways, and turned my feet unto thy testimonies.

119:060 I made haste, and delayed not to keep thy commandments.

119:061 The bands of the wicked have robbed me: but I have not
        forgotten thy law.

119:062 At midnight I will rise to give thanks unto thee because of
        thy righteous judgments.

119:063 I am a companion of all them that fear thee, and of them that
        keep thy precepts.

119:064 The earth, O LORD, is full of thy mercy: teach me thy
        statutes.

119:065 Thou hast dealt well with thy servant, O LORD, according unto
        thy word.

119:066 Teach me good judgment and knowledge: for I have believed thy
        commandments.

119:067 Before I was afflicted I went astray: but now have I kept thy
        word.

119:068 Thou art good, and doest good; teach me thy statutes.

119:069 The proud have forged a lie against me: but I will keep thy
        precepts with my whole heart.

119:070 Their heart is as fat as grease; but I delight in thy law.

119:071 It is good for me that I have been afflicted; that I might
        learn thy statutes.

119:072 The law of thy mouth is better unto me than thousands of gold
        and silver.

119:073 Thy hands have made me and fashioned me: give me
        understanding, that I may learn thy commandments.

119:074 They that fear thee will be glad when they see me; because I
        have hoped in thy word.

119:075 I know, O LORD, that thy judgments are right, and that thou in
        faithfulness hast afflicted me.

119:076 Let, I pray thee, thy merciful kindness be for my comfort,
        according to thy word unto thy servant.

119:077 Let thy tender mercies come unto me, that I may live: for thy
        law is my delight.

119:078 Let the proud be ashamed; for they dealt perversely with me
        without a cause: but I will meditate in thy precepts.

119:079 Let those that fear thee turn unto me, and those that have
        known thy testimonies.

119:080 Let my heart be sound in thy statutes; that I be not ashamed.

119:081 My soul fainteth for thy salvation: but I hope in thy word.

119:082 Mine eyes fail for thy word, saying, When wilt thou comfort
        me?

119:083 For I am become like a bottle in the smoke; yet do I not
        forget thy statutes.

119:084 How many are the days of thy servant? when wilt thou execute
        judgment on them that persecute me?

119:085 The proud have digged pits for me, which are not after thy
        law.

119:086 All thy commandments are faithful: they persecute me
        wrongfully; help thou me.

119:087 They had almost consumed me upon earth; but I forsook not thy
        precepts.

119:088 Quicken me after thy lovingkindness; so shall I keep the
        testimony of thy mouth.

119:089 For ever, O LORD, thy word is settled in heaven.

119:090 Thy faithfulness is unto all generations: thou hast
        established the earth, and it abideth.

119:091 They continue this day according to thine ordinances: for all
        are thy servants.

119:092 Unless thy law had been my delights, I should then have
        perished in mine affliction.

119:093 I will never forget thy precepts: for with them thou hast
        quickened me.

119:094 I am thine, save me: for I have sought thy precepts.

119:095 The wicked have waited for me to destroy me: but I will
        consider thy testimonies.

119:096 I have seen an end of all perfection: but thy commandment is
        exceeding broad.

119:097 O how I love thy law! it is my meditation all the day.

119:098 Thou through thy commandments hast made me wiser than mine
        enemies: for they are ever with me.

119:099 I have more understanding than all my teachers: for thy
        testimonies are my meditation.

119:100 I understand more than the ancients, because I keep thy
        precepts.

119:101 I have refrained my feet from every evil way, that I might
        keep thy word.

119:102 I have not departed from thy judgments: for thou hast taught
        me.

119:103 How sweet are thy words unto my taste! yea, sweeter than honey
        to my mouth!

119:104 Through thy precepts I get understanding: therefore I hate
        every false way.

119:105 Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path.

119:106 I have sworn, and I will perform it, that I will keep thy
        righteous judgments.

119:107 I am afflicted very much: quicken me, O LORD, according unto
        thy word.

119:108 Accept, I beseech thee, the freewill offerings of my mouth, O
        LORD, and teach me thy judgments.

119:109 My soul is continually in my hand: yet do I not forget thy
        law.

119:110 The wicked have laid a snare for me: yet I erred not from thy
        precepts.

119:111 Thy testimonies have I taken as an heritage for ever: for they
        are the rejoicing of my heart.

119:112 I have inclined mine heart to perform thy statutes alway, even
        unto the end.

119:113 I hate vain thoughts: but thy law do I love.

119:114 Thou art my hiding place and my shield: I hope in thy word.

119:115 Depart from me, ye evildoers: for I will keep the commandments
        of my God.

119:116 Uphold me according unto thy word, that I may live: and let me
        not be ashamed of my hope.

119:117 Hold thou me up, and I shall be safe: and I will have respect
        unto thy statutes continually.

119:118 Thou hast trodden down all them that err from thy statutes:
        for their deceit is falsehood.

119:119 Thou puttest away all the wicked of the earth like dross:
        therefore I love thy testimonies.

119:120 My flesh trembleth for fear of thee; and I am afraid of thy
        judgments.

119:121 I have done judgment and justice: leave me not to mine
        oppressors.

119:122 Be surety for thy servant for good: let not the proud oppress
        me.

119:123 Mine eyes fail for thy salvation, and for the word of thy
        righteousness.

119:124 Deal with thy servant according unto thy mercy, and teach me
        thy statutes.

119:125 I am thy servant; give me understanding, that I may know thy
        testimonies.

119:126 It is time for thee, LORD, to work: for they have made void
        thy law.

119:127 Therefore I love thy commandments above gold; yea, above fine
        gold.

119:128 Therefore I esteem all thy precepts concerning all things to
        be right; and I hate every false way.

119:129 Thy testimonies are wonderful: therefore doth my soul keep
        them.

119:130 The entrance of thy words giveth light; it giveth
        understanding unto the simple.

119:131 I opened my mouth, and panted: for I longed for thy
        commandments.

119:132 Look thou upon me, and be merciful unto me, as thou usest to
        do unto those that love thy name.

119:133 Order my steps in thy word: and let not any iniquity have
        dominion over me.

119:134 Deliver me from the oppression of man: so will I keep thy
        precepts.

119:135 Make thy face to shine upon thy servant; and teach me thy
        statutes.

119:136 Rivers of waters run down mine eyes, because they keep not thy
        law.

119:137 Righteous art thou, O LORD, and upright are thy judgments.

119:138 Thy testimonies that thou hast commanded are righteous and
        very faithful.

119:139 My zeal hath consumed me, because mine enemies have forgotten
        thy words.

119:140 Thy word is very pure: therefore thy servant loveth it.

119:141 I am small and despised: yet do not I forget thy precepts.

119:142 Thy righteousness is an everlasting righteousness, and thy law
