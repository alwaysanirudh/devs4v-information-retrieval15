        is the truth.

119:143 Trouble and anguish have taken hold on me: yet thy
        commandments are my delights.

119:144 The righteousness of thy testimonies is everlasting: give me
        understanding, and I shall live.

119:145 I cried with my whole heart; hear me, O LORD: I will keep thy
        statutes.

119:146 I cried unto thee; save me, and I shall keep thy testimonies.

119:147 I prevented the dawning of the morning, and cried: I hoped in
        thy word.

119:148 Mine eyes prevent the night watches, that I might meditate in
        thy word.

119:149 Hear my voice according unto thy lovingkindness: O LORD,
        quicken me according to thy judgment.

119:150 They draw nigh that follow after mischief: they are far from
        thy law.

119:151 Thou art near, O LORD; and all thy commandments are truth.

119:152 Concerning thy testimonies, I have known of old that thou hast
        founded them for ever.

119:153 Consider mine affliction, and deliver me: for I do not forget
        thy law.

119:154 Plead my cause, and deliver me: quicken me according to thy
        word.

119:155 Salvation is far from the wicked: for they seek not thy
        statutes.

119:156 Great are thy tender mercies, O LORD: quicken me according to
        thy judgments.

119:157 Many are my persecutors and mine enemies; yet do I not decline
        from thy testimonies.

119:158 I beheld the transgressors, and was grieved; because they kept
        not thy word.

119:159 Consider how I love thy precepts: quicken me, O LORD,
        according to thy lovingkindness.

119:160 Thy word is true from the beginning: and every one of thy
        righteous judgments endureth for ever.

119:161 Princes have persecuted me without a cause: but my heart
        standeth in awe of thy word.

119:162 I rejoice at thy word, as one that findeth great spoil.

119:163 I hate and abhor lying: but thy law do I love.

119:164 Seven times a day do I praise thee because of thy righteous
        judgments.

119:165 Great peace have they which love thy law: and nothing shall
        offend them.

119:166 LORD, I have hoped for thy salvation, and done thy
        commandments.

119:167 My soul hath kept thy testimonies; and I love them
        exceedingly.

119:168 I have kept thy precepts and thy testimonies: for all my ways
        are before thee.

119:169 Let my cry come near before thee, O LORD: give me
        understanding according to thy word.

119:170 Let my supplication come before thee: deliver me according to
        thy word.

119:171 My lips shall utter praise, when thou hast taught me thy
        statutes.

119:172 My tongue shall speak of thy word: for all thy commandments
        are righteousness.

119:173 Let thine hand help me; for I have chosen thy precepts.

119:174 I have longed for thy salvation, O LORD; and thy law is my
        delight.

119:175 Let my soul live, and it shall praise thee; and let thy
        judgments help me.

119:176 I have gone astray like a lost sheep; seek thy servant; for I
        do not forget thy commandments.

120:001 In my distress I cried unto the LORD, and he heard me.

120:002 Deliver my soul, O LORD, from lying lips, and from a deceitful
        tongue.

120:003 What shall be given unto thee? or what shall be done unto
        thee, thou false tongue?

120:004 Sharp arrows of the mighty, with coals of juniper.

120:005 Woe is me, that I sojourn in Mesech, that I dwell in the tents
        of Kedar!

120:006 My soul hath long dwelt with him that hateth peace.

120:007 I am for peace: but when I speak, they are for war.

121:001 I will lift up mine eyes unto the hills, from whence cometh my
        help.

121:002 My help cometh from the LORD, which made heaven and earth.

121:003 He will not suffer thy foot to be moved: he that keepeth thee
        will not slumber.

121:004 Behold, he that keepeth Israel shall neither slumber nor
        sleep.

121:005 The LORD is thy keeper: the LORD is thy shade upon thy right
        hand.

121:006 The sun shall not smite thee by day, nor the moon by night.

121:007 The LORD shall preserve thee from all evil: he shall preserve
        thy soul.

121:008 The LORD shall preserve thy going out and thy coming in from
        this time forth, and even for evermore.

122:001 I was glad when they said unto me, Let us go into the house of
        the LORD.

122:002 Our feet shall stand within thy gates, O Jerusalem.

122:003 Jerusalem is builded as a city that is compact together:

122:004 Whither the tribes go up, the tribes of the LORD, unto the
        testimony of Israel, to give thanks unto the name of the LORD.

122:005 For there are set thrones of judgment, the thrones of the
        house of David.

122:006 Pray for the peace of Jerusalem: they shall prosper that love
        thee.

122:007 Peace be within thy walls, and prosperity within thy palaces.

122:008 For my brethren and companions' sakes, I will now say, Peace
        be within thee.

122:009 Because of the house of the LORD our God I will seek thy good.

123:001 Unto thee lift I up mine eyes, O thou that dwellest in the
        heavens.

123:002 Behold, as the eyes of servants look unto the hand of their
        masters, and as the eyes of a maiden unto the hand of her
        mistress; so our eyes wait upon the LORD our God, until that
        he have mercy upon us.

123:003 Have mercy upon us, O LORD, have mercy upon us: for we are
        exceedingly filled with contempt.

123:004 Our soul is exceedingly filled with the scorning of those that
        are at ease, and with the contempt of the proud.

124:001 If it had not been the LORD who was on our side, now may
        Israel say;

124:002 If it had not been the LORD who was on our side, when men rose
        up against us:

124:003 Then they had swallowed us up quick, when their wrath was
        kindled against us:

124:004 Then the waters had overwhelmed us, the stream had gone over
        our soul:

124:005 Then the proud waters had gone over our soul.

124:006 Blessed be the LORD, who hath not given us as a prey to their
        teeth.

124:007 Our soul is escaped as a bird out of the snare of the fowlers:
        the snare is broken, and we are escaped.

124:008 Our help is in the name of the LORD, who made heaven and
        earth.

125:001 They that trust in the LORD shall be as mount Zion, which
        cannot be removed, but abideth for ever.

125:002 As the mountains are round about Jerusalem, so the LORD is
        round about his people from henceforth even for ever.

125:003 For the rod of the wicked shall not rest upon the lot of the
        righteous; lest the righteous put forth their hands unto
        iniquity.

125:004 Do good, O LORD, unto those that be good, and to them that are
        upright in their hearts.

125:005 As for such as turn aside unto their crooked ways, the LORD
        shall lead them forth with the workers of iniquity: but peace
        shall be upon Israel.

126:001 When the LORD turned again the captivity of Zion, we were like
        them that dream.

126:002 Then was our mouth filled with laughter, and our tongue with
        singing: then said they among the heathen, The LORD hath done
        great things for them.

126:003 The LORD hath done great things for us; whereof we are glad.

126:004 Turn again our captivity, O LORD, as the streams in the south.

126:005 They that sow in tears shall reap in joy.

126:006 He that goeth forth and weepeth, bearing precious seed, shall
        doubtless come again with rejoicing, bringing his sheaves with
        him.

127:001 Except the LORD build the house, they labour in vain that
        build it: except the LORD keep the city, the watchman waketh
        but in vain.

127:002 It is vain for you to rise up early, to sit up late, to eat
        the bread of sorrows: for so he giveth his beloved sleep.

127:003 Lo, children are an heritage of the LORD: and the fruit of the
        womb is his reward.

127:004 As arrows are in the hand of a mighty man; so are children of
        the youth.

127:005 Happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them: they shall
        not be ashamed, but they shall speak with the enemies in the
        gate.

128:001 Blessed is every one that feareth the LORD; that walketh in
        his ways.

128:002 For thou shalt eat the labour of thine hands: happy shalt thou
        be, and it shall be well with thee.

128:003 Thy wife shall be as a fruitful vine by the sides of thine
        house: thy children like olive plants round about thy table.

128:004 Behold, that thus shall the man be blessed that feareth the
        LORD.

128:005 The LORD shall bless thee out of Zion: and thou shalt see the
        good of Jerusalem all the days of thy life.

128:006 Yea, thou shalt see thy children's children, and peace upon
        Israel.

129:001 Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth, may Israel
        now say:

129:002 Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth: yet they
        have not prevailed against me.

129:003 The plowers plowed upon my back: they made long their furrows.

129:004 The LORD is righteous: he hath cut asunder the cords of the
        wicked.

129:005 Let them all be confounded and turned back that hate Zion.

129:006 Let them be as the grass upon the housetops, which withereth
        afore it groweth up:

129:007 Wherewith the mower filleth not his hand; nor he that bindeth
        sheaves his bosom.

129:008 Neither do they which go by say, The blessing of the LORD be
        upon you: we bless you in the name of the LORD.

130:001 Out of the depths have I cried unto thee, O LORD.

130:002 Lord, hear my voice: let thine ears be attentive to the voice
        of my supplications.

130:003 If thou, LORD, shouldest mark iniquities, O Lord, who shall
        stand?

130:004 But there is forgiveness with thee, that thou mayest be
        feared.

130:005 I wait for the LORD, my soul doth wait, and in his word do I
        hope.

130:006 My soul waiteth for the Lord more than they that watch for the
        morning: I say, more than they that watch for the morning.

130:007 Let Israel hope in the LORD: for with the LORD there is mercy,
        and with him is plenteous redemption.

130:008 And he shall redeem Israel from all his iniquities.

131:001 Lord, my heart is not haughty, nor mine eyes lofty: neither do
        I exercise myself in great matters, or in things too high for
        me.

131:002 Surely I have behaved and quieted myself, as a child that is
        weaned of his mother: my soul is even as a weaned child.

131:003 Let Israel hope in the LORD from henceforth and for ever.

132:001 Lord, remember David, and all his afflictions:

132:002 How he sware unto the LORD, and vowed unto the mighty God of
        Jacob;

132:003 Surely I will not come into the tabernacle of my house, nor go
        up into my bed;

132:004 I will not give sleep to mine eyes, or slumber to mine
        eyelids,

132:005 Until I find out a place for the LORD, an habitation for the
        mighty God of Jacob.

132:006 Lo, we heard of it at Ephratah: we found it in the fields of
        the wood.

132:007 We will go into his tabernacles: we will worship at his
        footstool.

132:008 Arise, O LORD, into thy rest; thou, and the ark of thy
        strength.

132:009 Let thy priests be clothed with righteousness; and let thy
        saints shout for joy.

132:010 For thy servant David's sake turn not away the face of thine
        anointed.

132:011 The LORD hath sworn in truth unto David; he will not turn from
        it; Of the fruit of thy body will I set upon thy throne.

132:012 If thy children will keep my covenant and my testimony that I
        shall teach them, their children shall also sit upon thy
        throne for evermore.

132:013 For the LORD hath chosen Zion; he hath desired it for his
        habitation.

132:014 This is my rest for ever: here will I dwell; for I have
        desired it.

132:015 I will abundantly bless her provision: I will satisfy her poor
        with bread.

132:016 I will also clothe her priests with salvation: and her saints
        shall shout aloud for joy.

132:017 There will I make the horn of David to bud: I have ordained a
        lamp for mine anointed.

132:018 His enemies will I clothe with shame: but upon himself shall
        his crown flourish.

133:001 Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell
        together in unity!

133:002 It is like the precious ointment upon the head, that ran down
        upon the beard, even Aaron's beard: that went down to the
        skirts of his garments;

133:003 As the dew of Hermon, and as the dew that descended upon the
        mountains of Zion: for there the LORD commanded the blessing,
        even life for evermore.

134:001 Behold, bless ye the LORD, all ye servants of the LORD, which
        by night stand in the house of the LORD.

134:002 Lift up your hands in the sanctuary, and bless the LORD.

134:003 The LORD that made heaven and earth bless thee out of Zion.

135:001 Praise ye the LORD. Praise ye the name of the LORD; praise
        him, O ye servants of the LORD.

135:002 Ye that stand in the house of the LORD, in the courts of the
        house of our God.

135:003 Praise the LORD; for the LORD is good: sing praises unto his
        name; for it is pleasant.

135:004 For the LORD hath chosen Jacob unto himself, and Israel for
        his peculiar treasure.

135:005 For I know that the LORD is great, and that our Lord is above
        all gods.

135:006 Whatsoever the LORD pleased, that did he in heaven, and in
        earth, in the seas, and all deep places.

135:007 He causeth the vapours to ascend from the ends of the earth;
        he maketh lightnings for the rain; he bringeth the wind out of
        his treasuries.

135:008 Who smote the firstborn of Egypt, both of man and beast.

135:009 Who sent tokens and wonders into the midst of thee, O Egypt,
        upon Pharaoh, and upon all his servants.

135:010 Who smote great nations, and slew mighty kings;

135:011 Sihon king of the Amorites, and Og king of Bashan, and all the
        kingdoms of Canaan:

135:012 And gave their land for an heritage, an heritage unto Israel
        his people.

135:013 Thy name, O LORD, endureth for ever; and thy memorial, O LORD,
        throughout all generations.

135:014 For the LORD will judge his people, and he will repent himself
        concerning his servants.

135:015 The idols of the heathen are silver and gold, the work of
        men's hands.

135:016 They have mouths, but they speak not; eyes have they, but they
        see not;

135:017 They have ears, but they hear not; neither is there any breath
        in their mouths.

135:018 They that make them are like unto them: so is every one that
        trusteth in them.

135:019 Bless the LORD, O house of Israel: bless the LORD, O house of
        Aaron:

135:020 Bless the LORD, O house of Levi: ye that fear the LORD, bless
        the LORD.

135:021 Blessed be the LORD out of Zion, which dwelleth at Jerusalem.
        Praise ye the LORD.

136:001 O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is good: for his mercy
        endureth for ever.

136:002 O give thanks unto the God of gods: for his mercy endureth for
        ever.

136:003 O give thanks to the Lord of lords: for his mercy endureth for
        ever.

136:004 To him who alone doeth great wonders: for his mercy endureth
        for ever.

136:005 To him that by wisdom made the heavens: for his mercy endureth
        for ever.

136:006 To him that stretched out the earth above the waters: for his
        mercy endureth for ever.

136:007 To him that made great lights: for his mercy endureth for
        ever:

136:008 The sun to rule by day: for his mercy endureth for ever:

136:009 The moon and stars to rule by night: for his mercy endureth
        for ever.

136:010 To him that smote Egypt in their firstborn: for his mercy
        endureth for ever:

136:011 And brought out Israel from among them: for his mercy endureth
        for ever:

136:012 With a strong hand, and with a stretched out arm: for his
        mercy endureth for ever.

136:013 To him which divided the Red sea into parts: for his mercy
        endureth for ever:

136:014 And made Israel to pass through the midst of it: for his mercy
        endureth for ever:

136:015 But overthrew Pharaoh and his host in the Red sea: for his
        mercy endureth for ever.

136:016 To him which led his people through the wilderness: for his
        mercy endureth for ever.

136:017 To him which smote great kings: for his mercy endureth for
        ever:

136:018 And slew famous kings: for his mercy endureth for ever:

136:019 Sihon king of the Amorites: for his mercy endureth for ever:

136:020 And Og the king of Bashan: for his mercy endureth for ever:

136:021 And gave their land for an heritage: for his mercy endureth
        for ever:

136:022 Even an heritage unto Israel his servant: for his mercy
        endureth for ever.

136:023 Who remembered us in our low estate: for his mercy endureth
        for ever:

136:024 And hath redeemed us from our enemies: for his mercy endureth
        for ever.

136:025 Who giveth food to all flesh: for his mercy endureth for ever.

136:026 O give thanks unto the God of heaven: for his mercy endureth
        for ever.

137:001 By the rivers of Babylon, there we sat down, yea, we wept,
        when we remembered Zion.

137:002 We hanged our harps upon the willows in the midst thereof.

137:003 For there they that carried us away captive required of us a
        song; and they that wasted us required of us mirth, saying,
        Sing us one of the songs of Zion.

137:004 How shall we sing the LORD's song in a strange land?

137:005 If I forget thee, O Jerusalem, let my right hand forget her
        cunning.

137:006 If I do not remember thee, let my tongue cleave to the roof of
        my mouth; if I prefer not Jerusalem above my chief joy.

137:007 Remember, O LORD, the children of Edom in the day of
        Jerusalem; who said, Rase it, rase it, even to the foundation
        thereof.

137:008 O daughter of Babylon, who art to be destroyed; happy shall he
        be, that rewardeth thee as thou hast served us.

137:009 Happy shall he be, that taketh and dasheth thy little ones
        against the stones.

138:001 I will praise thee with my whole heart: before the gods will I
        sing praise unto thee.

138:002 I will worship toward thy holy temple, and praise thy name for
        thy lovingkindness and for thy truth: for thou hast magnified
        thy word above all thy name.

138:003 In the day when I cried thou answeredst me, and strengthenedst
        me with strength in my soul.

138:004 All the kings of the earth shall praise thee, O LORD, when
        they hear the words of thy mouth.

138:005 Yea, they shall sing in the ways of the LORD: for great is the
        glory of the LORD.

138:006 Though the LORD be high, yet hath he respect unto the lowly:
        but the proud he knoweth afar off.

138:007 Though I walk in the midst of trouble, thou wilt revive me:
        thou shalt stretch forth thine hand against the wrath of mine
        enemies, and thy right hand shall save me.

138:008 The LORD will perfect that which concerneth me: thy mercy, O
        LORD, endureth for ever: forsake not the works of thine own
        hands.

139:001 O lord, thou hast searched me, and known me.

139:002 Thou knowest my downsitting and mine uprising, thou
        understandest my thought afar off.

139:003 Thou compassest my path and my lying down, and art acquainted
        with all my ways.

139:004 For there is not a word in my tongue, but, lo, O LORD, thou
        knowest it altogether.

139:005 Thou hast beset me behind and before, and laid thine hand upon
        me.

139:006 Such knowledge is too wonderful for me; it is high, I cannot
        attain unto it.

139:007 Whither shall I go from thy spirit? or whither shall I flee
        from thy presence?

139:008 If I ascend up into heaven, thou art there: if I make my bed
        in hell, behold, thou art there.

139:009 If I take the wings of the morning, and dwell in the uttermost
        parts of the sea;

139:010 Even there shall thy hand lead me, and thy right hand shall
        hold me.

139:011 If I say, Surely the darkness shall cover me; even the night
        shall be light about me.

139:012 Yea, the darkness hideth not from thee; but the night shineth
        as the day: the darkness and the light are both alike to thee.

139:013 For thou hast possessed my reins: thou hast covered me in my
        mother's womb.

139:014 I will praise thee; for I am fearfully and wonderfully made:
        marvellous are thy works; and that my soul knoweth right well.

139:015 My substance was not hid from thee, when I was made in secret,
        and curiously wrought in the lowest parts of the earth.

139:016 Thine eyes did see my substance, yet being unperfect; and in
        thy book all my members were written, which in continuance
        were fashioned, when as yet there was none of them.

139:017 How precious also are thy thoughts unto me, O God! how great
        is the sum of them!

139:018 If I should count them, they are more in number than the sand:
        when I awake, I am still with thee.

139:019 Surely thou wilt slay the wicked, O God: depart from me
        therefore, ye bloody men.

139:020 For they speak against thee wickedly, and thine enemies take
        thy name in vain.

139:021 Do not I hate them, O LORD, that hate thee? and am not I
        grieved with those that rise up against thee?

139:022 I hate them with perfect hatred: I count them mine enemies.

139:023 Search me, O God, and know my heart: try me, and know my
        thoughts:

139:024 And see if there be any wicked way in me, and lead me in the
        way everlasting.

140:001 Deliver me, O LORD, from the evil man: preserve me from the
        violent man;

140:002 Which imagine mischiefs in their heart; continually are they
        gathered together for war.

140:003 They have sharpened their tongues like a serpent; adders'
        poison is under their lips. Selah.

140:004 Keep me, O LORD, from the hands of the wicked; preserve me
        from the violent man; who have purposed to overthrow my
        goings.

140:005 The proud have hid a snare for me, and cords; they have spread
        a net by the wayside; they have set gins for me. Selah.

140:006 I said unto the LORD, Thou art my God: hear the voice of my
        supplications, O LORD.

140:007 O GOD the Lord, the strength of my salvation, thou hast
        covered my head in the day of battle.

140:008 Grant not, O LORD, the desires of the wicked: further not his
        wicked device; lest they exalt themselves. Selah.

140:009 As for the head of those that compass me about, let the
        mischief of their own lips cover them.

140:010 Let burning coals fall upon them: let them be cast into the
        fire; into deep pits, that they rise not up again.

140:011 Let not an evil speaker be established in the earth: evil
        shall hunt the violent man to overthrow him.

140:012 I know that the LORD will maintain the cause of the afflicted,
        and the right of the poor.

140:013 Surely the righteous shall give thanks unto thy name: the
        upright shall dwell in thy presence.

141:001 Lord, I cry unto thee: make haste unto me; give ear unto my
        voice, when I cry unto thee.

141:002 Let my prayer be set forth before thee as incense; and the
        lifting up of my hands as the evening sacrifice.

141:003 Set a watch, O LORD, before my mouth; keep the door of my
        lips.

141:004 Incline not my heart to any evil thing, to practise wicked
        works with men that work iniquity: and let me not eat of their
        dainties.

141:005 Let the righteous smite me; it shall be a kindness: and let
        him reprove me; it shall be an excellent oil, which shall not
        break my head: for yet my prayer also shall be in their
        calamities.

141:006 When their judges are overthrown in stony places, they shall
        hear my words; for they are sweet.

141:007 Our bones are scattered at the grave's mouth, as when one
        cutteth and cleaveth wood upon the earth.

141:008 But mine eyes are unto thee, O GOD the Lord: in thee is my
        trust; leave not my soul destitute.

141:009 Keep me from the snares which they have laid for me, and the
        gins of the workers of iniquity.

141:010 Let the wicked fall into their own nets, whilst that I withal
        escape.

142:001 I cried unto the LORD with my voice; with my voice unto the
        LORD did I make my supplication.

142:002 I poured out my complaint before him; I shewed before him my
        trouble.

142:003 When my spirit was overwhelmed within me, then thou knewest my
        path. In the way wherein I walked have they privily laid a
        snare for me.

142:004 I looked on my right hand, and beheld, but there was no man
        that would know me: refuge failed me; no man cared for my
        soul.

142:005 I cried unto thee, O LORD: I said, Thou art my refuge and my
        portion in the land of the living.

142:006 Attend unto my cry; for I am brought very low: deliver me from
        my persecutors; for they are stronger than I.

142:007 Bring my soul out of prison, that I may praise thy name: the
        righteous shall compass me about; for thou shalt deal
        bountifully with me.

143:001 Hear my prayer, O LORD, give ear to my supplications: in thy
        faithfulness answer me, and in thy righteousness.

143:002 And enter not into judgment with thy servant: for in thy sight
        shall no man living be justified.

143:003 For the enemy hath persecuted my soul; he hath smitten my life
        down to the ground; he hath made me to dwell in darkness, as
        those that have been long dead.

143:004 Therefore is my spirit overwhelmed within me; my heart within
        me is desolate.

143:005 I remember the days of old; I meditate on all thy works; I
        muse on the work of thy hands.

143:006 I stretch forth my hands unto thee: my soul thirsteth after
        thee, as a thirsty land. Selah.

143:007 Hear me speedily, O LORD: my spirit faileth: hide not thy face
        from me, lest I be like unto them that go down into the pit.

143:008 Cause me to hear thy lovingkindness in the morning; for in
        thee do I trust: cause me to know the way wherein I should
        walk; for I lift up my soul unto thee.

143:009 Deliver me, O LORD, from mine enemies: I flee unto thee to
        hide me.

143:010 Teach me to do thy will; for thou art my God: thy spirit is
        good; lead me into the land of uprightness.

143:011 Quicken me, O LORD, for thy name's sake: for thy
        righteousness' sake bring my soul out of trouble.

143:012 And of thy mercy cut off mine enemies, and destroy all them
        that afflict my soul: for I am thy servant.

144:001 Blessed be the LORD my strength which teacheth my hands to
        war, and my fingers to fight:

144:002 My goodness, and my fortress; my high tower, and my deliverer;
        my shield, and he in whom I trust; who subdueth my people
        under me.

144:003 LORD, what is man, that thou takest knowledge of him! or the
        son of man, that thou makest account of him!

144:004 Man is like to vanity: his days are as a shadow that passeth
        away.

144:005 Bow thy heavens, O LORD, and come down: touch the mountains,
        and they shall smoke.

144:006 Cast forth lightning, and scatter them: shoot out thine
        arrows, and destroy them.

144:007 Send thine hand from above; rid me, and deliver me out of
        great waters, from the hand of strange children;

144:008 Whose mouth speaketh vanity, and their right hand is a right
        hand of falsehood.

144:009 I will sing a new song unto thee, O God: upon a psaltery and
        an instrument of ten strings will I sing praises unto thee.

144:010 It is he that giveth salvation unto kings: who delivereth
        David his servant from the hurtful sword.

144:011 Rid me, and deliver me from the hand of strange children,
        whose mouth speaketh vanity, and their right hand is a right
        hand of falsehood:

144:012 That our sons may be as plants grown up in their youth; that
        our daughters may be as corner stones, polished after the
        similitude of a palace:

144:013 That our garners may be full, affording all manner of store:
        that our sheep may bring forth thousands and ten thousands in
        our streets:

144:014 That our oxen may be strong to labour; that there be no
        breaking in, nor going out; that there be no complaining in
        our streets.

144:015 Happy is that people, that is in such a case: yea, happy is
        that people, whose God is the LORD.

145:001 I will extol thee, my God, O king; and I will bless thy name
        for ever and ever.

145:002 Every day will I bless thee; and I will praise thy name for
        ever and ever.

145:003 Great is the LORD, and greatly to be praised; and his
        greatness is unsearchable.

145:004 One generation shall praise thy works to another, and shall
        declare thy mighty acts.

145:005 I will speak of the glorious honour of thy majesty, and of thy
        wondrous works.

145:006 And men shall speak of the might of thy terrible acts: and I
        will declare thy greatness.

145:007 They shall abundantly utter the memory of thy great goodness,
        and shall sing of thy righteousness.

145:008 The LORD is gracious, and full of compassion; slow to anger,
        and of great mercy.

145:009 The LORD is good to all: and his tender mercies are over all
        his works.

145:010 All thy works shall praise thee, O LORD; and thy saints shall
        bless thee.

145:011 They shall speak of the glory of thy kingdom, and talk of thy
        power;

145:012 To make known to the sons of men his mighty acts, and the
        glorious majesty of his kingdom.

145:013 Thy kingdom is an everlasting kingdom, and thy dominion
        endureth throughout all generations.

145:014 The LORD upholdeth all that fall, and raiseth up all those
        that be bowed down.

145:015 The eyes of all wait upon thee; and thou givest them their
        meat in due season.

145:016 Thou openest thine hand, and satisfiest the desire of every
        living thing.

145:017 The LORD is righteous in all his ways, and holy in all his
        works.

145:018 The LORD is nigh unto all them that call upon him, to all that
        call upon him in truth.

145:019 He will fulfil the desire of them that fear him: he also will
        hear their cry, and will save them.

145:020 The LORD preserveth all them that love him: but all the wicked
        will he destroy.

145:021 My mouth shall speak the praise of the LORD: and let all flesh
        bless his holy name for ever and ever.

146:001 Praise ye the LORD. Praise the LORD, O my soul.

146:002 While I live will I praise the LORD: I will sing praises unto
        my God while I have any being.

146:003 Put not your trust in princes, nor in the son of man, in whom
        there is no help.

146:004 His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth; in that
        very day his thoughts perish.

146:005 Happy is he that hath the God of Jacob for his help, whose
        hope is in the LORD his God:

146:006 Which made heaven, and earth, the sea, and all that therein
        is: which keepeth truth for ever:

146:007 Which executeth judgment for the oppressed: which giveth food
        to the hungry. The LORD looseth the prisoners:

146:008 The LORD openeth the eyes of the blind: the LORD raiseth them
        that are bowed down: the LORD loveth the righteous:

146:009 The LORD preserveth the strangers; he relieveth the fatherless
        and widow: but the way of the wicked he turneth upside down.

146:010 The LORD shall reign for ever, even thy God, O Zion, unto all
        generations. Praise ye the LORD.

147:001 Praise ye the LORD: for it is good to sing praises unto our
        God; for it is pleasant; and praise is comely.

147:002 The LORD doth build up Jerusalem: he gathereth together the
        outcasts of Israel.

147:003 He healeth the broken in heart, and bindeth up their wounds.

147:004 He telleth the number of the stars; he calleth them all by
        their names.

147:005 Great is our Lord, and of great power: his understanding is
        infinite.

147:006 The LORD lifteth up the meek: he casteth the wicked down to
        the ground.

147:007 Sing unto the LORD with thanksgiving; sing praise upon the
        harp unto our God:

147:008 Who covereth the heaven with clouds, who prepareth rain for
        the earth, who maketh grass to grow upon the mountains.

147:009 He giveth to the beast his food, and to the young ravens which
        cry.

147:010 He delighteth not in the strength of the horse: he taketh not
        pleasure in the legs of a man.

147:011 The LORD taketh pleasure in them that fear him, in those that
        hope in his mercy.

147:012 Praise the LORD, O Jerusalem; praise thy God, O Zion.

147:013 For he hath strengthened the bars of thy gates; he hath
        blessed thy children within thee.

147:014 He maketh peace in thy borders, and filleth thee with the
        finest of the wheat.

147:015 He sendeth forth his commandment upon earth: his word runneth
        very swiftly.

147:016 He giveth snow like wool: he scattereth the hoarfrost like
        ashes.

147:017 He casteth forth his ice like morsels: who can stand before
        his cold?

147:018 He sendeth out his word, and melteth them: he causeth his wind
        to blow, and the waters flow.

147:019 He sheweth his word unto Jacob, his statutes and his judgments
        unto Israel.

147:020 He hath not dealt so with any nation: and as for his
        judgments, they have not known them. Praise ye the LORD.

148:001 Praise ye the LORD. Praise ye the LORD from the heavens:
        praise him in the heights.

148:002 Praise ye him, all his angels: praise ye him, all his hosts.

148:003 Praise ye him, sun and moon: praise him, all ye stars of
        light.

148:004 Praise him, ye heavens of heavens, and ye waters that be above
        the heavens.

148:005 Let them praise the name of the LORD: for he commanded, and
        they were created.

148:006 He hath also stablished them for ever and ever: he hath made a
        decree which shall not pass.

148:007 Praise the LORD from the earth, ye dragons, and all deeps:

148:008 Fire, and hail; snow, and vapours; stormy wind fulfilling his
        word:

148:009 Mountains, and all hills; fruitful trees, and all cedars:

148:010 Beasts, and all cattle; creeping things, and flying fowl:

148:011 Kings of the earth, and all people; princes, and all judges of
        the earth:

148:012 Both young men, and maidens; old men, and children:

148:013 Let them praise the name of the LORD: for his name alone is
        excellent; his glory is above the earth and heaven.

148:014 He also exalteth the horn of his people, the praise of all his
        saints; even of the children of Israel, a people near unto
        him. Praise ye the LORD.

149:001 Praise ye the LORD. Sing unto the LORD a new song, and his
        praise in the congregation of saints.

149:002 Let Israel rejoice in him that made him: let the children of
        Zion be joyful in their King.

149:003 Let them praise his name in the dance: let them sing praises
        unto him with the timbrel and harp.

149:004 For the LORD taketh pleasure in his people: he will beautify
        the meek with salvation.

149:005 Let the saints be joyful in glory: let them sing aloud upon
        their beds.

149:006 Let the high praises of God be in their mouth, and a two-edged
        sword in their hand;

149:007 To execute vengeance upon the heathen, and punishments upon
        the people;

149:008 To bind their kings with chains, and their nobles with fetters
        of iron;

149:009 To execute upon them the judgment written: this honour have
        all his saints. Praise ye the LORD.

150:001 Praise ye the LORD. Praise God in his sanctuary: praise him in
        the firmament of his power.

150:002 Praise him for his mighty acts: praise him according to his
        excellent greatness.

150:003 Praise him with the sound of the trumpet: praise him with the
        psaltery and harp.

150:004 Praise him with the timbrel and dance: praise him with
        stringed instruments and organs.

150:005 Praise him upon the loud cymbals: praise him upon the high
        sounding cymbals.

150:006 Let every thing that hath breath praise the LORD. Praise ye
        the LORD.

Book 20	Proverbs

001:001 The proverbs of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel;

001:002 To know wisdom and instruction; to perceive the words of
        understanding;

001:003 To receive the instruction of wisdom, justice, and judgment,
        and equity;

001:004 To give subtilty to the simple, to the young man knowledge and
        discretion.

001:005 A wise man will hear, and will increase learning; and a man of
        understanding shall attain unto wise counsels:

001:006 To understand a proverb, and the interpretation; the words of
        the wise, and their dark sayings.

001:007 The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge: but fools
        despise wisdom and instruction.

001:008 My son, hear the instruction of thy father, and forsake not
        the law of thy mother:

001:009 For they shall be an ornament of grace unto thy head, and
        chains about thy neck.

001:010 My son, if sinners entice thee, consent thou not.

001:011 If they say, Come with us, let us lay wait for blood, let us
        lurk privily for the innocent without cause:

001:012 Let us swallow them up alive as the grave; and whole, as those
        that go down into the pit:

001:013 We shall find all precious substance, we shall fill our houses
        with spoil:

001:014 Cast in thy lot among us; let us all have one purse:

001:015 My son, walk not thou in the way with them; refrain thy foot
        from their path:

001:016 For their feet run to evil, and make haste to shed blood.

001:017 Surely in vain the net is spread in the sight of any bird.

001:018 And they lay wait for their own blood; they lurk privily for
        their own lives.

001:019 So are the ways of every one that is greedy of gain; which
        taketh away the life of the owners thereof.

001:020 Wisdom crieth without; she uttereth her voice in the streets:

001:021 She crieth in the chief place of concourse, in the openings of
        the gates: in the city she uttereth her words, saying,

001:022 How long, ye simple ones, will ye love simplicity? and the
        scorners delight in their scorning, and fools hate knowledge?

001:023 Turn you at my reproof: behold, I will pour out my spirit unto
        you, I will make known my words unto you.

001:024 Because I have called, and ye refused; I have stretched out my
        hand, and no man regarded;

001:025 But ye have set at nought all my counsel, and would none of my
        reproof:

001:026 I also will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when your fear
        cometh;

001:027 When your fear cometh as desolation, and your destruction
        cometh as a whirlwind; when distress and anguish cometh upon
        you.

001:028 Then shall they call upon me, but I will not answer; they
        shall seek me early, but they shall not find me:

001:029 For that they hated knowledge, and did not choose the fear of
        the LORD:

001:030 They would none of my counsel: they despised all my reproof.

001:031 Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way, and be
        filled with their own devices.

001:032 For the turning away of the simple shall slay them, and the
        prosperity of fools shall destroy them.

001:033 But whoso hearkeneth unto me shall dwell safely, and shall be
        quiet from fear of evil.

002:001 My son, if thou wilt receive my words, and hide my
        commandments with thee;

002:002 So that thou incline thine ear unto wisdom, and apply thine
        heart to understanding;

002:003 Yea, if thou criest after knowledge, and liftest up thy voice
        for understanding;

002:004 If thou seekest her as silver, and searchest for her as for
        hid treasures;

002:005 Then shalt thou understand the fear of the LORD, and find the
        knowledge of God.

002:006 For the LORD giveth wisdom: out of his mouth cometh knowledge
        and understanding.

002:007 He layeth up sound wisdom for the righteous: he is a buckler
        to them that walk uprightly.

002:008 He keepeth the paths of judgment, and preserveth the way of
        his saints.

002:009 Then shalt thou understand righteousness, and judgment, and
        equity; yea, every good path.

002:010 When wisdom entereth into thine heart, and knowledge is
        pleasant unto thy soul;

002:011 Discretion shall preserve thee, understanding shall keep thee:

002:012 To deliver thee from the way of the evil man, from the man
        that speaketh froward things;

002:013 Who leave the paths of uprightness, to walk in the ways of
        darkness;

002:014 Who rejoice to do evil, and delight in the frowardness of the
        wicked;

002:015 Whose ways are crooked, and they froward in their paths:

002:016 To deliver thee from the strange woman, even from the stranger
        which flattereth with her words;

002:017 Which forsaketh the guide of her youth, and forgetteth the
        covenant of her God.

002:018 For her house inclineth unto death, and her paths unto the
        dead.

002:019 None that go unto her return again, neither take they hold of
        the paths of life.

002:020 That thou mayest walk in the way of good men, and keep the
        paths of the righteous.

002:021 For the upright shall dwell in the land, and the perfect shall
        remain in it.

002:022 But the wicked shall be cut off from the earth, and the
        transgressors shall be rooted out of it.

003:001 My son, forget not my law; but let thine heart keep my
        commandments:

003:002 For length of days, and long life, and peace, shall they add
        to thee.

003:003 Let not mercy and truth forsake thee: bind them about thy
        neck; write them upon the table of thine heart:

003:004 So shalt thou find favour and good understanding in the sight
        of God and man.

003:005 Trust in the LORD with all thine heart; and lean not unto
        thine own understanding.

003:006 In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy
        paths.

003:007 Be not wise in thine own eyes: fear the LORD, and depart from
        evil.

003:008 It shall be health to thy navel, and marrow to thy bones.

003:009 Honour the LORD with thy substance, and with the firstfruits
        of all thine increase:

003:010 So shall thy barns be filled with plenty, and thy presses
        shall burst out with new wine.

003:011 My son, despise not the chastening of the LORD; neither be
        weary of his correction:

003:012 For whom the LORD loveth he correcteth; even as a father the
        son in whom he delighteth.

003:013 Happy is the man that findeth wisdom, and the man that getteth
        understanding.

003:014 For the merchandise of it is better than the merchandise of
        silver, and the gain thereof than fine gold.

003:015 She is more precious than rubies: and all the things thou
        canst desire are not to be compared unto her.

003:016 Length of days is in her right hand; and in her left hand
        riches and honour.

003:017 Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are
        peace.

003:018 She is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her: and
        happy is every one that retaineth her.

003:019 The LORD by wisdom hath founded the earth; by understanding
        hath he established the heavens.

003:020 By his knowledge the depths are broken up, and the clouds drop
        down the dew.

003:021 My son, let not them depart from thine eyes: keep sound wisdom
        and discretion:

003:022 So shall they be life unto thy soul, and grace to thy neck.

003:023 Then shalt thou walk in thy way safely, and thy foot shall not
        stumble.

003:024 When thou liest down, thou shalt not be afraid: yea, thou
        shalt lie down, and thy sleep shall be sweet.

003:025 Be not afraid of sudden fear, neither of the desolation of the
        wicked, when it cometh.

003:026 For the LORD shall be thy confidence, and shall keep thy foot
        from being taken.

003:027 Withhold not good from them to whom it is due, when it is in
        the power of thine hand to do it.

003:028 Say not unto thy neighbour, Go, and come again, and to morrow
        I will give; when thou hast it by thee.

003:029 Devise not evil against thy neighbour, seeing he dwelleth
        securely by thee.

003:030 Strive not with a man without cause, if he have done thee no
        harm.

003:031 Envy thou not the oppressor, and choose none of his ways.

003:032 For the froward is abomination to the LORD: but his secret is
        with the righteous.

003:033 The curse of the LORD is in the house of the wicked: but he
        blesseth the habitation of the just.

003:034 Surely he scorneth the scorners: but he giveth grace unto the
        lowly.

003:035 The wise shall inherit glory: but shame shall be the promotion
        of fools.

004:001 Hear, ye children, the instruction of a father, and attend to
        know understanding.

004:002 For I give you good doctrine, forsake ye not my law.

004:003 For I was my father's son, tender and only beloved in the
        sight of my mother.

004:004 He taught me also, and said unto me, Let thine heart retain my
        words: keep my commandments, and live.

004:005 Get wisdom, get understanding: forget it not; neither decline
        from the words of my mouth.

004:006 Forsake her not, and she shall preserve thee: love her, and
        she shall keep thee.

004:007 Wisdom is the principal thing; therefore get wisdom: and with
        all thy getting get understanding.

004:008 Exalt her, and she shall promote thee: she shall bring thee to
        honour, when thou dost embrace her.

004:009 She shall give to thine head an ornament of grace: a crown of
        glory shall she deliver to thee.

004:010 Hear, O my son, and receive my sayings; and the years of thy
        life shall be many.

004:011 I have taught thee in the way of wisdom; I have led thee in
        right paths.

004:012 When thou goest, thy steps shall not be straitened; and when
        thou runnest, thou shalt not stumble.

004:013 Take fast hold of instruction; let her not go: keep her; for
        she is thy life.

004:014 Enter not into the path of the wicked, and go not in the way
        of evil men.

004:015 Avoid it, pass not by it, turn from it, and pass away.

004:016 For they sleep not, except they have done mischief; and their
        sleep is taken away, unless they cause some to fall.

004:017 For they eat the bread of wickedness, and drink the wine of
        violence.

004:018 But the path of the just is as the shining light, that shineth
        more and more unto the perfect day.

004:019 The way of the wicked is as darkness: they know not at what
        they stumble.

004:020 My son, attend to my words; incline thine ear unto my sayings.

004:021 Let them not depart from thine eyes; keep them in the midst of
        thine heart.

004:022 For they are life unto those that find them, and health to all
        their flesh.

004:023 Keep thy heart with all diligence; for out of it are the
        issues of life.

004:024 Put away from thee a froward mouth, and perverse lips put far
        from thee.

004:025 Let thine eyes look right on, and let thine eyelids look
        straight before thee.

004:026 Ponder the path of thy feet, and let all thy ways be
        established.

004:027 Turn not to the right hand nor to the left: remove thy foot
        from evil.

005:001 My son, attend unto my wisdom, and bow thine ear to my
        understanding:

005:002 That thou mayest regard discretion, and that thy lips may keep
        knowledge.

005:003 For the lips of a strange woman drop as an honeycomb, and her
        mouth is smoother than oil:

005:004 But her end is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a two-edged sword.

005:005 Her feet go down to death; her steps take hold on hell.

005:006 Lest thou shouldest ponder the path of life, her ways are
        moveable, that thou canst not know them.

005:007 Hear me now therefore, O ye children, and depart not from the
        words of my mouth.

005:008 Remove thy way far from her, and come not nigh the door of her
        house:

005:009 Lest thou give thine honour unto others, and thy years unto
        the cruel:

005:010 Lest strangers be filled with thy wealth; and thy labours be
        in the house of a stranger;

005:011 And thou mourn at the last, when thy flesh and thy body are
        consumed,

005:012 And say, How have I hated instruction, and my heart despised
        reproof;

005:013 And have not obeyed the voice of my teachers, nor inclined
        mine ear to them that instructed me!

005:014 I was almost in all evil in the midst of the congregation and
        assembly.

005:015 Drink waters out of thine own cistern, and running waters out
        of thine own well.

005:016 Let thy fountains be dispersed abroad, and rivers of waters in
        the streets.

005:017 Let them be only thine own, and not strangers' with thee.

005:018 Let thy fountain be blessed: and rejoice with the wife of thy
        youth.

005:019 Let her be as the loving hind and pleasant roe; let her
        breasts satisfy thee at all times; and be thou ravished always
        with her love.

005:020 And why wilt thou, my son, be ravished with a strange woman,
        and embrace the bosom of a stranger?

005:021 For the ways of man are before the eyes of the LORD, and he
        pondereth all his goings.

005:022 His own iniquities shall take the wicked himself, and he shall
        be holden with the cords of his sins.

005:023 He shall die without instruction; and in the greatness of his
        folly he shall go astray.

006:001 My son, if thou be surety for thy friend, if thou hast
        stricken thy hand with a stranger,

006:002 Thou art snared with the words of thy mouth, thou art taken
        with the words of thy mouth.

006:003 Do this now, my son, and deliver thyself, when thou art come
        into the hand of thy friend; go, humble thyself, and make sure
        thy friend.

006:004 Give not sleep to thine eyes, nor slumber to thine eyelids.

006:005 Deliver thyself as a roe from the hand of the hunter, and as a
        bird from the hand of the fowler.

006:006 Go to the ant, thou sluggard; consider her ways, and be wise:

006:007 Which having no guide, overseer, or ruler,

006:008 Provideth her meat in the summer, and gathereth her food in
        the harvest.

006:009 How long wilt thou sleep, O sluggard? when wilt thou arise out
        of thy sleep?

006:010 Yet a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the
        hands to sleep:

006:011 So shall thy poverty come as one that travelleth, and thy want
        as an armed man.

006:012 A naughty person, a wicked man, walketh with a froward mouth.

006:013 He winketh with his eyes, he speaketh with his feet, he
        teacheth with his fingers;

006:014 Frowardness is in his heart, he deviseth mischief continually;
        he soweth discord.

006:015 Therefore shall his calamity come suddenly; suddenly shall he
        be broken without remedy.

006:016 These six things doth the LORD hate: yea, seven are an
        abomination unto him:

006:017 A proud look, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent
        blood,

006:018 An heart that deviseth wicked imaginations, feet that be swift
        in running to mischief,

006:019 A false witness that speaketh lies, and he that soweth discord
        among brethren.

006:020 My son, keep thy father's commandment, and forsake not the law
        of thy mother:

006:021 Bind them continually upon thine heart, and tie them about thy
        neck.

006:022 When thou goest, it shall lead thee; when thou sleepest, it
        shall keep thee; and when thou awakest, it shall talk with
        thee.

006:023 For the commandment is a lamp; and the law is light; and
        reproofs of instruction are the way of life:

006:024 To keep thee from the evil woman, from the flattery of the
        tongue of a strange woman.

006:025 Lust not after her beauty in thine heart; neither let her take
        thee with her eyelids.

006:026 For by means of a whorish woman a man is brought to a piece of
        bread: and the adultress will hunt for the precious life.

006:027 Can a man take fire in his bosom, and his clothes not be
        burned?

006:028 Can one go upon hot coals, and his feet not be burned?

006:029 So he that goeth in to his neighbour's wife; whosoever
        toucheth her shall not be innocent.

006:030 Men do not despise a thief, if he steal to satisfy his soul
        when he is hungry;

006:031 But if he be found, he shall restore sevenfold; he shall give
        all the substance of his house.

006:032 But whoso committeth adultery with a woman lacketh
        understanding: he that doeth it destroyeth his own soul.

006:033 A wound and dishonour shall he get; and his reproach shall not
        be wiped away.

006:034 For jealousy is the rage of a man: therefore he will not spare
        in the day of vengeance.

006:035 He will not regard any ransom; neither will he rest content,
        though thou givest many gifts.

007:001 My son, keep my words, and lay up my commandments with thee.

007:002 Keep my commandments, and live; and my law as the apple of
        thine eye.

007:003 Bind them upon thy fingers, write them upon the table of thine
        heart.

007:004 Say unto wisdom, Thou art my sister; and call understanding
        thy kinswoman:

007:005 That they may keep thee from the strange woman, from the
        stranger which flattereth with her words.

007:006 For at the window of my house I looked through my casement,

007:007 And beheld among the simple ones, I discerned among the
        youths, a young man void of understanding,

007:008 Passing through the street near her corner; and he went the
        way to her house,

007:009 In the twilight, in the evening, in the black and dark night:

007:010 And, behold, there met him a woman with the attire of an
        harlot, and subtil of heart.

007:011 (She is loud and stubborn; her feet abide not in her house:

007:012 Now is she without, now in the streets, and lieth in wait at
        every corner.)

007:013 So she caught him, and kissed him, and with an impudent face
        said unto him,

007:014 I have peace offerings with me; this day have I payed my vows.

007:015 Therefore came I forth to meet thee, diligently to seek thy
        face, and I have found thee.

007:016 I have decked my bed with coverings of tapestry, with carved
        works, with fine linen of Egypt.

007:017 I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.

007:018 Come, let us take our fill of love until the morning: let us
        solace ourselves with loves.

007:019 For the goodman is not at home, he is gone a long journey:

007:020 He hath taken a bag of money with him, and will come home at
        the day appointed.

007:021 With her much fair speech she caused him to yield, with the
        flattering of her lips she forced him.

007:022 He goeth after her straightway, as an ox goeth to the
        slaughter, or as a fool to the correction of the stocks;

007:023 Till a dart strike through his liver; as a bird hasteth to the
        snare, and knoweth not that it is for his life.

007:024 Hearken unto me now therefore, O ye children, and attend to
        the words of my mouth.

007:025 Let not thine heart decline to her ways, go not astray in her
        paths.

007:026 For she hath cast down many wounded: yea, many strong men have
        been slain by her.

007:027 Her house is the way to hell, going down to the chambers of
        death.

008:001 Doth not wisdom cry? and understanding put forth her voice?

008:002 She standeth in the top of high places, by the way in the
        places of the paths.

008:003 She crieth at the gates, at the entry of the city, at the
        coming in at the doors.

008:004 Unto you, O men, I call; and my voice is to the sons of man.

008:005 O ye simple, understand wisdom: and, ye fools, be ye of an
        understanding heart.

008:006 Hear; for I will speak of excellent things; and the opening of
        my lips shall be right things.

008:007 For my mouth shall speak truth; and wickedness is an
        abomination to my lips.

008:008 All the words of my mouth are in righteousness; there is
        nothing froward or perverse in them.

008:009 They are all plain to him that understandeth, and right to
        them that find knowledge.

008:010 Receive my instruction, and not silver; and knowledge rather
        than choice gold.

008:011 For wisdom is better than rubies; and all the things that may
        be desired are not to be compared to it.

008:012 I wisdom dwell with prudence, and find out knowledge of witty
        inventions.

008:013 The fear of the LORD is to hate evil: pride, and arrogancy,
        and the evil way, and the froward mouth, do I hate.

008:014 Counsel is mine, and sound wisdom: I am understanding; I have
        strength.

008:015 By me kings reign, and princes decree justice.

008:016 By me princes rule, and nobles, even all the judges of the
        earth.

008:017 I love them that love me; and those that seek me early shall
        find me.

008:018 Riches and honour are with me; yea, durable riches and
        righteousness.

008:019 My fruit is better than gold, yea, than fine gold; and my
        revenue than choice silver.

008:020 I lead in the way of righteousness, in the midst of the paths
        of judgment:

008:021 That I may cause those that love me to inherit substance; and
        I will fill their treasures.

008:022 The LORD possessed me in the beginning of his way, before his
        works of old.

008:023 I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning, or ever the
        earth was.

008:024 When there were no depths, I was brought forth; when there
        were no fountains abounding with water.

008:025 Before the mountains were settled, before the hills was I
        brought forth:

008:026 While as yet he had not made the earth, nor the fields, nor
        the highest part of the dust of the world.

008:027 When he prepared the heavens, I was there: when he set a
        compass upon the face of the depth:

008:028 When he established the clouds above: when he strengthened the
        fountains of the deep:

008:029 When he gave to the sea his decree, that the waters should not
        pass his commandment: when he appointed the foundations of the
        earth:

008:030 Then I was by him, as one brought up with him: and I was daily
        his delight, rejoicing always before him;

008:031 Rejoicing in the habitable part of his earth; and my delights
        were with the sons of men.

008:032 Now therefore hearken unto me, O ye children: for blessed are
        they that keep my ways.

008:033 Hear instruction, and be wise, and refuse it not.

008:034 Blessed is the man that heareth me, watching daily at my
        gates, waiting at the posts of my doors.

008:035 For whoso findeth me findeth life, and shall obtain favour of
        the LORD.

008:036 But he that sinneth against me wrongeth his own soul: all they
        that hate me love death.

009:001 Wisdom hath builded her house, she hath hewn out her seven
        pillars:

009:002 She hath killed her beasts; she hath mingled her wine; she
        hath also furnished her table.

009:003 She hath sent forth her maidens: she crieth upon the highest
        places of the city,

009:004 Whoso is simple, let him turn in hither: as for him that
        wanteth understanding, she saith to him,

009:005 Come, eat of my bread, and drink of the wine which I have
        mingled.

009:006 Forsake the foolish, and live; and go in the way of
        understanding.

009:007 He that reproveth a scorner getteth to himself shame: and he
        that rebuketh a wicked man getteth himself a blot.

009:008 Reprove not a scorner, lest he hate thee: rebuke a wise man,
        and he will love thee.

009:009 Give instruction to a wise man, and he will be yet wiser:
        teach a just man, and he will increase in learning.

009:010 The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom: and the
        knowledge of the holy is understanding.

009:011 For by me thy days shall be multiplied, and the years of thy
        life shall be increased.

009:012 If thou be wise, thou shalt be wise for thyself: but if thou
        scornest, thou alone shalt bear it.

009:013 A foolish woman is clamorous: she is simple, and knoweth
        nothing.

009:014 For she sitteth at the door of her house, on a seat in the
        high places of the city,

009:015 To call passengers who go right on their ways:

009:016 Whoso is simple, let him turn in hither: and as for him that
        wanteth understanding, she saith to him,

009:017 Stolen waters are sweet, and bread eaten in secret is
        pleasant.

009:018 But he knoweth not that the dead are there; and that her
        guests are in the depths of hell.

010:001 The proverbs of Solomon. A wise son maketh a glad father: but
        a foolish son is the heaviness of his mother.

010:002 Treasures of wickedness profit nothing: but righteousness
        delivereth from death.

010:003 The LORD will not suffer the soul of the righteous to famish:
        but he casteth away the substance of the wicked.

010:004 He becometh poor that dealeth with a slack hand: but the hand
        of the diligent maketh rich.

010:005 He that gathereth in summer is a wise son: but he that
        sleepeth in harvest is a son that causeth shame.

010:006 Blessings are upon the head of the just: but violence covereth
        the mouth of the wicked.

010:007 The memory of the just is blessed: but the name of the wicked
        shall rot.

010:008 The wise in heart will receive commandments: but a prating
        fool shall fall.

010:009 He that walketh uprightly walketh surely: but he that
        perverteth his ways shall be known.

010:010 He that winketh with the eye causeth sorrow: but a prating
        fool shall fall.

010:011 The mouth of a righteous man is a well of life: but violence
        covereth the mouth of the wicked.

010:012 Hatred stirreth up strifes: but love covereth all sins.

010:013 In the lips of him that hath understanding wisdom is found:
        but a rod is for the back of him that is void of
        understanding.

010:014 Wise men lay up knowledge: but the mouth of the foolish is
        near destruction.

010:015 The rich man's wealth is his strong city: the destruction of
        the poor is their poverty.

010:016 The labour of the righteous tendeth to life: the fruit of the
        wicked to sin.

010:017 He is in the way of life that keepeth instruction: but he that
        refuseth reproof erreth.

010:018 He that hideth hatred with lying lips, and he that uttereth a
        slander, is a fool.

010:019 In the multitude of words there wanteth not sin: but he that
        refraineth his lips is wise.

010:020 The tongue of the just is as choice silver: the heart of the
        wicked is little worth.

010:021 The lips of the righteous feed many: but fools die for want of
        wisdom.

010:022 The blessing of the LORD, it maketh rich, and he addeth no
        sorrow with it.

010:023 It is as sport to a fool to do mischief: but a man of
        understanding hath wisdom.

010:024 The fear of the wicked, it shall come upon him: but the desire
        of the righteous shall be granted.

010:025 As the whirlwind passeth, so is the wicked no more: but the
        righteous is an everlasting foundation.

010:026 As vinegar to the teeth, and as smoke to the eyes, so is the
        sluggard to them that send him.

010:027 The fear of the LORD prolongeth days: but the years of the
        wicked shall be shortened.

010:028 The hope of the righteous shall be gladness: but the
        expectation of the wicked shall perish.

010:029 The way of the LORD is strength to the upright: but
        destruction shall be to the workers of iniquity.

010:030 The righteous shall never be removed: but the wicked shall not
        inhabit the earth.

010:031 The mouth of the just bringeth forth wisdom: but the froward
        tongue shall be cut out.

010:032 The lips of the righteous know what is acceptable: but the
        mouth of the wicked speaketh frowardness.

011:001 A false balance is abomination to the LORD: but a just weight
        is his delight.

011:002 When pride cometh, then cometh shame: but with the lowly is
        wisdom.

011:003 The integrity of the upright shall guide them: but the
        perverseness of transgressors shall destroy them.

011:004 Riches profit not in the day of wrath: but righteousness
        delivereth from death.

011:005 The righteousness of the perfect shall direct his way: but the
        wicked shall fall by his own wickedness.

011:006 The righteousness of the upright shall deliver them: but
        transgressors shall be taken in their own naughtiness.

011:007 When a wicked man dieth, his expectation shall perish: and the
        hope of unjust men perisheth.

011:008 The righteous is delivered out of trouble, and the wicked
        cometh in his stead.

011:009 An hypocrite with his mouth destroyeth his neighbour: but
        through knowledge shall the just be delivered.

011:010 When it goeth well with the righteous, the city rejoiceth: and
        when the wicked perish, there is shouting.

011:011 By the blessing of the upright the city is exalted: but it is
        overthrown by the mouth of the wicked.

011:012 He that is void of wisdom despiseth his neighbour: but a man
        of understanding holdeth his peace.

011:013 A talebearer revealeth secrets: but he that is of a faithful
        spirit concealeth the matter.

011:014 Where no counsel is, the people fall: but in the multitude of
        counsellors there is safety.

011:015 He that is surety for a stranger shall smart for it: and he
        that hateth suretiship is sure.

011:016 A gracious woman retaineth honour: and strong men retain
        riches.

011:017 The merciful man doeth good to his own soul: but he that is
        cruel troubleth his own flesh.

011:018 The wicked worketh a deceitful work: but to him that soweth
        righteousness shall be a sure reward.

011:019 As righteousness tendeth to life: so he that pursueth evil
        pursueth it to his own death.

011:020 They that are of a froward heart are abomination to the LORD:
        but such as are upright in their way are his delight.

011:021 Though hand join in hand, the wicked shall not be unpunished:
        but the seed of the righteous shall be delivered.

011:022 As a jewel of gold in a swine's snout, so is a fair woman
        which is without discretion.

011:023 The desire of the righteous is only good: but the expectation
        of the wicked is wrath.

011:024 There is that scattereth, and yet increaseth; and there is
        that withholdeth more than is meet, but it tendeth to poverty.

011:025 The liberal soul shall be made fat: and he that watereth shall
        be watered also himself.

011:026 He that withholdeth corn, the people shall curse him: but
        blessing shall be upon the head of him that selleth it.

011:027 He that diligently seeketh good procureth favour: but he that
        seeketh mischief, it shall come unto him.

011:028 He that trusteth in his riches shall fall; but the righteous
        shall flourish as a branch.

011:029 He that troubleth his own house shall inherit the wind: and
        the fool shall be servant to the wise of heart.

011:030 The fruit of the righteous is a tree of life; and he that
        winneth souls is wise.

011:031 Behold, the righteous shall be recompensed in the earth: much
        more the wicked and the sinner.

012:001 Whoso loveth instruction loveth knowledge: but he that hateth
        reproof is brutish.

012:002 A good man obtaineth favour of the LORD: but a man of wicked
        devices will he condemn.

012:003 A man shall not be established by wickedness: but the root of
        the righteous shall not be moved.

012:004 A virtuous woman is a crown to her husband: but she that
        maketh ashamed is as rottenness in his bones.

012:005 The thoughts of the righteous are right: but the counsels of
        the wicked are deceit.

012:006 The words of the wicked are to lie in wait for blood: but the
        mouth of the upright shall deliver them.

012:007 The wicked are overthrown, and are not: but the house of the
        righteous shall stand.

012:008 A man shall be commended according to his wisdom: but he that
        is of a perverse heart shall be despised.

012:009 He that is despised, and hath a servant, is better than he
        that honoureth himself, and lacketh bread.

012:010 A righteous man regardeth the life of his beast: but the
        tender mercies of the wicked are cruel.

012:011 He that tilleth his land shall be satisfied with bread: but he
        that followeth vain persons is void of understanding.

012:012 The wicked desireth the net of evil men: but the root of the
        righteous yieldeth fruit.

012:013 The wicked is snared by the transgression of his lips: but the
        just shall come out of trouble.

012:014 A man shall be satisfied with good by the fruit of his mouth:
        and the recompence of a man's hands shall be rendered unto
        him.

012:015 The way of a fool is right in his own eyes: but he that
        hearkeneth unto counsel is wise.

012:016 A fool's wrath is presently known: but a prudent man covereth
        shame.

012:017 He that speaketh truth sheweth forth righteousness: but a
        false witness deceit.

012:018 There is that speaketh like the piercings of a sword: but the
        tongue of the wise is health.

012:019 The lip of truth shall be established for ever: but a lying
        tongue is but for a moment.

012:020 Deceit is in the heart of them that imagine evil: but to the
        counsellors of peace is joy.

012:021 There shall no evil happen to the just: but the wicked shall
        be filled with mischief.

012:022 Lying lips are abomination to the LORD: but they that deal
        truly are his delight.

012:023 A prudent man concealeth knowledge: but the heart of fools
        proclaimeth foolishness.

012:024 The hand of the diligent shall bear rule: but the slothful
        shall be under tribute.

012:025 Heaviness in the heart of man maketh it stoop: but a good word
        maketh it glad.

012:026 The righteous is more excellent than his neighbour: but the
        way of the wicked seduceth them.

012:027 The slothful man roasteth not that which he took in hunting:
        but the substance of a diligent man is precious.

012:028 In the way of righteousness is life: and in the pathway
        thereof there is no death.

013:001 A wise son heareth his father's instruction: but a scorner
        heareth not rebuke.

013:002 A man shall eat good by the fruit of his mouth: but the soul
        of the transgressors shall eat violence.

013:003 He that keepeth his mouth keepeth his life: but he that
        openeth wide his lips shall have destruction.

013:004 The soul of the sluggard desireth, and hath nothing: but the
        soul of the diligent shall be made fat.

013:005 A righteous man hateth lying: but a wicked man is loathsome,
        and cometh to shame.

013:006 Righteousness keepeth him that is upright in the way: but
        wickedness overthroweth the sinner.

013:007 There is that maketh himself rich, yet hath nothing: there is
        that maketh himself poor, yet hath great riches.

013:008 The ransom of a man's life are his riches: but the poor
        heareth not rebuke.

013:009 The light of the righteous rejoiceth: but the lamp of the
        wicked shall be put out.

013:010 Only by pride cometh contention: but with the well advised is
        wisdom.

013:011 Wealth gotten by vanity shall be diminished: but he that
        gathereth by labour shall increase.

013:012 Hope deferred maketh the heart sick: but when the desire
        cometh, it is a tree of life.

013:013 Whoso despiseth the word shall be destroyed: but he that
        feareth the commandment shall be rewarded.

013:014 The law of the wise is a fountain of life, to depart from the
        snares of death.

013:015 Good understanding giveth favour: but the way of transgressors
        is hard.

013:016 Every prudent man dealeth with knowledge: but a fool layeth
        open his folly.

013:017 A wicked messenger falleth into mischief: but a faithful
        ambassador is health.

013:018 Poverty and shame shall be to him that refuseth instruction:
        but he that regardeth reproof shall be honoured.

013:019 The desire accomplished is sweet to the soul: but it is
        abomination to fools to depart from evil.

013:020 He that walketh with wise men shall be wise: but a companion
        of fools shall be destroyed.

013:021 Evil pursueth sinners: but to the righteous good shall be
        repayed.

013:022 A good man leaveth an inheritance to his children's children:
        and the wealth of the sinner is laid up for the just.

013:023 Much food is in the tillage of the poor: but there is that is
        destroyed for want of judgment.

013:024 He that spareth his rod hateth his son: but he that loveth him
        chasteneth him betimes.

013:025 The righteous eateth to the satisfying of his soul: but the
        belly of the wicked shall want.

014:001 Every wise woman buildeth her house: but the foolish plucketh
        it down with her hands.

014:002 He that walketh in his uprightness feareth the LORD: but he
        that is perverse in his ways despiseth him.

014:003 In the mouth of the foolish is a rod of pride: but the lips of
        the wise shall preserve them.

014:004 Where no oxen are, the crib is clean: but much increase is by
        the strength of the ox.

014:005 A faithful witness will not lie: but a false witness will
        utter lies.

014:006 A scorner seeketh wisdom, and findeth it not: but knowledge is
        easy unto him that understandeth.

014:007 Go from the presence of a foolish man, when thou perceivest
        not in him the lips of knowledge.

014:008 The wisdom of the prudent is to understand his way: but the
        folly of fools is deceit.

014:009 Fools make a mock at sin: but among the righteous there is
        favour.

014:010 The heart knoweth his own bitterness; and a stranger doth not
        intermeddle with his joy.

014:011 The house of the wicked shall be overthrown: but the
        tabernacle of the upright shall flourish.

014:012 There is a way which seemeth right unto a man, but the end
        thereof are the ways of death.

014:013 Even in laughter the heart is sorrowful; and the end of that
        mirth is heaviness.

014:014 The backslider in heart shall be filled with his own ways: and
        a good man shall be satisfied from himself.

014:015 The simple believeth every word: but the prudent man looketh
        well to his going.

014:016 A wise man feareth, and departeth from evil: but the fool
        rageth, and is confident.

014:017 He that is soon angry dealeth foolishly: and a man of wicked
        devices is hated.

014:018 The simple inherit folly: but the prudent are crowned with
        knowledge.

014:019 The evil bow before the good; and the wicked at the gates of
        the righteous.

014:020 The poor is hated even of his own neighbour: but the rich hath
        many friends.

014:021 He that despiseth his neighbour sinneth: but he that hath
        mercy on the poor, happy is he.

014:022 Do they not err that devise evil? but mercy and truth shall be
        to them that devise good.

014:023 In all labour there is profit: but the talk of the lips
        tendeth only to penury.

014:024 The crown of the wise is their riches: but the foolishness of
        fools is folly.

014:025 A true witness delivereth souls: but a deceitful witness
        speaketh lies.

014:026 In the fear of the LORD is strong confidence: and his children
        shall have a place of refuge.

014:027 The fear of the LORD is a fountain of life, to depart from the
        snares of death.

014:028 In the multitude of people is the king's honour: but in the
        want of people is the destruction of the prince.

014:029 He that is slow to wrath is of great understanding: but he
        that is hasty of spirit exalteth folly.

014:030 A sound heart is the life of the flesh: but envy the
        rottenness of the bones.

014:031 He that oppresseth the poor reproacheth his Maker: but he that
        honoureth him hath mercy on the poor.

014:032 The wicked is driven away in his wickedness: but the righteous
        hath hope in his death.

014:033 Wisdom resteth in the heart of him that hath understanding:
        but that which is in the midst of fools is made known.

014:034 Righteousness exalteth a nation: but sin is a reproach to any
        people.

014:035 The king's favour is toward a wise servant: but his wrath is
        against him that causeth shame.

015:001 A soft answer turneth away wrath: but grievous words stir up
        anger.

015:002 The tongue of the wise useth knowledge aright: but the mouth
        of fools poureth out foolishness.

015:003 The eyes of the LORD are in every place, beholding the evil
        and the good.

015:004 A wholesome tongue is a tree of life: but perverseness therein
        is a breach in the spirit.

015:005 A fool despiseth his father's instruction: but he that
        regardeth reproof is prudent.

015:006 In the house of the righteous is much treasure: but in the
        revenues of the wicked is trouble.

015:007 The lips of the wise disperse knowledge: but the heart of the
        foolish doeth not so.

015:008 The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination to the LORD: but
        the prayer of the upright is his delight.

015:009 The way of the wicked is an abomination unto the LORD: but he
        loveth him that followeth after righteousness.

015:010 Correction is grievous unto him that forsaketh the way: and he
        that hateth reproof shall die.

015:011 Hell and destruction are before the LORD: how much more then
        the hearts of the children of men?

015:012 A scorner loveth not one that reproveth him: neither will he
        go unto the wise.

015:013 A merry heart maketh a cheerful countenance: but by sorrow of
        the heart the spirit is broken.

015:014 The heart of him that hath understanding seeketh knowledge:
        but the mouth of fools feedeth on foolishness.

015:015 All the days of the afflicted are evil: but he that is of a
        merry heart hath a continual feast.

015:016 Better is little with the fear of the LORD than great treasure
        and trouble therewith.

015:017 Better is a dinner of herbs where love is, than a stalled ox
        and hatred therewith.

015:018 A wrathful man stirreth up strife: but he that is slow to
        anger appeaseth strife.

015:019 The way of the slothful man is as an hedge of thorns: but the
        way of the righteous is made plain.

015:020 A wise son maketh a glad father: but a foolish man despiseth
        his mother.

015:021 Folly is joy to him that is destitute of wisdom: but a man of
        understanding walketh uprightly.

015:022 Without counsel purposes are disappointed: but in the
        multitude of counsellors they are established.

015:023 A man hath joy by the answer of his mouth: and a word spoken
        in due season, how good is it!

015:024 The way of life is above to the wise, that he may depart from
        hell beneath.

015:025 The LORD will destroy the house of the proud: but he will
        establish the border of the widow.

015:026 The thoughts of the wicked are an abomination to the LORD: but
        the words of the pure are pleasant words.

015:027 He that is greedy of gain troubleth his own house; but he that
        hateth gifts shall live.

015:028 The heart of the righteous studieth to answer: but the mouth
        of the wicked poureth out evil things.

015:029 The LORD is far from the wicked: but he heareth the prayer of
        the righteous.

015:030 The light of the eyes rejoiceth the heart: and a good report
        maketh the bones fat.

015:031 The ear that heareth the reproof of life abideth among the
        wise.

015:032 He that refuseth instruction despiseth his own soul: but he
        that heareth reproof getteth understanding.

015:033 The fear of the LORD is the instruction of wisdom; and before
        honour is humility.

016:001 The preparations of the heart in man, and the answer of the
        tongue, is from the LORD.

016:002 All the ways of a man are clean in his own eyes; but the LORD
        weigheth the spirits.

016:003 Commit thy works unto the LORD, and thy thoughts shall be
        established.

016:004 The LORD hath made all things for himself: yea, even the
        wicked for the day of evil.

016:005 Every one that is proud in heart is an abomination to the
        LORD: though hand join in hand, he shall not be unpunished.

016:006 By mercy and truth iniquity is purged: and by the fear of the
        LORD men depart from evil.

016:007 When a man's ways please the LORD, he maketh even his enemies
        to be at peace with him.

016:008 Better is a little with righteousness than great revenues
        without right.

016:009 A man's heart deviseth his way: but the LORD directeth his
        steps.

016:010 A divine sentence is in the lips of the king: his mouth
        transgresseth not in judgment.

016:011 A just weight and balance are the LORD's: all the weights of
        the bag are his work.

016:012 It is an abomination to kings to commit wickedness: for the
        throne is established by righteousness.

016:013 Righteous lips are the delight of kings; and they love him
        that speaketh right.

016:014 The wrath of a king is as messengers of death: but a wise man
        will pacify it.

016:015 In the light of the king's countenance is life; and his favour
        is as a cloud of the latter rain.

016:016 How much better is it to get wisdom than gold! and to get
        understanding rather to be chosen than silver!

016:017 The highway of the upright is to depart from evil: he that
        keepeth his way preserveth his soul.

016:018 Pride goeth before destruction, and an haughty spirit before a
        fall.

016:019 Better it is to be of an humble spirit with the lowly, than to
        divide the spoil with the proud.

016:020 He that handleth a matter wisely shall find good: and whoso
        trusteth in the LORD, happy is he.

016:021 The wise in heart shall be called prudent: and the sweetness
        of the lips increaseth learning.

016:022 Understanding is a wellspring of life unto him that hath it:
        but the instruction of fools is folly.

016:023 The heart of the wise teacheth his mouth, and addeth learning
        to his lips.

016:024 Pleasant words are as an honeycomb, sweet to the soul, and
        health to the bones.

016:025 There is a way that seemeth right unto a man, but the end
        thereof are the ways of death.

016:026 He that laboureth laboureth for himself; for his mouth craveth
        it of him.

016:027 An ungodly man diggeth up evil: and in his lips there is as a
        burning fire.

016:028 A froward man soweth strife: and a whisperer separateth chief
        friends.

016:029 A violent man enticeth his neighbour, and leadeth him into the
        way that is not good.

016:030 He shutteth his eyes to devise froward things: moving his lips
        he bringeth evil to pass.

016:031 The hoary head is a crown of glory, if it be found in the way
        of righteousness.

016:032 He that is slow to anger is better than the mighty; and he
        that ruleth his spirit than he that taketh a city.

016:033 The lot is cast into the lap; but the whole disposing thereof
        is of the LORD.

017:001 Better is a dry morsel, and quietness therewith, than an house
        full of sacrifices with strife.

017:002 A wise servant shall have rule over a son that causeth shame,
        and shall have part of the inheritance among the brethren.

017:003 The fining pot is for silver, and the furnace for gold: but
        the LORD trieth the hearts.

017:004 A wicked doer giveth heed to false lips; and a liar giveth ear
        to a naughty tongue.

017:005 Whoso mocketh the poor reproacheth his Maker: and he that is
        glad at calamities shall not be unpunished.

017:006 Children's children are the crown of old men; and the glory of
        children are their fathers.

017:007 Excellent speech becometh not a fool: much less do lying lips
        a prince.

017:008 A gift is as a precious stone in the eyes of him that hath it:
        whithersoever it turneth, it prospereth.

017:009 He that covereth a transgression seeketh love; but he that
        repeateth a matter separateth very friends.

017:010 A reproof entereth more into a wise man than an hundred
        stripes into a fool.

017:011 An evil man seeketh only rebellion: therefore a cruel
        messenger shall be sent against him.

017:012 Let a bear robbed of her whelps meet a man, rather than a fool
        in his folly.

017:013 Whoso rewardeth evil for good, evil shall not depart from his
        house.

017:014 The beginning of strife is as when one letteth out water:
        therefore leave off contention, before it be meddled with.

017:015 He that justifieth the wicked, and he that condemneth the
        just, even they both are abomination to the LORD.

017:016 Wherefore is there a price in the hand of a fool to get
        wisdom, seeing he hath no heart to it?

017:017 A friend loveth at all times, and a brother is born for
        adversity.

017:018 A man void of understanding striketh hands, and becometh
        surety in the presence of his friend.

017:019 He loveth transgression that loveth strife: and he that
        exalteth his gate seeketh destruction.

017:020 He that hath a froward heart findeth no good: and he that hath
        a perverse tongue falleth into mischief.

017:021 He that begetteth a fool doeth it to his sorrow: and the
        father of a fool hath no joy.

017:022 A merry heart doeth good like a medicine: but a broken spirit
        drieth the bones.

017:023 A wicked man taketh a gift out of the bosom to pervert the
        ways of judgment.

017:024 Wisdom is before him that hath understanding; but the eyes of
        a fool are in the ends of the earth.

017:025 A foolish son is a grief to his father, and bitterness to her
        that bare him.

017:026 Also to punish the just is not good, nor to strike princes for
        equity.

017:027 He that hath knowledge spareth his words: and a man of
        understanding is of an excellent spirit.

017:028 Even a fool, when he holdeth his peace, is counted wise: and
        he that shutteth his lips is esteemed a man of understanding.

018:001 Through desire a man, having separated himself, seeketh and
        intermeddleth with all wisdom.

018:002 A fool hath no delight in understanding, but that his heart
        may discover itself.

018:003 When the wicked cometh, then cometh also contempt, and with
        ignominy reproach.

018:004 The words of a man's mouth are as deep waters, and the
        wellspring of wisdom as a flowing brook.

018:005 It is not good to accept the person of the wicked, to
        overthrow the righteous in judgment.

018:006 A fool's lips enter into contention, and his mouth calleth for
        strokes.

018:007 A fool's mouth is his destruction, and his lips are the snare
        of his soul.

018:008 The words of a talebearer are as wounds, and they go down into
        the innermost parts of the belly.

018:009 He also that is slothful in his work is brother to him that is
        a great waster.

018:010 The name of the LORD is a strong tower: the righteous runneth
        into it, and is safe.

018:011 The rich man's wealth is his strong city, and as an high wall
        in his own conceit.

018:012 Before destruction the heart of man is haughty, and before
        honour is humility.

018:013 He that answereth a matter before he heareth it, it is folly
        and shame unto him.

018:014 The spirit of a man will sustain his infirmity; but a wounded
        spirit who can bear?

018:015 The heart of the prudent getteth knowledge; and the ear of the
        wise seeketh knowledge.

018:016 A man's gift maketh room for him, and bringeth him before
        great men.

018:017 He that is first in his own cause seemeth just; but his
        neighbour cometh and searcheth him.

018:018 The lot causeth contentions to cease, and parteth between the
        mighty.

018:019 A brother offended is harder to be won than a strong city: and
        their contentions are like the bars of a castle.

018:020 A man's belly shall be satisfied with the fruit of his mouth;
        and with the increase of his lips shall he be filled.

018:021 Death and life are in the power of the tongue: and they that
        love it shall eat the fruit thereof.

018:022 Whoso findeth a wife findeth a good thing, and obtaineth
        favour of the LORD.

018:023 The poor useth intreaties; but the rich answereth roughly.

018:024 A man that hath friends must shew himself friendly: and there
        is a friend that sticketh closer than a brother.

019:001 Better is the poor that walketh in his integrity, than he that
        is perverse in his lips, and is a fool.

019:002 Also, that the soul be without knowledge, it is not good; and
        he that hasteth with his feet sinneth.

019:003 The foolishness of man perverteth his way: and his heart
        fretteth against the LORD.

019:004 Wealth maketh many friends; but the poor is separated from his
        neighbour.

019:005 A false witness shall not be unpunished, and he that speaketh
        lies shall not escape.

019:006 Many will intreat the favour of the prince: and every man is a
        friend to him that giveth gifts.

019:007 All the brethren of the poor do hate him: how much more do his
        friends go far from him? he pursueth them with words, yet they
        are wanting to him.

019:008 He that getteth wisdom loveth his own soul: he that keepeth
        understanding shall find good.

019:009 A false witness shall not be unpunished, and he that speaketh
        lies shall perish.

019:010 Delight is not seemly for a fool; much less for a servant to
        have rule over princes.

019:011 The discretion of a man deferreth his anger; and it is his
        glory to pass over a transgression.

019:012 The king's wrath is as the roaring of a lion; but his favour
        is as dew upon the grass.

019:013 A foolish son is the calamity of his father: and the
        contentions of a wife are a continual dropping.

019:014 House and riches are the inheritance of fathers: and a prudent
        wife is from the LORD.

019:015 Slothfulness casteth into a deep sleep; and an idle soul shall
        suffer hunger.

019:016 He that keepeth the commandment keepeth his own soul; but he
        that despiseth his ways shall die.

019:017 He that hath pity upon the poor lendeth unto the LORD; and
        that which he hath given will he pay him again.

019:018 Chasten thy son while there is hope, and let not thy soul
        spare for his crying.

019:019 A man of great wrath shall suffer punishment: for if thou
        deliver him, yet thou must do it again.

019:020 Hear counsel, and receive instruction, that thou mayest be
        wise in thy latter end.

019:021 There are many devices in a man's heart; nevertheless the
        counsel of the LORD, that shall stand.

019:022 The desire of a man is his kindness: and a poor man is better
        than a liar.

019:023 The fear of the LORD tendeth to life: and he that hath it
        shall abide satisfied; he shall not be visited with evil.

019:024 A slothful man hideth his hand in his bosom, and will not so
        much as bring it to his mouth again.

019:025 Smite a scorner, and the simple will beware: and reprove one
        that hath understanding, and he will understand knowledge.

019:026 He that wasteth his father, and chaseth away his mother, is a
        son that causeth shame, and bringeth reproach.

019:027 Cease, my son, to hear the instruction that causeth to err
        from the words of knowledge.

019:028 An ungodly witness scorneth judgment: and the mouth of the
        wicked devoureth iniquity.

019:029 Judgments are prepared for scorners, and stripes for the back
        of fools.

020:001 Wine is a mocker, strong drink is raging: and whosoever is
        deceived thereby is not wise.

020:002 The fear of a king is as the roaring of a lion: whoso
        provoketh him to anger sinneth against his own soul.

020:003 It is an honour for a man to cease from strife: but every fool
        will be meddling.

020:004 The sluggard will not plow by reason of the cold; therefore
        shall he beg in harvest, and have nothing.

020:005 Counsel in the heart of man is like deep water; but a man of
        understanding will draw it out.

020:006 Most men will proclaim every one his own goodness: but a
        faithful man who can find?

020:007 The just man walketh in his integrity: his children are
        blessed after him.

020:008 A king that sitteth in the throne of judgment scattereth away
        all evil with his eyes.

020:009 Who can say, I have made my heart clean, I am pure from my
        sin?

020:010 Divers weights, and divers measures, both of them are alike
        abomination to the LORD.

020:011 Even a child is known by his doings, whether his work be pure,
        and whether it be right.

020:012 The hearing ear, and the seeing eye, the LORD hath made even
        both of them.

020:013 Love not sleep, lest thou come to poverty; open thine eyes,
        and thou shalt be satisfied with bread.

020:014 It is naught, it is naught, saith the buyer: but when he is
        gone his way, then he boasteth.

020:015 There is gold, and a multitude of rubies: but the lips of
        knowledge are a precious jewel.

020:016 Take his garment that is surety for a stranger: and take a
        pledge of him for a strange woman.

020:017 Bread of deceit is sweet to a man; but afterwards his mouth
        shall be filled with gravel.

020:018 Every purpose is established by counsel: and with good advice
        make war.

020:019 He that goeth about as a talebearer revealeth secrets:
        therefore meddle not with him that flattereth with his lips.

020:020 Whoso curseth his father or his mother, his lamp shall be put
        out in obscure darkness.

020:021 An inheritance may be gotten hastily at the beginning; but the
        end thereof shall not be blessed.

020:022 Say not thou, I will recompense evil; but wait on the LORD,
        and he shall save thee.

020:023 Divers weights are an abomination unto the LORD; and a false
        balance is not good.

020:024 Man's goings are of the LORD; how can a man then understand
        his own way?

020:025 It is a snare to the man who devoureth that which is holy, and
        after vows to make enquiry.

020:026 A wise king scattereth the wicked, and bringeth the wheel over
        them.

020:027 The spirit of man is the candle of the LORD, searching all the
        inward parts of the belly.

020:028 Mercy and truth preserve the king: and his throne is upholden
        by mercy.

020:029 The glory of young men is their strength: and the beauty of
        old men is the grey head.

020:030 The blueness of a wound cleanseth away evil: so do stripes the
        inward parts of the belly.

021:001 The king's heart is in the hand of the LORD, as the rivers of
        water: he turneth it whithersoever he will.

021:002 Every way of a man is right in his own eyes: but the LORD
        pondereth the hearts.

021:003 To do justice and judgment is more acceptable to the LORD than
        sacrifice.

021:004 An high look, and a proud heart, and the plowing of the
        wicked, is sin.

021:005 The thoughts of the diligent tend only to plenteousness; but
        of every one that is hasty only to want.

021:006 The getting of treasures by a lying tongue is a vanity tossed
        to and fro of them that seek death.

021:007 The robbery of the wicked shall destroy them; because they
        refuse to do judgment.

021:008 The way of man is froward and strange: but as for the pure,
        his work is right.

021:009 It is better to dwell in a corner of the housetop, than with a
        brawling woman in a wide house.

021:010 The soul of the wicked desireth evil: his neighbour findeth no
        favour in his eyes.

021:011 When the scorner is punished, the simple is made wise: and
        when the wise is instructed, he receiveth knowledge.

021:012 The righteous man wisely considereth the house of the wicked:
        but God overthroweth the wicked for their wickedness.

021:013 Whoso stoppeth his ears at the cry of the poor, he also shall
        cry himself, but shall not be heard.

021:014 A gift in secret pacifieth anger: and a reward in the bosom
        strong wrath.

021:015 It is joy to the just to do judgment: but destruction shall be
        to the workers of iniquity.

021:016 The man that wandereth out of the way of understanding shall
        remain in the congregation of the dead.

021:017 He that loveth pleasure shall be a poor man: he that loveth
        wine and oil shall not be rich.

021:018 The wicked shall be a ransom for the righteous, and the
        transgressor for the upright.

021:019 It is better to dwell in the wilderness, than with a
        contentious and an angry woman.

021:020 There is treasure to be desired and oil in the dwelling of the
        wise; but a foolish man spendeth it up.

021:021 He that followeth after righteousness and mercy findeth life,
        righteousness, and honour.

021:022 A wise man scaleth the city of the mighty, and casteth down
        the strength of the confidence thereof.

021:023 Whoso keepeth his mouth and his tongue keepeth his soul from
        troubles.

021:024 Proud and haughty scorner is his name, who dealeth in proud
        wrath.

021:025 The desire of the slothful killeth him; for his hands refuse
        to labour.

021:026 He coveteth greedily all the day long: but the righteous
        giveth and spareth not.

021:027 The sacrifice of the wicked is abomination: how much more,
        when he bringeth it with a wicked mind?

021:028 A false witness shall perish: but the man that heareth
        speaketh constantly.

021:029 A wicked man hardeneth his face: but as for the upright, he
        directeth his way.

021:030 There is no wisdom nor understanding nor counsel against the
        LORD.

021:031 The horse is prepared against the day of battle: but safety is
        of the LORD.

022:001 A GOOD name is rather to be chosen than great riches, and
        loving favour rather than silver and gold.

022:002 The rich and poor meet together: the LORD is the maker of them
        all.

022:003 A prudent man foreseeth the evil, and hideth himself: but the
        simple pass on, and are punished.

022:004 By humility and the fear of the LORD are riches, and honour,
        and life.

022:005 Thorns and snares are in the way of the froward: he that doth
        keep his soul shall be far from them.

022:006 Train up a child in the way he should go: and when he is old,
        he will not depart from it.

022:007 The rich ruleth over the poor, and the borrower is servant to
        the lender.

022:008 He that soweth iniquity shall reap vanity: and the rod of his
        anger shall fail.

022:009 He that hath a bountiful eye shall be blessed; for he giveth
        of his bread to the poor.

022:010 Cast out the scorner, and contention shall go out; yea, strife
        and reproach shall cease.

022:011 He that loveth pureness of heart, for the grace of his lips
        the king shall be his friend.

022:012 The eyes of the LORD preserve knowledge, and he overthroweth
        the words of the transgressor.

022:013 The slothful man saith, There is a lion without, I shall be
        slain in the streets.

022:014 The mouth of strange women is a deep pit: he that is abhorred
        of the LORD shall fall therein.

022:015 Foolishness is bound in the heart of a child; but the rod of
        correction shall drive it far from him.

022:016 He that oppresseth the poor to increase his riches, and he
        that giveth to the rich, shall surely come to want.

022:017 Bow down thine ear, and hear the words of the wise, and apply
        thine heart unto my knowledge.

022:018 For it is a pleasant thing if thou keep them within thee; they
        shall withal be fitted in thy lips.

022:019 That thy trust may be in the LORD, I have made known to thee
        this day, even to thee.

022:020 Have not I written to thee excellent things in counsels and
        knowledge,

022:021 That I might make thee know the certainty of the words of
        truth; that thou mightest answer the words of truth to them
        that send unto thee?

022:022 Rob not the poor, because he is poor: neither oppress the
        afflicted in the gate:

022:023 For the LORD will plead their cause, and spoil the soul of
        those that spoiled them.

022:024 Make no friendship with an angry man; and with a furious man
        thou shalt not go:

022:025 Lest thou learn his ways, and get a snare to thy soul.

022:026 Be not thou one of them that strike hands, or of them that are
        sureties for debts.

022:027 If thou hast nothing to pay, why should he take away thy bed
        from under thee?

022:028 Remove not the ancient landmark, which thy fathers have set.

022:029 Seest thou a man diligent in his business? he shall stand
        before kings; he shall not stand before mean men.

023:001 When thou sittest to eat with a ruler, consider diligently
        what is before thee:

023:002 And put a knife to thy throat, if thou be a man given to
        appetite.

023:003 Be not desirous of his dainties: for they are deceitful meat.

023:004 Labour not to be rich: cease from thine own wisdom.

023:005 Wilt thou set thine eyes upon that which is not? for riches
        certainly make themselves wings; they fly away as an eagle
        toward heaven.

023:006 Eat thou not the bread of him that hath an evil eye, neither
        desire thou his dainty meats:

023:007 For as he thinketh in his heart, so is he: Eat and drink,
        saith he to thee; but his heart is not with thee.

023:008 The morsel which thou hast eaten shalt thou vomit up, and lose
        thy sweet words.

023:009 Speak not in the ears of a fool: for he will despise the
        wisdom of thy words.

023:010 Remove not the old landmark; and enter not into the fields of
        the fatherless:

023:011 For their redeemer is mighty; he shall plead their cause with
        thee.

023:012 Apply thine heart unto instruction, and thine ears to the
        words of knowledge.

023:013 Withhold not correction from the child: for if thou beatest
        him with the rod, he shall not die.

023:014 Thou shalt beat him with the rod, and shalt deliver his soul
        from hell.

023:015 My son, if thine heart be wise, my heart shall rejoice, even
        mine.

023:016 Yea, my reins shall rejoice, when thy lips speak right things.

023:017 Let not thine heart envy sinners: but be thou in the fear of
        the LORD all the day long.

023:018 For surely there is an end; and thine expectation shall not be
        cut off.

023:019 Hear thou, my son, and be wise, and guide thine heart in the
        way.

023:020 Be not among winebibbers; among riotous eaters of flesh:

023:021 For the drunkard and the glutton shall come to poverty: and
        drowsiness shall clothe a man with rags.

023:022 Hearken unto thy father that begat thee, and despise not thy
        mother when she is old.

023:023 Buy the truth, and sell it not; also wisdom, and instruction,
        and understanding.

023:024 The father of the righteous shall greatly rejoice: and he that
        begetteth a wise child shall have joy of him.

023:025 Thy father and thy mother shall be glad, and she that bare
        thee shall rejoice.

023:026 My son, give me thine heart, and let thine eyes observe my
        ways.

023:027 For a whore is a deep ditch; and a strange woman is a narrow
        pit.

023:028 She also lieth in wait as for a prey, and increaseth the
        transgressors among men.

023:029 Who hath woe? who hath sorrow? who hath contentions? who hath
        babbling? who hath wounds without cause? who hath redness of
        eyes?

023:030 They that tarry long at the wine; they that go to seek mixed
        wine.

023:031 Look not thou upon the wine when it is red, when it giveth his
        colour in the cup, when it moveth itself aright.

023:032 At the last it biteth like a serpent, and stingeth like an
        adder.

023:033 Thine eyes shall behold strange women, and thine heart shall
        utter perverse things.

023:034 Yea, thou shalt be as he that lieth down in the midst of the
        sea, or as he that lieth upon the top of a mast.

023:035 They have stricken me, shalt thou say, and I was not sick;
        they have beaten me, and I felt it not: when shall I awake? I
        will seek it yet again.

024:001 Be not thou envious against evil men, neither desire to be
        with them.

024:002 For their heart studieth destruction, and their lips talk of
        mischief.

024:003 Through wisdom is an house builded; and by understanding it is
        established:

024:004 And by knowledge shall the chambers be filled with all
        precious and pleasant riches.

024:005 A wise man is strong; yea, a man of knowledge increaseth
        strength.

024:006 For by wise counsel thou shalt make thy war: and in multitude
        of counsellors there is safety.

024:007 Wisdom is too high for a fool: he openeth not his mouth in the
        gate.

024:008 He that deviseth to do evil shall be called a mischievous
        person.

024:009 The thought of foolishness is sin: and the scorner is an
        abomination to men.

024:010 If thou faint in the day of adversity, thy strength is small.

024:011 If thou forbear to deliver them that are drawn unto death, and
        those that are ready to be slain;

024:012 If thou sayest, Behold, we knew it not; doth not he that
        pondereth the heart consider it? and he that keepeth thy soul,
        doth not he know it? and shall not he render to every man
        according to his works?

024:013 My son, eat thou honey, because it is good; and the honeycomb,
        which is sweet to thy taste:

024:014 So shall the knowledge of wisdom be unto thy soul: when thou
        hast found it, then there shall be a reward, and thy
        expectation shall not be cut off.

024:015 Lay not wait, O wicked man, against the dwelling of the
        righteous; spoil not his resting place:

024:016 For a just man falleth seven times, and riseth up again: but
        the wicked shall fall into mischief.

024:017 Rejoice not when thine enemy falleth, and let not thine heart
        be glad when he stumbleth:

024:018 Lest the LORD see it, and it displease him, and he turn away
        his wrath from him.

024:019 Fret not thyself because of evil men, neither be thou envious
        at the wicked:

024:020 For there shall be no reward to the evil man; the candle of
        the wicked shall be put out.

024:021 My son, fear thou the LORD and the king: and meddle not with
        them that are given to change:

024:022 For their calamity shall rise suddenly; and who knoweth the
        ruin of them both?

024:023 These things also belong to the wise. It is not good to have
        respect of persons in judgment.

024:024 He that saith unto the wicked, Thou are righteous; him shall
        the people curse, nations shall abhor him:

024:025 But to them that rebuke him shall be delight, and a good
        blessing shall come upon them.

024:026 Every man shall kiss his lips that giveth a right answer.

024:027 Prepare thy work without, and make it fit for thyself in the
        field; and afterwards build thine house.

024:028 Be not a witness against thy neighbour without cause; and
        deceive not with thy lips.

024:029 Say not, I will do so to him as he hath done to me: I will
        render to the man according to his work.

024:030 I went by the field of the slothful, and by the vineyard of
        the man void of understanding;

024:031 And, lo, it was all grown over with thorns, and nettles had
        covered the face thereof, and the stone wall thereof was
        broken down.

024:032 Then I saw, and considered it well: I looked upon it, and
        received instruction.

024:033 Yet a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the
        hands to sleep:

024:034 So shall thy poverty come as one that travelleth; and thy want
        as an armed man.

025:001 These are also proverbs of Solomon, which the men of Hezekiah
        king of Judah copied out.

025:002 It is the glory of God to conceal a thing: but the honour of
        kings is to search out a matter.

025:003 The heaven for height, and the earth for depth, and the heart
        of kings is unsearchable.

025:004 Take away the dross from the silver, and there shall come
        forth a vessel for the finer.

025:005 Take away the wicked from before the king, and his throne
        shall be established in righteousness.

025:006 Put not forth thyself in the presence of the king, and stand
        not in the place of great men:

025:007 For better it is that it be said unto thee, Come up hither;
        than that thou shouldest be put lower in the presence of the
        prince whom thine eyes have seen.

025:008 Go not forth hastily to strive, lest thou know not what to do
        in the end thereof, when thy neighbour hath put thee to shame.

025:009 Debate thy cause with thy neighbour himself; and discover not
        a secret to another:

025:010 Lest he that heareth it put thee to shame, and thine infamy
        turn not away.

025:011 A word fitly spoken is like apples of gold in pictures of
        silver.

025:012 As an earring of gold, and an ornament of fine gold, so is a
        wise reprover upon an obedient ear.

025:013 As the cold of snow in the time of harvest, so is a faithful
        messenger to them that send him: for he refresheth the soul of
        his masters.

025:014 Whoso boasteth himself of a false gift is like clouds and wind
        without rain.

025:015 By long forbearing is a prince persuaded, and a soft tongue
        breaketh the bone.

025:016 Hast thou found honey? eat so much as is sufficient for thee,
        lest thou be filled therewith, and vomit it.

025:017 Withdraw thy foot from thy neighbour's house; lest he be weary
        of thee, and so hate thee.

025:018 A man that beareth false witness against his neighbour is a
        maul, and a sword, and a sharp arrow.

025:019 Confidence in an unfaithful man in time of trouble is like a
        broken tooth, and a foot out of joint.

025:020 As he that taketh away a garment in cold weather, and as
        vinegar upon nitre, so is he that singeth songs to an heavy
        heart.

025:021 If thine enemy be hungry, give him bread to eat; and if he be
        thirsty, give him water to drink:

025:022 For thou shalt heap coals of fire upon his head, and the LORD
        shall reward thee.

025:023 The north wind driveth away rain: so doth an angry countenance
        a backbiting tongue.

025:024 It is better to dwell in the corner of the housetop, than with
        a brawling woman and in a wide house.

025:025 As cold waters to a thirsty soul, so is good news from a far
        country.

025:026 A righteous man falling down before the wicked is as a
        troubled fountain, and a corrupt spring.

025:027 It is not good to eat much honey: so for men to search their
        own glory is not glory.

025:028 He that hath no rule over his own spirit is like a city that
        is broken down, and without walls.

026:001 As snow in summer, and as rain in harvest, so honour is not
        seemly for a fool.

026:002 As the bird by wandering, as the swallow by flying, so the
        curse causeless shall not come.

026:003 A whip for the horse, a bridle for the ass, and a rod for the
        fool's back.

026:004 Answer not a fool according to his folly, lest thou also be
        like unto him.

026:005 Answer a fool according to his folly, lest he be wise in his
        own conceit.

026:006 He that sendeth a message by the hand of a fool cutteth off
        the feet, and drinketh damage.

026:007 The legs of the lame are not equal: so is a parable in the
        mouth of fools.

026:008 As he that bindeth a stone in a sling, so is he that giveth
        honour to a fool.

026:009 As a thorn goeth up into the hand of a drunkard, so is a
        parable in the mouths of fools.

026:010 The great God that formed all things both rewardeth the fool,
        and rewardeth transgressors.

026:011 As a dog returneth to his vomit, so a fool returneth to his
        folly.

026:012 Seest thou a man wise in his own conceit? there is more hope
        of a fool than of him.

026:013 The slothful man saith, There is a lion in the way; a lion is
        in the streets.

026:014 As the door turneth upon his hinges, so doth the slothful upon
        his bed.

026:015 The slothful hideth his hand in his bosom; it grieveth him to
        bring it again to his mouth.

026:016 The sluggard is wiser in his own conceit than seven men that
        can render a reason.

026:017 He that passeth by, and meddleth with strife belonging not to
        him, is like one that taketh a dog by the ears.

026:018 As a mad man who casteth firebrands, arrows, and death,

026:019 So is the man that deceiveth his neighbour, and saith, Am not
        I in sport?

026:020 Where no wood is, there the fire goeth out: so where there is
        no talebearer, the strife ceaseth.

026:021 As coals are to burning coals, and wood to fire; so is a
        contentious man to kindle strife.

026:022 The words of a talebearer are as wounds, and they go down into
        the innermost parts of the belly.

026:023 Burning lips and a wicked heart are like a potsherd covered
        with silver dross.

026:024 He that hateth dissembleth with his lips, and layeth up deceit
        within him;

026:025 When he speaketh fair, believe him not: for there are seven
        abominations in his heart.

026:026 Whose hatred is covered by deceit, his wickedness shall be
        shewed before the whole congregation.

026:027 Whoso diggeth a pit shall fall therein: and he that rolleth a
        stone, it will return upon him.

026:028 A lying tongue hateth those that are afflicted by it; and a
        flattering mouth worketh ruin.

027:001 Boast not thyself of to morrow; for thou knowest not what a
        day may bring forth.

027:002 Let another man praise thee, and not thine own mouth; a
        stranger, and not thine own lips.

027:003 A stone is heavy, and the sand weighty; but a fool's wrath is
        heavier than them both.

027:004 Wrath is cruel, and anger is outrageous; but who is able to
        stand before envy?

027:005 Open rebuke is better than secret love.

027:006 Faithful are the wounds of a friend; but the kisses of an
        enemy are deceitful.

027:007 The full soul loatheth an honeycomb; but to the hungry soul
        every bitter thing is sweet.

027:008 As a bird that wandereth from her nest, so is a man that
        wandereth from his place.

027:009 Ointment and perfume rejoice the heart: so doth the sweetness
        of a man's friend by hearty counsel.

027:010 Thine own friend, and thy father's friend, forsake not;
        neither go into thy brother's house in the day of thy
        calamity: for better is a neighbour that is near than a
        brother far off.

027:011 My son, be wise, and make my heart glad, that I may answer him
        that reproacheth me.

027:012 A prudent man foreseeth the evil, and hideth himself; but the
        simple pass on, and are punished.

027:013 Take his garment that is surety for a stranger, and take a
        pledge of him for a strange woman.

027:014 He that blesseth his friend with a loud voice, rising early in
        the morning, it shall be counted a curse to him.

027:015 A continual dropping in a very rainy day and a contentious
        woman are alike.

027:016 Whosoever hideth her hideth the wind, and the ointment of his
        right hand, which bewrayeth itself.

027:017 Iron sharpeneth iron; so a man sharpeneth the countenance of
        his friend.

027:018 Whoso keepeth the fig tree shall eat the fruit thereof: so he
        that waiteth on his master shall be honoured.

027:019 As in water face answereth to face, so the heart of man to
        man.

027:020 Hell and destruction are never full; so the eyes of man are
        never satisfied.

027:021 As the fining pot for silver, and the furnace for gold; so is
        a man to his praise.

027:022 Though thou shouldest bray a fool in a mortar among wheat with
        a pestle, yet will not his foolishness depart from him.

027:023 Be thou diligent to know the state of thy flocks, and look
        well to thy herds.

027:024 For riches are not for ever: and doth the crown endure to
        every generation?

027:025 The hay appeareth, and the tender grass sheweth itself, and
        herbs of the mountains are gathered.

027:026 The lambs are for thy clothing, and the goats are the price of
        the field.

027:027 And thou shalt have goats' milk enough for thy food, for the
        food of thy household, and for the maintenance for thy
        maidens.

028:001 The wicked flee when no man pursueth: but the righteous are
        bold as a lion.

028:002 For the transgression of a land many are the princes thereof:
        but by a man of understanding and knowledge the state thereof
        shall be prolonged.

028:003 A poor man that oppresseth the poor is like a sweeping rain
        which leaveth no food.

028:004 They that forsake the law praise the wicked: but such as keep
        the law contend with them.

028:005 Evil men understand not judgment: but they that seek the LORD
        understand all things.

028:006 Better is the poor that walketh in his uprightness, than he
        that is perverse in his ways, though he be rich.

028:007 Whoso keepeth the law is a wise son: but he that is a
        companion of riotous men shameth his father.

028:008 He that by usury and unjust gain increaseth his substance, he
        shall gather it for him that will pity the poor.

028:009 He that turneth away his ear from hearing the law, even his
        prayer shall be abomination.

028:010 Whoso causeth the righteous to go astray in an evil way, he
        shall fall himself into his own pit: but the upright shall
        have good things in possession.

028:011 The rich man is wise in his own conceit; but the poor that
        hath understanding searcheth him out.

028:012 When righteous men do rejoice, there is great glory: but when
        the wicked rise, a man is hidden.

028:013 He that covereth his sins shall not prosper: but whoso
        confesseth and forsaketh them shall have mercy.

028:014 Happy is the man that feareth alway: but he that hardeneth his
        heart shall fall into mischief.

028:015 As a roaring lion, and a ranging bear; so is a wicked ruler
        over the poor people.

028:016 The prince that wanteth understanding is also a great
        oppressor: but he that hateth covetousness shall prolong his
        days.

028:017 A man that doeth violence to the blood of any person shall
        flee to the pit; let no man stay him.

028:018 Whoso walketh uprightly shall be saved: but he that is
        perverse in his ways shall fall at once.

028:019 He that tilleth his land shall have plenty of bread: but he
        that followeth after vain persons shall have poverty enough.

028:020 A faithful man shall abound with blessings: but he that maketh
        haste to be rich shall not be innocent.

028:021 To have respect of persons is not good: for for a piece of
        bread that man will transgress.

028:022 He that hasteth to be rich hath an evil eye, and considereth
        not that poverty shall come upon him.

028:023 He that rebuketh a man afterwards shall find more favour than
        he that flattereth with the tongue.

028:024 Whoso robbeth his father or his mother, and saith, It is no
        transgression; the same is the companion of a destroyer.

028:025 He that is of a proud heart stirreth up strife: but he that
        putteth his trust in the LORD shall be made fat.

028:026 He that trusteth in his own heart is a fool: but whoso walketh
        wisely, he shall be delivered.

028:027 He that giveth unto the poor shall not lack: but he that
        hideth his eyes shall have many a curse.

028:028 When the wicked rise, men hide themselves: but when they
        perish, the righteous increase.

029:001 He, that being often reproved hardeneth his neck, shall
        suddenly be destroyed, and that without remedy.

029:002 When the righteous are in authority, the people rejoice: but
        when the wicked beareth rule, the people mourn.

029:003 Whoso loveth wisdom rejoiceth his father: but he that keepeth
        company with harlots spendeth his substance.

029:004 The king by judgment establisheth the land: but he that
        receiveth gifts overthroweth it.

029:005 A man that flattereth his neighbour spreadeth a net for his
        feet.

029:006 In the transgression of an evil man there is a snare: but the
        righteous doth sing and rejoice.

029:007 The righteous considereth the cause of the poor: but the
        wicked regardeth not to know it.

029:008 Scornful men bring a city into a snare: but wise men turn away
        wrath.

029:009 If a wise man contendeth with a foolish man, whether he rage
        or laugh, there is no rest.

029:010 The bloodthirsty hate the upright: but the just seek his soul.

029:011 A fool uttereth all his mind: but a wise man keepeth it in
        till afterwards.

029:012 If a ruler hearken to lies, all his servants are wicked.

029:013 The poor and the deceitful man meet together: the LORD
        lighteneth both their eyes.

029:014 The king that faithfully judgeth the poor, his throne shall be
        established for ever.

029:015 The rod and reproof give wisdom: but a child left to himself
        bringeth his mother to shame.

029:016 When the wicked are multiplied, transgression increaseth: but
        the righteous shall see their fall.

029:017 Correct thy son, and he shall give thee rest; yea, he shall
        give delight unto thy soul.

029:018 Where there is no vision, the people perish: but he that
        keepeth the law, happy is he.

029:019 A servant will not be corrected by words: for though he
        understand he will not answer.

029:020 Seest thou a man that is hasty in his words? there is more
        hope of a fool than of him.

029:021 He that delicately bringeth up his servant from a child shall
        have him become his son at the length.

029:022 An angry man stirreth up strife, and a furious man aboundeth
        in transgression.

029:023 A man's pride shall bring him low: but honour shall uphold the
        humble in spirit.

029:024 Whoso is partner with a thief hateth his own soul: he heareth
        cursing, and bewrayeth it not.

029:025 The fear of man bringeth a snare: but whoso putteth his trust
        in the LORD shall be safe.

029:026 Many seek the ruler's favour; but every man's judgment cometh
        from the LORD.

029:027 An unjust man is an abomination to the just: and he that is
        upright in the way is abomination to the wicked.

030:001 The words of Agur the son of Jakeh, even the prophecy: the man
        spake unto Ithiel, even unto Ithiel and Ucal,

030:002 Surely I am more brutish than any man, and have not the
        understanding of a man.

030:003 I neither learned wisdom, nor have the knowledge of the holy.

030:004 Who hath ascended up into heaven, or descended? who hath
        gathered the wind in his fists? who hath bound the waters in a
        garment? who hath established all the ends of the earth? what
        is his name, and what is his son's name, if thou canst tell?

030:005 Every word of God is pure: he is a shield unto them that put
        their trust in him.

030:006 Add thou not unto his words, lest he reprove thee, and thou be
        found a liar.

030:007 Two things have I required of thee; deny me them not before I
        die:

030:008 Remove far from me vanity and lies: give me neither poverty
        nor riches; feed me with food convenient for me:

030:009 Lest I be full, and deny thee, and say, Who is the LORD? or
        lest I be poor, and steal, and take the name of my God in
        vain.

030:010 Accuse not a servant unto his master, lest he curse thee, and
        thou be found guilty.

030:011 There is a generation that curseth their father, and doth not
        bless their mother.

030:012 There is a generation that are pure in their own eyes, and yet
        is not washed from their filthiness.

030:013 There is a generation, O how lofty are their eyes! and their
        eyelids are lifted up.

030:014 There is a generation, whose teeth are as swords, and their
        jaw teeth as knives, to devour the poor from off the earth,
        and the needy from among men.

030:015 The horseleach hath two daughters, crying, Give, give. There
        are three things that are never satisfied, yea, four things
        say not, It is enough:

030:016 The grave; and the barren womb; the earth that is not filled
        with water; and the fire that saith not, It is enough.

030:017 The eye that mocketh at his father, and despiseth to obey his
        mother, the ravens of the valley shall pick it out, and the
        young eagles shall eat it.

030:018 There be three things which are too wonderful for me, yea,
        four which I know not:

030:019 The way of an eagle in the air; the way of a serpent upon a
        rock; the way of a ship in the midst of the sea; and the way
        of a man with a maid.

030:020 Such is the way of an adulterous woman; she eateth, and wipeth
        her mouth, and saith, I have done no wickedness.

030:021 For three things the earth is disquieted, and for four which
        it cannot bear:

030:022 For a servant when he reigneth; and a fool when he is filled
        with meat;

030:023 For an odious woman when she is married; and an handmaid that
        is heir to her mistress.

030:024 There be four things which are little upon the earth, but they
        are exceeding wise:

030:025 The ants are a people not strong, yet they prepare their meat
        in the summer;

030:026 The conies are but a feeble folk, yet make they their houses
        in the rocks;

030:027 The locusts have no king, yet go they forth all of them by
        bands;

030:028 The spider taketh hold with her hands, and is in kings'
        palaces.

030:029 There be three things which go well, yea, four are comely in
        going:

030:030 A lion which is strongest among beasts, and turneth not away
        for any;

030:031 A greyhound; an he goat also; and a king, against whom there
        is no rising up.

030:032 If thou hast done foolishly in lifting up thyself, or if thou
        hast thought evil, lay thine hand upon thy mouth.

030:033 Surely the churning of milk bringeth forth butter, and the
        wringing of the nose bringeth forth blood: so the forcing of
        wrath bringeth forth strife.

031:001 The words of king Lemuel, the prophecy that his mother taught
        him.

031:002 What, my son? and what, the son of my womb? and what, the son
        of my vows?

031:003 Give not thy strength unto women, nor thy ways to that which
        destroyeth kings.

031:004 It is not for kings, O Lemuel, it is not for kings to drink
        wine; nor for princes strong drink:

031:005 Lest they drink, and forget the law, and pervert the judgment
        of any of the afflicted.

031:006 Give strong drink unto him that is ready to perish, and wine
        unto those that be of heavy hearts.

031:007 Let him drink, and forget his poverty, and remember his misery
        no more.

031:008 Open thy mouth for the dumb in the cause of all such as are
        appointed to destruction.

031:009 Open thy mouth, judge righteously, and plead the cause of the
        poor and needy.

031:010 Who can find a virtuous woman? for her price is far above
        rubies.

031:011 The heart of her husband doth safely trust in her, so that he
        shall have no need of spoil.

031:012 She will do him good and not evil all the days of her life.

031:013 She seeketh wool, and flax, and worketh willingly with her
        hands.

031:014 She is like the merchants' ships; she bringeth her food from
        afar.

031:015 She riseth also while it is yet night, and giveth meat to her
        household, and a portion to her maidens.

031:016 She considereth a field, and buyeth it: with the fruit of her
        hands she planteth a vineyard.

031:017 She girdeth her loins with strength, and strengtheneth her
        arms.

031:018 She perceiveth that her merchandise is good: her candle goeth
        not out by night.

031:019 She layeth her hands to the spindle, and her hands hold the
        distaff.

031:020 She stretcheth out her hand to the poor; yea, she reacheth
        forth her hands to the needy.

031:021 She is not afraid of the snow for her household: for all her
        household are clothed with scarlet.

031:022 She maketh herself coverings of tapestry; her clothing is silk
        and purple.

031:023 Her husband is known in the gates, when he sitteth among the
        elders of the land.

031:024 She maketh fine linen, and selleth it; and delivereth girdles
        unto the merchant.

031:025 Strength and honour are her clothing; and she shall rejoice in
        time to come.

031:026 She openeth her mouth with wisdom; and in her tongue is the
        law of kindness.

031:027 She looketh well to the ways of her household, and eateth not
        the bread of idleness.

031:028 Her children arise up, and call her blessed; her husband also,
        and he praiseth her.

031:029 Many daughters have done virtuously, but thou excellest them
        all.

031:030 Favour is deceitful, and beauty is vain: but a woman that
        feareth the LORD, she shall be praised.

031:031 Give her of the fruit of her hands; and let her own works
        praise her in the gates.

Book 21	Ecclesiastes

001:001 The words of the Preacher, the son of David, king in
        Jerusalem.

001:002 Vanity of vanities, saith the Preacher, vanity of vanities;
        all is vanity.

001:003 What profit hath a man of all his labour which he taketh under
        the sun?

001:004 One generation passeth away, and another generation cometh:
        but the earth abideth for ever.

001:005 The sun also ariseth, and the sun goeth down, and hasteth to
        his place where he arose.

001:006 The wind goeth toward the south, and turneth about unto the
        north; it whirleth about continually, and the wind returneth
        again according to his circuits.

001:007 All the rivers run into the sea; yet the sea is not full; unto
        the place from whence the rivers come, thither they return
        again.

001:008 All things are full of labour; man cannot utter it: the eye is
        not satisfied with seeing, nor the ear filled with hearing.

001:009 The thing that hath been, it is that which shall be; and that
        which is done is that which shall be done: and there is no new
        thing under the sun.

001:010 Is there any thing whereof it may be said, See, this is new?
        it hath been already of old time, which was before us.

001:011 There is no remembrance of former things; neither shall there
        be any remembrance of things that are to come with those that
        shall come after.

001:012 I the Preacher was king over Israel in Jerusalem.

001:013 And I gave my heart to seek and search out by wisdom
        concerning all things that are done under heaven: this sore
        travail hath God given to the sons of man to be exercised
        therewith.

001:014 I have seen all the works that are done under the sun; and,
        behold, all is vanity and vexation of spirit.

001:015 That which is crooked cannot be made straight: and that which
        is wanting cannot be numbered.

001:016 I communed with mine own heart, saying, Lo, I am come to great
        estate, and have gotten more wisdom than all they that have
        been before me in Jerusalem: yea, my heart had great
        experience of wisdom and knowledge.

001:017 And I gave my heart to know wisdom, and to know madness and
        folly: I perceived that this also is vexation of spirit.

001:018 For in much wisdom is much grief: and he that increaseth
        knowledge increaseth sorrow.

002:001 I said in mine heart, Go to now, I will prove thee with mirth,
        therefore enjoy pleasure: and, behold, this also is vanity.

002:002 I said of laughter, It is mad: and of mirth, What doeth it?

002:003 I sought in mine heart to give myself unto wine, yet
        acquainting mine heart with wisdom; and to lay hold on folly,
        till I might see what was that good for the sons of men, which
        they should do under the heaven all the days of their life.

002:004 I made me great works; I builded me houses; I planted me
        vineyards:

002:005 I made me gardens and orchards, and I planted trees in them of
        all kind of fruits:

002:006 I made me pools of water, to water therewith the wood that
        bringeth forth trees:

002:007 I got me servants and maidens, and had servants born in my
        house; also I had great possessions of great and small cattle
        above all that were in Jerusalem before me:

002:008 I gathered me also silver and gold, and the peculiar treasure
        of kings and of the provinces: I gat me men singers and women
        singers, and the delights of the sons of men, as musical
        instruments, and that of all sorts.

002:009 So I was great, and increased more than all that were before
        me in Jerusalem: also my wisdom remained with me.

002:010 And whatsoever mine eyes desired I kept not from them, I
        withheld not my heart from any joy; for my heart rejoiced in
        all my labour: and this was my portion of all my labour.

002:011 Then I looked on all the works that my hands had wrought, and
        on the labour that I had laboured to do: and, behold, all was
        vanity and vexation of spirit, and there was no profit under
        the sun.

002:012 And I turned myself to behold wisdom, and madness, and folly:
        for what can the man do that cometh after the king? even that
        which hath been already done.

002:013 Then I saw that wisdom excelleth folly, as far as light
        excelleth darkness.

002:014 The wise man's eyes are in his head; but the fool walketh in
        darkness: and I myself perceived also that one event happeneth
        to them all.

002:015 Then said I in my heart, As it happeneth to the fool, so it
        happeneth even to me; and why was I then more wise? Then I
        said in my heart, that this also is vanity.

002:016 For there is no remembrance of the wise more than of the fool
        for ever; seeing that which now is in the days to come shall
        all be forgotten. And how dieth the wise man? as the fool.

002:017 Therefore I hated life; because the work that is wrought under
        the sun is grievous unto me: for all is vanity and vexation of
        spirit.

002:018 Yea, I hated all my labour which I had taken under the sun:
        because I should leave it unto the man that shall be after me.

002:019 And who knoweth whether he shall be a wise man or a fool? yet
        shall he have rule over all my labour wherein I have laboured,
        and wherein I have shewed myself wise under the sun. This is
        also vanity.

002:020 Therefore I went about to cause my heart to despair of all the
        labour which I took under the sun.

002:021 For there is a man whose labour is in wisdom, and in
        knowledge, and in equity; yet to a man that hath not laboured
        therein shall he leave it for his portion. This also is vanity
        and a great evil.

002:022 For what hath man of all his labour, and of the vexation of
        his heart, wherein he hath laboured under the sun?

002:023 For all his days are sorrows, and his travail grief; yea, his
        heart taketh not rest in the night. This is also vanity.

002:024 There is nothing better for a man, than that he should eat and
        drink, and that he should make his soul enjoy good in his
        labour. This also I saw, that it was from the hand of God.

002:025 For who can eat, or who else can hasten hereunto, more than I?

002:026 For God giveth to a man that is good in his sight wisdom, and
        knowledge, and joy: but to the sinner he giveth travail, to
        gather and to heap up, that he may give to him that is good
        before God. This also is vanity and vexation of spirit.

003:001 To every thing there is a season, and a time to every purpose
        under the heaven:

003:002 A time to be born, and a time to die; a time to plant, and a
        time to pluck up that which is planted;

003:003 A time to kill, and a time to heal; a time to break down, and
        a time to build up;

003:004 A time to weep, and a time to laugh; a time to mourn, and a
        time to dance;

003:005 A time to cast away stones, and a time to gather stones
        together; a time to embrace, and a time to refrain from
        embracing;

003:006 A time to get, and a time to lose; a time to keep, and a time
        to cast away;

003:007 A time to rend, and a time to sew; a time to keep silence, and
        a time to speak;

003:008 A time to love, and a time to hate; a time of war, and a time
        of peace.

003:009 What profit hath he that worketh in that wherein he laboureth?

003:010 I have seen the travail, which God hath given to the sons of
        men to be exercised in it.

003:011 He hath made every thing beautiful in his time: also he hath
        set the world in their heart, so that no man can find out the
        work that God maketh from the beginning to the end.

003:012 I know that there is no good in them, but for a man to
        rejoice, and to do good in his life.

003:013 And also that every man should eat and drink, and enjoy the
        good of all his labour, it is the gift of God.

003:014 I know that, whatsoever God doeth, it shall be for ever:
        nothing can be put to it, nor any thing taken from it: and God
        doeth it, that men should fear before him.

003:015 That which hath been is now; and that which is to be hath
        already been; and God requireth that which is past.

003:016 And moreover I saw under the sun the place of judgment, that
        wickedness was there; and the place of righteousness, that
        iniquity was there.

003:017 I said in mine heart, God shall judge the righteous and the
        wicked: for there is a time there for every purpose and for
        every work.

003:018 I said in mine heart concerning the estate of the sons of men,
        that God might manifest them, and that they might see that
        they themselves are beasts.

003:019 For that which befalleth the sons of men befalleth beasts;
        even one thing befalleth them: as the one dieth, so dieth the
        other; yea, they have all one breath; so that a man hath no
        preeminence above a beast: for all is vanity.

003:020 All go unto one place; all are of the dust, and all turn to
        dust again.

003:021 Who knoweth the spirit of man that goeth upward, and the
        spirit of the beast that goeth downward to the earth?

003:022 Wherefore I perceive that there is nothing better, than that a
        man should rejoice in his own works; for that is his portion:
        for who shall bring him to see what shall be after him?

004:001 So I returned, and considered all the oppressions that are
        done under the sun: and behold the tears of such as were
        oppressed, and they had no comforter; and on the side of their
        oppressors there was power; but they had no comforter.

004:002 Wherefore I praised the dead which are already dead more than
        the living which are yet alive.

004:003 Yea, better is he than both they, which hath not yet been, who
        hath not seen the evil work that is done under the sun.

004:004 Again, I considered all travail, and every right work, that
        for this a man is envied of his neighbour. This is also vanity
        and vexation of spirit.

004:005 The fool foldeth his hands together, and eateth his own flesh.

004:006 Better is an handful with quietness, than both the hands full
        with travail and vexation of spirit.

004:007 Then I returned, and I saw vanity under the sun.

004:008 There is one alone, and there is not a second; yea, he hath
        neither child nor brother: yet is there no end of all his
        labour; neither is his eye satisfied with riches; neither
        saith he, For whom do I labour, and bereave my soul of good?
        This is also vanity, yea, it is a sore travail.

004:009 Two are better than one; because they have a good reward for
        their labour.

004:010 For if they fall, the one will lift up his fellow: but woe to
        him that is alone when he falleth; for he hath not another to
        help him up.

004:011 Again, if two lie together, then they have heat: but how can
        one be warm alone?

004:012 And if one prevail against him, two shall withstand him; and a
        threefold cord is not quickly broken.

004:013 Better is a poor and a wise child than an old and foolish
        king, who will no more be admonished.

004:014 For out of prison he cometh to reign; whereas also he that is
        born in his kingdom becometh poor.

004:015 I considered all the living which walk under the sun, with the
        second child that shall stand up in his stead.

004:016 There is no end of all the people, even of all that have been
        before them: they also that come after shall not rejoice in
        him. Surely this also is vanity and vexation of spirit.

005:001 Keep thy foot when thou goest to the house of God, and be more
        ready to hear, than to give the sacrifice of fools: for they
        consider not that they do evil.

005:002 Be not rash with thy mouth, and let not thine heart be hasty
        to utter any thing before God: for God is in heaven, and thou
        upon earth: therefore let thy words be few.

005:003 For a dream cometh through the multitude of business; and a
        fool's voice is known by multitude of words.

005:004 When thou vowest a vow unto God, defer not to pay it; for he
        hath no pleasure in fools: pay that which thou hast vowed.

005:005 Better is it that thou shouldest not vow, than that thou
        shouldest vow and not pay.

005:006 Suffer not thy mouth to cause thy flesh to sin; neither say
        thou before the angel, that it was an error: wherefore should
        God be angry at thy voice, and destroy the work of thine
        hands?

005:007 For in the multitude of dreams and many words there are also
        divers vanities: but fear thou God.

005:008 If thou seest the oppression of the poor, and violent
        perverting of judgment and justice in a province, marvel not
        at the matter: for he that is higher than the highest
        regardeth; and there be higher than they.

005:009 Moreover the profit of the earth is for all: the king himself
        is served by the field.

005:010 He that loveth silver shall not be satisfied with silver; nor
        he that loveth abundance with increase: this is also vanity.

005:011 When goods increase, they are increased that eat them: and
        what good is there to the owners thereof, saving the beholding
        of them with their eyes?

005:012 The sleep of a labouring man is sweet, whether he eat little
        or much: but the abundance of the rich will not suffer him to
        sleep.

005:013 There is a sore evil which I have seen under the sun, namely,
        riches kept for the owners thereof to their hurt.

005:014 But those riches perish by evil travail: and he begetteth a
        son, and there is nothing in his hand.

005:015 As he came forth of his mother's womb, naked shall he return
        to go as he came, and shall take nothing of his labour, which
        he may carry away in his hand.

005:016 And this also is a sore evil, that in all points as he came,
        so shall he go: and what profit hath he that hath laboured for
        the wind?

005:017 All his days also he eateth in darkness, and he hath much
        sorrow and wrath with his sickness.

005:018 Behold that which I have seen: it is good and comely for one
        to eat and to drink, and to enjoy the good of all his labour
        that he taketh under the sun all the days of his life, which
        God giveth him: for it is his portion.

005:019 Every man also to whom God hath given riches and wealth, and
        hath given him power to eat thereof, and to take his portion,
        and to rejoice in his labour; this is the gift of God.

005:020 For he shall not much remember the days of his life; because
        God answereth him in the joy of his heart.

006:001 There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, and it is
        common among men:

006:002 A man to whom God hath given riches, wealth, and honour, so
        that he wanteth nothing for his soul of all that he desireth,
        yet God giveth him not power to eat thereof, but a stranger
        eateth it: this is vanity, and it is an evil disease.

006:003 If a man beget an hundred children, and live many years, so
        that the days of his years be many, and his soul be not filled
        with good, and also that he have no burial; I say, that an
        untimely birth is better than he.

006:004 For he cometh in with vanity, and departeth in darkness, and
        his name shall be covered with darkness.

006:005 Moreover he hath not seen the sun, nor known any thing: this
        hath more rest than the other.

006:006 Yea, though he live a thousand years twice told, yet hath he
        seen no good: do not all go to one place?

006:007 All the labour of man is for his mouth, and yet the appetite
        is not filled.

006:008 For what hath the wise more than the fool? what hath the poor,
        that knoweth to walk before the living?

006:009 Better is the sight of the eyes than the wandering of the
        desire: this is also vanity and vexation of spirit.

006:010 That which hath been is named already, and it is known that it
        is man: neither may he contend with him that is mightier than
        he.

006:011 Seeing there be many things that increase vanity, what is man
        the better?

006:012 For who knoweth what is good for man in this life, all the
        days of his vain life which he spendeth as a shadow? for who
        can tell a man what shall be after him under the sun?

007:001 A good name is better than precious ointment; and the day of
        death than the day of one's birth.

007:002 It is better to go to the house of mourning, than to go to the
        house of feasting: for that is the end of all men; and the
        living will lay it to his heart.

007:003 Sorrow is better than laughter: for by the sadness of the
        countenance the heart is made better.

007:004 The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning; but the
        heart of fools is in the house of mirth.

007:005 It is better to hear the rebuke of the wise, than for a man to
        hear the song of fools.

007:006 For as the crackling of thorns under a pot, so is the laughter
        of the fool: this also is vanity.

007:007 Surely oppression maketh a wise man mad; and a gift destroyeth
        the heart.

007:008 Better is the end of a thing than the beginning thereof: and
        the patient in spirit is better than the proud in spirit.

007:009 Be not hasty in thy spirit to be angry: for anger resteth in
        the bosom of fools.

007:010 Say not thou, What is the cause that the former days were
        better than these? for thou dost not enquire wisely concerning
        this.

007:011 Wisdom is good with an inheritance: and by it there is profit
        to them that see the sun.

007:012 For wisdom is a defence, and money is a defence: but the
        excellency of knowledge is, that wisdom giveth life to them
        that have it.

007:013 Consider the work of God: for who can make that straight,
        which he hath made crooked?

007:014 In the day of prosperity be joyful, but in the day of
        adversity consider: God also hath set the one over against the
        other, to the end that man should find nothing after him.

007:015 All things have I seen in the days of my vanity: there is a
        just man that perisheth in his righteousness, and there is a
        wicked man that prolongeth his life in his wickedness.

007:016 Be not righteous over much; neither make thyself over wise:
        why shouldest thou destroy thyself ?

007:017 Be not over much wicked, neither be thou foolish: why
        shouldest thou die before thy time?

007:018 It is good that thou shouldest take hold of this; yea, also
        from this withdraw not thine hand: for he that feareth God
        shall come forth of them all.

007:019 Wisdom strengtheneth the wise more than ten mighty men which
        are in the city.

007:020 For there is not a just man upon earth, that doeth good, and
        sinneth not.

007:021 Also take no heed unto all words that are spoken; lest thou
        hear thy servant curse thee:

007:022 For oftentimes also thine own heart knoweth that thou thyself
        likewise hast cursed others.

007:023 All this have I proved by wisdom: I said, I will be wise; but
        it was far from me.

007:024 That which is far off, and exceeding deep, who can find it
        out?

007:025 I applied mine heart to know, and to search, and to seek out
        wisdom, and the reason of things, and to know the wickedness
        of folly, even of foolishness and madness:

007:026 And I find more bitter than death the woman, whose heart is
        snares and nets, and her hands as bands: whoso pleaseth God
        shall escape from her; but the sinner shall be taken by her.

007:027 Behold, this have I found, saith the preacher, counting one by
        one, to find out the account:

007:028 Which yet my soul seeketh, but I find not: one man among a
        thousand have I found; but a woman among all those have I not
        found.

007:029 Lo, this only have I found, that God hath made man upright;
        but they have sought out many inventions.

008:001 Who is as the wise man? and who knoweth the interpretation of
        a thing? a man's wisdom maketh his face to shine, and the
        boldness of his face shall be changed.

008:002 I counsel thee to keep the king's commandment, and that in
        regard of the oath of God.

008:003 Be not hasty to go out of his sight: stand not in an evil
        thing; for he doeth whatsoever pleaseth him.

008:004 Where the word of a king is, there is power: and who may say
        unto him, What doest thou?

008:005 Whoso keepeth the commandment shall feel no evil thing: and a
        wise man's heart discerneth both time and judgment.

008:006 Because to every purpose there is time and judgment, therefore
        the misery of man is great upon him.

008:007 For he knoweth not that which shall be: for who can tell him
        when it shall be?

008:008 There is no man that hath power over the spirit to retain the
        spirit; neither hath he power in the day of death: and there
        is no discharge in that war; neither shall wickedness deliver
        those that are given to it.

008:009 All this have I seen, and applied my heart unto every work
        that is done under the sun: there is a time wherein one man
        ruleth over another to his own hurt.

008:010 And so I saw the wicked buried, who had come and gone from the
        place of the holy, and they were forgotten in the city where
        they had so done: this is also vanity.

008:011 Because sentence against an evil work is not executed
        speedily, therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set
        in them to do evil.

008:012 Though a sinner do evil an hundred times, and his days be
        prolonged, yet surely I know that it shall be well with them
        that fear God, which fear before him:

008:013 But it shall not be well with the wicked, neither shall he
        prolong his days, which are as a shadow; because he feareth
        not before God.

008:014 There is a vanity which is done upon the earth; that there be
        just men, unto whom it happeneth according to the work of the
        wicked; again, there be wicked men, to whom it happeneth
        according to the work of the righteous: I said that this also
        is vanity.

008:015 Then I commended mirth, because a man hath no better thing
        under the sun, than to eat, and to drink, and to be merry: for
        that shall abide with him of his labour the days of his life,
        which God giveth him under the sun.

008:016 When I applied mine heart to know wisdom, and to see the
        business that is done upon the earth: (for also there is that
        neither day nor night seeth sleep with his eyes:)

008:017 Then I beheld all the work of God, that a man cannot find out
        the work that is done under the sun: because though a man
        labour to seek it out, yet he shall not find it; yea farther;
        though a wise man think to know it, yet shall he not be able
        to find it.

009:001 For all this I considered in my heart even to declare all
        this, that the righteous, and the wise, and their works, are
        in the hand of God: no man knoweth either love or hatred by
        all that is before them.

009:002 All things come alike to all: there is one event to the
        righteous, and to the wicked; to the good and to the clean,
        and to the unclean; to him that sacrificeth, and to him that
        sacrificeth not: as is the good, so is the sinner; and he that
        sweareth, as he that feareth an oath.

009:003 This is an evil among all things that are done under the sun,
        that there is one event unto all: yea, also the heart of the
        sons of men is full of evil, and madness is in their heart
        while they live, and after that they go to the dead.

009:004 For to him that is joined to all the living there is hope: for
        a living dog is better than a dead lion.

009:005 For the living know that they shall die: but the dead know not
        any thing, neither have they any more a reward; for the memory
        of them is forgotten.

009:006 Also their love, and their hatred, and their envy, is now
        perished; neither have they any more a portion for ever in any
        thing that is done under the sun.

009:007 Go thy way, eat thy bread with joy, and drink thy wine with a
        merry heart; for God now accepteth thy works.

009:008 Let thy garments be always white; and let thy head lack no
        ointment.

009:009 Live joyfully with the wife whom thou lovest all the days of
        the life of thy vanity, which he hath given thee under the
        sun, all the days of thy vanity: for that is thy portion in
        this life, and in thy labour which thou takest under the sun.

009:010 Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might; for
        there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in
        the grave, whither thou goest.

009:011 I returned, and saw under the sun, that the race is not to the
        swift, nor the battle to the strong, neither yet bread to the
        wise, nor yet riches to men of understanding, nor yet favour
        to men of skill; but time and chance happeneth to them all.

009:012 For man also knoweth not his time: as the fishes that are
        taken in an evil net, and as the birds that are caught in the
        snare; so are the sons of men snared in an evil time, when it
        falleth suddenly upon them.

009:013 This wisdom have I seen also under the sun, and it seemed
        great unto me:

009:014 There was a little city, and few men within it; and there came
        a great king against it, and besieged it, and built great
        bulwarks against it:

009:015 Now there was found in it a poor wise man, and he by his
        wisdom delivered the city; yet no man remembered that same
        poor man.

009:016 Then said I, Wisdom is better than strength: nevertheless the
        poor man's wisdom is despised, and his words are not heard.

009:017 The words of wise men are heard in quiet more than the cry of
        him that ruleth among fools.

009:018 Wisdom is better than weapons of war: but one sinner
        destroyeth much good.

010:001 Dead flies cause the ointment of the apothecary to send forth
        a stinking savour: so doth a little folly him that is in
        reputation for wisdom and honour.

010:002 A wise man's heart is at his right hand; but a fool's heart at
        his left.

010:003 Yea also, when he that is a fool walketh by the way, his
        wisdom faileth him, and he saith to every one that he is a
        fool.

010:004 If the spirit of the ruler rise up against thee, leave not thy
        place; for yielding pacifieth great offences.

010:005 There is an evil which I have seen under the sun, as an error
        which proceedeth from the ruler:

010:006 Folly is set in great dignity, and the rich sit in low place.

010:007 I have seen servants upon horses, and princes walking as
        servants upon the earth.

010:008 He that diggeth a pit shall fall into it; and whoso breaketh
        an hedge, a serpent shall bite him.

010:009 Whoso removeth stones shall be hurt therewith; and he that
        cleaveth wood shall be endangered thereby.

010:010 If the iron be blunt, and he do not whet the edge, then must
        he put to more strength: but wisdom is profitable to direct.

010:011 Surely the serpent will bite without enchantment; and a
        babbler is no better.

010:012 The words of a wise man's mouth are gracious; but the lips of
        a fool will swallow up himself.

010:013 The beginning of the words of his mouth is foolishness: and
        the end of his talk is mischievous madness.

010:014 A fool also is full of words: a man cannot tell what shall be;
        and what shall be after him, who can tell him?

010:015 The labour of the foolish wearieth every one of them, because
        he knoweth not how to go to the city.

010:016 Woe to thee, O land, when thy king is a child, and thy princes
        eat in the morning!

010:017 Blessed art thou, O land, when thy king is the son of nobles,
        and thy princes eat in due season, for strength, and not for
        drunkenness!

010:018 By much slothfulness the building decayeth; and through
        idleness of the hands the house droppeth through.

010:019 A feast is made for laughter, and wine maketh merry: but money
        answereth all things.

010:020 Curse not the king, no not in thy thought; and curse not the
        rich in thy bedchamber: for a bird of the air shall carry the
        voice, and that which hath wings shall tell the matter.

011:001 Cast thy bread upon the waters: for thou shalt find it after
        many days.

011:002 Give a portion to seven, and also to eight; for thou knowest
        not what evil shall be upon the earth.

011:003 If the clouds be full of rain, they empty themselves upon the
        earth: and if the tree fall toward the south, or toward the
        north, in the place where the tree falleth, there it shall be.

011:004 He that observeth the wind shall not sow; and he that
        regardeth the clouds shall not reap.

011:005 As thou knowest not what is the way of the spirit, nor how the
        bones do grow in the womb of her that is with child: even so
        thou knowest not the works of God who maketh all.

011:006 In the morning sow thy seed, and in the evening withhold not
        thine hand: for thou knowest not whether shall prosper, either
        this or that, or whether they both shall be alike good.

011:007 Truly the light is sweet, and a pleasant thing it is for the
        eyes to behold the sun:

011:008 But if a man live many years, and rejoice in them all; yet let
        him remember the days of darkness; for they shall be many. All
        that cometh is vanity.

011:009 Rejoice, O young man, in thy youth; and let thy heart cheer
        thee in the days of thy youth, and walk in the ways of thine
        heart, and in the sight of thine eyes: but know thou, that for
        all these things God will bring thee into judgment.

011:010 Therefore remove sorrow from thy heart, and put away evil from
        thy flesh: for childhood and youth are vanity.

012:001 Remember now thy Creator in the days of thy youth, while the
        evil days come not, nor the years draw nigh, when thou shalt
        say, I have no pleasure in them;

012:002 While the sun, or the light, or the moon, or the stars, be not
        darkened, nor the clouds return after the rain:

012:003 In the day when the keepers of the house shall tremble, and
        the strong men shall bow themselves, and the grinders cease
        because they are few, and those that look out of the windows
        be darkened,

012:004 And the doors shall be shut in the streets, when the sound of
        the grinding is low, and he shall rise up at the voice of the
        bird, and all the daughters of musick shall be brought low;

012:005 Also when they shall be afraid of that which is high, and
        fears shall be in the way, and the almond tree shall flourish,
        and the grasshopper shall be a burden, and desire shall fail:
        because man goeth to his long home, and the mourners go about
        the streets:

012:006 Or ever the silver cord be loosed, or the golden bowl be
        broken, or the pitcher be broken at the fountain, or the wheel
        broken at the cistern.

012:007 Then shall the dust return to the earth as it was: and the
        spirit shall return unto God who gave it.

012:008 Vanity of vanities, saith the preacher; all is vanity.

012:009 And moreover, because the preacher was wise, he still taught
        the people knowledge; yea, he gave good heed, and sought out,
        and set in order many proverbs.

012:010 The preacher sought to find out acceptable words: and that
        which was written was upright, even words of truth.

012:011 The words of the wise are as goads, and as nails fastened by
        the masters of assemblies, which are given from one shepherd.

012:012 And further, by these, my son, be admonished: of making many
        books there is no end; and much study is a weariness of the
        flesh.

012:013 Let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter: Fear God, and
        keep his commandments: for this is the whole duty of man.

012:014 For God shall bring every work into judgment, with every
        secret thing, whether it be good, or whether it be evil.

Book 22	Song of Solomon

001:001 The song of songs, which is Solomon's.

001:002 Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth: for thy love is
        better than wine.

001:003 Because of the savour of thy good ointments thy name is as
        ointment poured forth, therefore do the virgins love thee.

001:004 Draw me, we will run after thee: the king hath brought me into
        his chambers: we will be glad and rejoice in thee, we will
        remember thy love more than wine: the upright love thee.

001:005 I am black, but comely, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, as the
        tents of Kedar, as the curtains of Solomon.

001:006 Look not upon me, because I am black, because the sun hath
        looked upon me: my mother's children were angry with me; they
        made me the keeper of the vineyards; but mine own vineyard
        have I not kept.

001:007 Tell me, O thou whom my soul loveth, where thou feedest, where
        thou makest thy flock to rest at noon: for why should I be as
        one that turneth aside by the flocks of thy companions?

001:008 If thou know not, O thou fairest among women, go thy way forth
        by the footsteps of the flock, and feed thy kids beside the
        shepherds' tents.

001:009 I have compared thee, O my love, to a company of horses in
        Pharaoh's chariots.

001:010 Thy cheeks are comely with rows of jewels, thy neck with
        chains of gold.

001:011 We will make thee borders of gold with studs of silver.

001:012 While the king sitteth at his table, my spikenard sendeth
        forth the smell thereof.

001:013 A bundle of myrrh is my well-beloved unto me; he shall lie all
        night betwixt my breasts.

001:014 My beloved is unto me as a cluster of camphire in the
        vineyards of Engedi.

001:015 Behold, thou art fair, my love; behold, thou art fair; thou
        hast doves' eyes.

001:016 Behold, thou art fair, my beloved, yea, pleasant: also our bed
        is green.

001:017 The beams of our house are cedar, and our rafters of fir.

002:001 I am the rose of Sharon, and the lily of the valleys.

002:002 As the lily among thorns, so is my love among the daughters.

002:003 As the apple tree among the trees of the wood, so is my
        beloved among the sons. I sat down under his shadow with great
        delight, and his fruit was sweet to my taste.

002:004 He brought me to the banqueting house, and his banner over me
        was love.

002:005 Stay me with flagons, comfort me with apples: for I am sick of
        love.

002:006 His left hand is under my head, and his right hand doth
        embrace me.

002:007 I charge you, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, by the roes, and by
        the hinds of the field, that ye stir not up, nor awake my
        love, till he please.

002:008 The voice of my beloved! behold, he cometh leaping upon the
        mountains, skipping upon the hills.

002:009 My beloved is like a roe or a young hart: behold, he standeth
        behind our wall, he looketh forth at the windows, shewing
        himself through the lattice.

002:010 My beloved spake, and said unto me, Rise up, my love, my fair
        one, and come away.

002:011 For, lo, the winter is past, the rain is over and gone;

002:012 The flowers appear on the earth; the time of the singing of
        birds is come, and the voice of the turtle is heard in our
        land;

002:013 The fig tree putteth forth her green figs, and the vines with
        the tender grape give a good smell. Arise, my love, my fair
        one, and come away.

002:014 O my dove, that art in the clefts of the rock, in the secret
        places of the stairs, let me see thy countenance, let me hear
        thy voice; for sweet is thy voice, and thy countenance is
        comely.

002:015 Take us the foxes, the little foxes, that spoil the vines: for
        our vines have tender grapes.

002:016 My beloved is mine, and I am his: he feedeth among the lilies.

002:017 Until the day break, and the shadows flee away, turn, my
        beloved, and be thou like a roe or a young hart upon the
        mountains of Bether.

003:001 By night on my bed I sought him whom my soul loveth: I sought
        him, but I found him not.

003:002 I will rise now, and go about the city in the streets, and in
        the broad ways I will seek him whom my soul loveth: I sought
        him, but I found him not.

003:003 The watchmen that go about the city found me: to whom I said,
        Saw ye him whom my soul loveth?

003:004 It was but a little that I passed from them, but I found him
        whom my soul loveth: I held him, and would not let him go,
        until I had brought him into my mother's house, and into the
        chamber of her that conceived me.

003:005 I charge you, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, by the roes, and by
        the hinds of the field, that ye stir not up, nor awake my
        love, till he please.

003:006 Who is this that cometh out of the wilderness like pillars of
        smoke, perfumed with myrrh and frankincense, with all powders
        of the merchant?

003:007 Behold his bed, which is Solomon's; threescore valiant men are
        about it, of the valiant of Israel.

003:008 They all hold swords, being expert in war: every man hath his
        sword upon his thigh because of fear in the night.

003:009 King Solomon made himself a chariot of the wood of Lebanon.

003:010 He made the pillars thereof of silver, the bottom thereof of
        gold, the covering of it of purple, the midst thereof being
        paved with love, for the daughters of Jerusalem.

003:011 Go forth, O ye daughters of Zion, and behold king Solomon with
        the crown wherewith his mother crowned him in the day of his
        espousals, and in the day of the gladness of his heart.

004:001 Behold, thou art fair, my love; behold, thou art fair; thou
        hast doves' eyes within thy locks: thy hair is as a flock of
        goats, that appear from mount Gilead.

004:002 Thy teeth are like a flock of sheep that are even shorn, which
        came up from the washing; whereof every one bear twins, and
        none is barren among them.

004:003 Thy lips are like a thread of scarlet, and thy speech is
        comely: thy temples are like a piece of a pomegranate within
        thy locks.

004:004 Thy neck is like the tower of David builded for an armoury,
        whereon there hang a thousand bucklers, all shields of mighty
        men.

004:005 Thy two breasts are like two young roes that are twins, which
        feed among the lilies.

004:006 Until the day break, and the shadows flee away, I will get me
        to the mountain of myrrh, and to the hill of frankincense.

004:007 Thou art all fair, my love; there is no spot in thee.

004:008 Come with me from Lebanon, my spouse, with me from Lebanon:
        look from the top of Amana, from the top of Shenir and Hermon,
        from the lions' dens, from the mountains of the leopards.

004:009 Thou hast ravished my heart, my sister, my spouse; thou hast
        ravished my heart with one of thine eyes, with one chain of
        thy neck.

004:010 How fair is thy love, my sister, my spouse! how much better is
        thy love than wine! and the smell of thine ointments than all
        spices!

004:011 Thy lips, O my spouse, drop as the honeycomb: honey and milk
        are under thy tongue; and the smell of thy garments is like
        the smell of Lebanon.

004:012 A garden inclosed is my sister, my spouse; a spring shut up, a
        fountain sealed.

004:013 Thy plants are an orchard of pomegranates, with pleasant
        fruits; camphire, with spikenard,

004:014 Spikenard and saffron; calamus and cinnamon, with all trees of
        frankincense; myrrh and aloes, with all the chief spices:

004:015 A fountain of gardens, a well of living waters, and streams
        from Lebanon.

004:016 Awake, O north wind; and come, thou south; blow upon my
        garden, that the spices thereof may flow out. Let my beloved
        come into his garden, and eat his pleasant fruits.

005:001 I am come into my garden, my sister, my spouse: I have
        gathered my myrrh with my spice; I have eaten my honeycomb
        with my honey; I have drunk my wine with my milk: eat, O
        friends; drink, yea, drink abundantly, O beloved.

005:002 I sleep, but my heart waketh: it is the voice of my beloved
        that knocketh, saying, Open to me, my sister, my love, my
        dove, my undefiled: for my head is filled with dew, and my
        locks with the drops of the night.

005:003 I have put off my coat; how shall I put it on? I have washed
        my feet; how shall I defile them?

005:004 My beloved put in his hand by the hole of the door, and my
        bowels were moved for him.

005:005 I rose up to open to my beloved; and my hands dropped with
        myrrh, and my fingers with sweet smelling myrrh, upon the
        handles of the lock.

005:006 I opened to my beloved; but my beloved had withdrawn himself,
        and was gone: my soul failed when he spake: I sought him, but
        I could not find him; I called him, but he gave me no answer.

005:007 The watchmen that went about the city found me, they smote me,
        they wounded me; the keepers of the walls took away my veil
        from me.

005:008 I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem, if ye find my beloved,
        that ye tell him, that I am sick of love.

005:009 What is thy beloved more than another beloved, O thou fairest
        among women? what is thy beloved more than another beloved,
        that thou dost so charge us?

005:010 My beloved is white and ruddy, the chiefest among ten
        thousand.

005:011 His head is as the most fine gold, his locks are bushy, and
        black as a raven.

005:012 His eyes are as the eyes of doves by the rivers of waters,
        washed with milk, and fitly set.

005:013 His cheeks are as a bed of spices, as sweet flowers: his lips
        like lilies, dropping sweet smelling myrrh.

005:014 His hands are as gold rings set with the beryl: his belly is
        as bright ivory overlaid with sapphires.

005:015 His legs are as pillars of marble, set upon sockets of fine
        gold: his countenance is as Lebanon, excellent as the cedars.

005:016 His mouth is most sweet: yea, he is altogether lovely. This is
        my beloved, and this is my friend, O daughters of Jerusalem.

006:001 Whither is thy beloved gone, O thou fairest among women?
        whither is thy beloved turned aside? that we may seek him with
        thee.

006:002 My beloved is gone down into his garden, to the beds of
        spices, to feed in the gardens, and to gather lilies.

006:003 I am my beloved's, and my beloved is mine: he feedeth among
        the lilies.

006:004 Thou art beautiful, O my love, as Tirzah, comely as Jerusalem,
        terrible as an army with banners.

006:005 Turn away thine eyes from me, for they have overcome me: thy
        hair is as a flock of goats that appear from Gilead.

006:006 Thy teeth are as a flock of sheep which go up from the
        washing, whereof every one beareth twins, and there is not one
        barren among them.

006:007 As a piece of a pomegranate are thy temples within thy locks.

006:008 There are threescore queens, and fourscore concubines, and
        virgins without number.

006:009 My dove, my undefiled is but one; she is the only one of her
        mother, she is the choice one of her that bare her. The
        daughters saw her, and blessed her; yea, the queens and the
        concubines, and they praised her.

006:010 Who is she that looketh forth as the morning, fair as the
        moon, clear as the sun, and terrible as an army with banners?

006:011 I went down into the garden of nuts to see the fruits of the
        valley, and to see whether the vine flourished and the
        pomegranates budded.

006:012 Or ever I was aware, my soul made me like the chariots of
        Amminadib.

006:013 Return, return, O Shulamite; return, return, that we may look
        upon thee. What will ye see in the Shulamite? As it were the
        company of two armies.

007:001 How beautiful are thy feet with shoes, O prince's daughter!
        the joints of thy thighs are like jewels, the work of the
        hands of a cunning workman.

007:002 Thy navel is like a round goblet, which wanteth not liquor:
        thy belly is like an heap of wheat set about with lilies.

007:003 Thy two breasts are like two young roes that are twins.

007:004 Thy neck is as a tower of ivory; thine eyes like the fishpools
        in Heshbon, by the gate of Bathrabbim: thy nose is as the
        tower of Lebanon which looketh toward Damascus.

007:005 Thine head upon thee is like Carmel, and the hair of thine
        head like purple; the king is held in the galleries.

007:006 How fair and how pleasant art thou, O love, for delights!

007:007 This thy stature is like to a palm tree, and thy breasts to
        clusters of grapes.

007:008 I said, I will go up to the palm tree, I will take hold of the
        boughs thereof: now also thy breasts shall be as clusters of
        the vine, and the smell of thy nose like apples;

007:009 And the roof of thy mouth like the best wine for my beloved,
        that goeth down sweetly, causing the lips of those that are
        asleep to speak.

007:010 I am my beloved's, and his desire is toward me.

007:011 Come, my beloved, let us go forth into the field; let us lodge
        in the villages.

007:012 Let us get up early to the vineyards; let us see if the vine
        flourish, whether the tender grape appear, and the
        pomegranates bud forth: there will I give thee my loves.

007:013 The mandrakes give a smell, and at our gates are all manner of
        pleasant fruits, new and old, which I have laid up for thee, O
        my beloved.

008:001 O that thou wert as my brother, that sucked the breasts of my
        mother! when I should find thee without, I would kiss thee;
        yea, I should not be despised.

008:002 I would lead thee, and bring thee into my mother's house, who
        would instruct me: I would cause thee to drink of spiced wine
        of the juice of my pomegranate.

008:003 His left hand should be under my head, and his right hand
        should embrace me.

008:004 I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem, that ye stir not up,
        nor awake my love, until he please.

008:005 Who is this that cometh up from the wilderness, leaning upon
        her beloved? I raised thee up under the apple tree: there thy
        mother brought thee forth: there she brought thee forth that
        bare thee.

008:006 Set me as a seal upon thine heart, as a seal upon thine arm:
        for love is strong as death; jealousy is cruel as the grave:
        the coals thereof are coals of fire, which hath a most
        vehement flame.

008:007 Many waters cannot quench love, neither can the floods drown
        it: if a man would give all the substance of his house for
        love, it would utterly be contemned.

008:008 We have a little sister, and she hath no breasts: what shall
        we do for our sister in the day when she shall be spoken for?

008:009 If she be a wall, we will build upon her a palace of silver:
        and if she be a door, we will inclose her with boards of
        cedar.

008:010 I am a wall, and my breasts like towers: then was I in his
        eyes as one that found favour.

008:011 Solomon had a vineyard at Baalhamon; he let out the vineyard
        unto keepers; every one for the fruit thereof was to bring a
        thousand pieces of silver.

008:012 My vineyard, which is mine, is before me: thou, O Solomon,
        must have a thousand, and those that keep the fruit thereof
        two hundred.

008:013 Thou that dwellest in the gardens, the companions hearken to
        thy voice: cause me to hear it.

008:014 Make haste, my beloved, and be thou like to a roe or to a
        young hart upon the mountains of spices.

Book 23	Isaiah

001:001 The vision of Isaiah the son of Amoz, which he saw concerning
        Judah and Jerusalem in the days of Uzziah, Jotham, Ahaz, and
        Hezekiah, kings of Judah.

001:002 Hear, O heavens, and give ear, O earth: for the LORD hath
        spoken, I have nourished and brought up children, and they
        have rebelled against me.

001:003 The ox knoweth his owner, and the ass his master's crib: but
        Israel doth not know, my people doth not consider.

001:004 Ah sinful nation, a people laden with iniquity, a seed of
        evildoers, children that are corrupters: they have forsaken
        the LORD, they have provoked the Holy One of Israel unto
        anger, they are gone away backward.

001:005 Why should ye be stricken any more? ye will revolt more and
        more: the whole head is sick, and the whole heart faint.

001:006 From the sole of the foot even unto the head there is no
        soundness in it; but wounds, and bruises, and putrifying
        sores: they have not been closed, neither bound up, neither
        mollified with ointment.

001:007 Your country is desolate, your cities are burned with fire:
        your land, strangers devour it in your presence, and it is
        desolate, as overthrown by strangers.

001:008 And the daughter of Zion is left as a cottage in a vineyard,
        as a lodge in a garden of cucumbers, as a besieged city.

001:009 Except the LORD of hosts had left unto us a very small
        remnant, we should have been as Sodom, and we should have been
        like unto Gomorrah.

001:010 Hear the word of the LORD, ye rulers of Sodom; give ear unto
        the law of our God, ye people of Gomorrah.

001:011 To what purpose is the multitude of your sacrifices unto me?
        saith the LORD: I am full of the burnt offerings of rams, and
        the fat of fed beasts; and I delight not in the blood of
        bullocks, or of lambs, or of he goats.

001:012 When ye come to appear before me, who hath required this at
        your hand, to tread my courts?

001:013 Bring no more vain oblations; incense is an abomination unto
        me; the new moons and sabbaths, the calling of assemblies, I
        cannot away with; it is iniquity, even the solemn meeting.

001:014 Your new moons and your appointed feasts my soul hateth: they
        are a trouble unto me; I am weary to bear them.

001:015 And when ye spread forth your hands, I will hide mine eyes
        from you: yea, when ye make many prayers, I will not hear:
        your hands are full of blood.

001:016 Wash you, make you clean; put away the evil of your doings
        from before mine eyes; cease to do evil;

001:017 Learn to do well; seek judgment, relieve the oppressed, judge
        the fatherless, plead for the widow.

001:018 Come now, and let us reason together, saith the LORD: though
        your sins be as scarlet, they shall be as white as snow;
        though they be red like crimson, they shall be as wool.

001:019 If ye be willing and obedient, ye shall eat the good of the
        land:

001:020 But if ye refuse and rebel, ye shall be devoured with the
        sword: for the mouth of the LORD hath spoken it.

001:021 How is the faithful city become an harlot! it was full of
        judgment; righteousness lodged in it; but now murderers.

001:022 Thy silver is become dross, thy wine mixed with water:

001:023 Thy princes are rebellious, and companions of thieves: every
        one loveth gifts, and followeth after rewards: they judge not
        the fatherless, neither doth the cause of the widow come unto
        them.

001:024 Therefore saith the LORD, the LORD of hosts, the mighty One of
        Israel, Ah, I will ease me of mine adversaries, and avenge me
        of mine enemies:

001:025 And I will turn my hand upon thee, and purely purge away thy
        dross, and take away all thy tin:

001:026 And I will restore thy judges as at the first, and thy
        counsellors as at the beginning: afterward thou shalt be
        called, The city of righteousness, the faithful city.

001:027 Zion shall be redeemed with judgment, and her converts with
        righteousness.

001:028 And the destruction of the transgressors and of the sinners
        shall be together, and they that forsake the LORD shall be
        consumed.

001:029 For they shall be ashamed of the oaks which ye have desired,
        and ye shall be confounded for the gardens that ye have
        chosen.

001:030 For ye shall be as an oak whose leaf fadeth, and as a garden
        that hath no water.

001:031 And the strong shall be as tow, and the maker of it as a
        spark, and they shall both burn together, and none shall
        quench them.

002:001 The word that Isaiah the son of Amoz saw concerning Judah and
        Jerusalem.

002:002 And it shall come to pass in the last days, that the mountain
        of the LORD's house shall be established in the top of the
        mountains, and shall be exalted above the hills; and all
        nations shall flow unto it.

002:003 And many people shall go and say, Come ye, and let us go up to
        the mountain of the LORD, to the house of the God of Jacob;
        and he will teach us of his ways, and we will walk in his
        paths: for out of Zion shall go forth the law, and the word of
        the LORD from Jerusalem.

002:004 And he shall judge among the nations, and shall rebuke many
        people: and they shall beat their swords into plowshares, and
        their spears into pruninghooks: nation shall not lift up sword
        against nation, neither shall they learn war any more.

002:005 O house of Jacob, come ye, and let us walk in the light of the
        LORD.

002:006 Therefore thou hast forsaken thy people the house of Jacob,
        because they be replenished from the east, and are soothsayers
        like the Philistines, and they please themselves in the
        children of strangers.

002:007 Their land also is full of silver and gold, neither is there
        any end of their treasures; their land is also full of horses,
        neither is there any end of their chariots:

002:008 Their land also is full of idols; they worship the work of
        their own hands, that which their own fingers have made:

002:009 And the mean man boweth down, and the great man humbleth
        himself: therefore forgive them not.

002:010 Enter into the rock, and hide thee in the dust, for fear of
        the LORD, and for the glory of his majesty.

002:011 The lofty looks of man shall be humbled, and the haughtiness
        of men shall be bowed down, and the LORD alone shall be
        exalted in that day.

002:012 For the day of the LORD of hosts shall be upon every one that
        is proud and lofty, and upon every one that is lifted up; and
        he shall be brought low:

002:013 And upon all the cedars of Lebanon, that are high and lifted
        up, and upon all the oaks of Bashan,

002:014 And upon all the high mountains, and upon all the hills that
        are lifted up,

002:015 And upon every high tower, and upon every fenced wall,

002:016 And upon all the ships of Tarshish, and upon all pleasant
        pictures.

002:017 And the loftiness of man shall be bowed down, and the
        haughtiness of men shall be made low: and the LORD alone shall
        be exalted in that day.

002:018 And the idols he shall utterly abolish.

002:019 And they shall go into the holes of the rocks, and into the
        caves of the earth, for fear of the LORD, and for the glory of
        his majesty, when he ariseth to shake terribly the earth.

002:020 In that day a man shall cast his idols of silver, and his
        idols of gold, which they made each one for himself to
        worship, to the moles and to the bats;

002:021 To go into the clefts of the rocks, and into the tops of the
        ragged rocks, for fear of the LORD, and for the glory of his
        majesty, when he ariseth to shake terribly the earth.

002:022 Cease ye from man, whose breath is in his nostrils: for
        wherein is he to be accounted of ?

003:001 For, behold, the Lord, the LORD of hosts, doth take away from
        Jerusalem and from Judah the stay and the staff, the whole
        stay of bread, and the whole stay of water.

003:002 The mighty man, and the man of war, the judge, and the
        prophet, and the prudent, and the ancient,

003:003 The captain of fifty, and the honourable man, and the
        counsellor, and the cunning artificer, and the eloquent
        orator.

003:004 And I will give children to be their princes, and babes shall
        rule over them.

003:005 And the people shall be oppressed, every one by another, and
        every one by his neighbour: the child shall behave himself
        proudly against the ancient, and the base against the
        honourable.

003:006 When a man shall take hold of his brother of the house of his
        father, saying, Thou hast clothing, be thou our ruler, and let
        this ruin be under thy hand:

003:007 In that day shall he swear, saying, I will not be an healer;
        for in my house is neither bread nor clothing: make me not a
        ruler of the people.

003:008 For Jerusalem is ruined, and Judah is fallen: because their
        tongue and their doings are against the LORD, to provoke the
        eyes of his glory.

003:009 The shew of their countenance doth witness against them; and
        they declare their sin as Sodom, they hide it not. Woe unto
        their soul! for they have rewarded evil unto themselves.

003:010 Say ye to the righteous, that it shall be well with him: for
        they shall eat the fruit of their doings.

003:011 Woe unto the wicked! it shall be ill with him: for the reward
        of his hands shall be given him.

003:012 As for my people, children are their oppressors, and women
        rule over them. O my people, they which lead thee cause thee
        to err, and destroy the way of thy paths.

003:013 The LORD standeth up to plead, and standeth to judge the
        people.

003:014 The LORD will enter into judgment with the ancients of his
        people, and the princes thereof: for ye have eaten up the
        vineyard; the spoil of the poor is in your houses.

003:015 What mean ye that ye beat my people to pieces, and grind the
        faces of the poor? saith the Lord GOD of hosts.

003:016 Moreover the LORD saith, Because the daughters of Zion are
        haughty, and walk with stretched forth necks and wanton eyes,
        walking and mincing as they go, and making a tinkling with
        their feet:

003:017 Therefore the LORD will smite with a scab the crown of the
        head of the daughters of Zion, and the LORD will discover
        their secret parts.

003:018 In that day the Lord will take away the bravery of their
        tinkling ornaments about their feet, and their cauls, and
        their round tires like the moon,

003:019 The chains, and the bracelets, and the mufflers,

003:020 The bonnets, and the ornaments of the legs, and the headbands,
        and the tablets, and the earrings,

003:021 The rings, and nose jewels,

003:022 The changeable suits of apparel, and the mantles, and the
        wimples, and the crisping pins,

003:023 The glasses, and the fine linen, and the hoods, and the vails.

003:024 And it shall come to pass, that instead of sweet smell there
        shall be stink; and instead of a girdle a rent; and instead of
        well set hair baldness; and instead of a stomacher a girding
        of sackcloth; and burning instead of beauty.

003:025 Thy men shall fall by the sword, and thy mighty in the war.

003:026 And her gates shall lament and mourn; and she being desolate
        shall sit upon the ground.

004:001 And in that day seven women shall take hold of one man,
        saying, We will eat our own bread, and wear our own apparel:
        only let us be called by thy name, to take away our reproach.

004:002 In that day shall the branch of the LORD be beautiful and
        glorious, and the fruit of the earth shall be excellent and
        comely for them that are escaped of Israel.

004:003 And it shall come to pass, that he that is left in Zion, and
        he that remaineth in Jerusalem, shall be called holy, even
        every one that is written among the living in Jerusalem:

004:004 When the Lord shall have washed away the filth of the
        daughters of Zion, and shall have purged the blood of
        Jerusalem from the midst thereof by the spirit of judgment,
        and by the spirit of burning.

004:005 And the LORD will create upon every dwelling place of mount
        Zion, and upon her assemblies, a cloud and smoke by day, and
        the shining of a flaming fire by night: for upon all the glory
        shall be a defence.

004:006 And there shall be a tabernacle for a shadow in the day time
        from the heat, and for a place of refuge, and for a covert
        from storm and from rain.

005:001 Now will I sing to my wellbeloved a song of my beloved
        touching his vineyard. My wellbeloved hath a vineyard in a
        very fruitful hill:

005:002 And he fenced it, and gathered out the stones thereof, and
        planted it with the choicest vine, and built a tower in the
        midst of it, and also made a winepress therein: and he looked
        that it should bring forth grapes, and it brought forth wild
        grapes.

005:003 And now, O inhabitants of Jerusalem, and men of Judah, judge,
        I pray you, betwixt me and my vineyard.

005:004 What could have been done more to my vineyard, that I have not
        done in it? wherefore, when I looked that it should bring
        forth grapes, brought it forth wild grapes?

005:005 And now go to; I will tell you what I will do to my vineyard:
        I will take away the hedge thereof, and it shall be eaten up;
        and break down the wall thereof, and it shall be trodden down:

005:006 And I will lay it waste: it shall not be pruned, nor digged;
        but there shall come up briers and thorns: I will also command
        the clouds that they rain no rain upon it.

005:007 For the vineyard of the LORD of hosts is the house of Israel,
        and the men of Judah his pleasant plant: and he looked for
        judgment, but behold oppression; for righteousness, but behold
        a cry.

005:008 Woe unto them that join house to house, that lay field to
        field, till there be no place, that they may be placed alone
        in the midst of the earth!

005:009 In mine ears said the LORD of hosts, Of a truth many houses
        shall be desolate, even great and fair, without inhabitant.

005:010 Yea, ten acres of vineyard shall yield one bath, and the seed
        of an homer shall yield an ephah.

005:011 Woe unto them that rise up early in the morning, that they may
        follow strong drink; that continue until night, till wine
        inflame them!

005:012 And the harp, and the viol, the tabret, and pipe, and wine,
        are in their feasts: but they regard not the work of the LORD,
        neither consider the operation of his hands.

005:013 Therefore my people are gone into captivity, because they have
        no knowledge: and their honourable men are famished, and their
        multitude dried up with thirst.

005:014 Therefore hell hath enlarged herself, and opened her mouth
        without measure: and their glory, and their multitude, and
        their pomp, and he that rejoiceth, shall descend into it.

005:015 And the mean man shall be brought down, and the mighty man
        shall be humbled, and the eyes of the lofty shall be humbled:

005:016 But the LORD of hosts shall be exalted in judgment, and God
        that is holy shall be sanctified in righteousness.

005:017 Then shall the lambs feed after their manner, and the waste
        places of the fat ones shall strangers eat.

005:018 Woe unto them that draw iniquity with cords of vanity, and sin
        as it were with a cart rope:

005:019 That say, Let him make speed, and hasten his work, that we may
        see it: and let the counsel of the Holy One of Israel draw
        nigh and come, that we may know it!

005:020 Woe unto them that call evil good, and good evil; that put
        darkness for light, and light for darkness; that put bitter
        for sweet, and sweet for bitter!

005:021 Woe unto them that are wise in their own eyes, and prudent in
        their own sight!

005:022 Woe unto them that are mighty to drink wine, and men of
        strength to mingle strong drink:

005:023 Which justify the wicked for reward, and take away the
        righteousness of the righteous from him!

005:024 Therefore as the fire devoureth the stubble, and the flame
        consumeth the chaff, so their root shall be as rottenness, and
        their blossom shall go up as dust: because they have cast away
        the law of the LORD of hosts, and despised the word of the
        Holy One of Israel.

005:025 Therefore is the anger of the LORD kindled against his people,
        and he hath stretched forth his hand against them, and hath
        smitten them: and the hills did tremble, and their carcases
        were torn in the midst of the streets. For all this his anger
        is not turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.

005:026 And he will lift up an ensign to the nations from far, and
        will hiss unto them from the end of the earth: and, behold,
        they shall come with speed swiftly:

005:027 None shall be weary nor stumble among them; none shall slumber
        nor sleep; neither shall the girdle of their loins be loosed,
        nor the latchet of their shoes be broken:

005:028 Whose arrows are sharp, and all their bows bent, their horses'
        hoofs shall be counted like flint, and their wheels like a
        whirlwind:

005:029 Their roaring shall be like a lion, they shall roar like young
        lions: yea, they shall roar, and lay hold of the prey, and
        shall carry it away safe, and none shall deliver it.

005:030 And in that day they shall roar against them like the roaring
        of the sea: and if one look unto the land, behold darkness and
        sorrow, and the light is darkened in the heavens thereof.

006:001 In the year that king Uzziah died I saw also the LORD sitting
        upon a throne, high and lifted up, and his train filled the
        temple.

006:002 Above it stood the seraphims: each one had six wings; with
        twain he covered his face, and with twain he covered his feet,
        and with twain he did fly.

006:003 And one cried unto another, and said, Holy, holy, holy, is the
        LORD of hosts: the whole earth is full of his glory.

006:004 And the posts of the door moved at the voice of him that
        cried, and the house was filled with smoke.

006:005 Then said I, Woe is me! for I am undone; because I am a man of
        unclean lips, and I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean
        lips: for mine eyes have seen the King, the LORD of hosts.

006:006 Then flew one of the seraphims unto me, having a live coal in
        his hand, which he had taken with the tongs from off the
        altar:

006:007 And he laid it upon my mouth, and said, Lo, this hath touched
        thy lips; and thine iniquity is taken away, and thy sin
        purged.

006:008 Also I heard the voice of the Lord, saying, Whom shall I send,
        and who will go for us? Then said I, Here am I; send me.

006:009 And he said, Go, and tell this people, Hear ye indeed, but
        understand not; and see ye indeed, but perceive not.

006:010 Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy,
        and shut their eyes; lest they see with their eyes, and hear
        with their ears, and understand with their heart, and convert,
        and be healed.

006:011 Then said I, Lord, how long? And he answered, Until the cities
        be wasted without inhabitant, and the houses without man, and
        the land be utterly desolate,

006:012 And the LORD have removed men far away, and there be a great
        forsaking in the midst of the land.

006:013 But yet in it shall be a tenth, and it shall return, and shall
        be eaten: as a teil tree, and as an oak, whose substance is in
        them, when they cast their leaves: so the holy seed shall be
        the substance thereof.

007:001 And it came to pass in the days of Ahaz the son of Jotham, the
        son of Uzziah, king of Judah, that Rezin the king of Syria,
        and Pekah the son of Remaliah, king of Israel, went up toward
        Jerusalem to war against it, but could not prevail against it.

007:002 And it was told the house of David, saying, Syria is
        confederate with Ephraim. And his heart was moved, and the
        heart of his people, as the trees of the wood are moved with
        the wind.

007:003 Then said the LORD unto Isaiah, Go forth now to meet Ahaz,
        thou, and Shearjashub thy son, at the end of the conduit of
        the upper pool in the highway of the fuller's field;

007:004 And say unto him, Take heed, and be quiet; fear not, neither
        be fainthearted for the two tails of these smoking firebrands,
        for the fierce anger of Rezin with Syria, and of the son of
        Remaliah.

007:005 Because Syria, Ephraim, and the son of Remaliah, have taken
        evil counsel against thee, saying,

007:006 Let us go up against Judah, and vex it, and let us make a
        breach therein for us, and set a king in the midst of it, even
        the son of Tabeal:

007:007 Thus saith the Lord GOD, It shall not stand, neither shall it
        come to pass.

007:008 For the head of Syria is Damascus, and the head of Damascus is
        Rezin; and within threescore and five years shall Ephraim be
        broken, that it be not a people.

007:009 And the head of Ephraim is Samaria, and the head of Samaria is
        Remaliah's son. If ye will not believe, surely ye shall not be
        established.

007:010 Moreover the LORD spake again unto Ahaz, saying,

007:011 Ask thee a sign of the LORD thy God; ask it either in the
        depth, or in the height above.

007:012 But Ahaz said, I will not ask, neither will I tempt the LORD.

007:013 And he said, Hear ye now, O house of David; Is it a small
        thing for you to weary men, but will ye weary my God also?

007:014 Therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign; Behold, a
        virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name
        Immanuel.

007:015 Butter and honey shall he eat, that he may know to refuse the
        evil, and choose the good.

007:016 For before the child shall know to refuse the evil, and choose
        the good, the land that thou abhorrest shall be forsaken of
        both her kings.

007:017 The LORD shall bring upon thee, and upon thy people, and upon
        thy father's house, days that have not come, from the day that
        Ephraim departed from Judah; even the king of Assyria.

007:018 And it shall come to pass in that day, that the LORD shall
        hiss for the fly that is in the uttermost part of the rivers
        of Egypt, and for the bee that is in the land of Assyria.

007:019 And they shall come, and shall rest all of them in the
        desolate valleys, and in the holes of the rocks, and upon all
        thorns, and upon all bushes.

007:020 In the same day shall the Lord shave with a razor that is
        hired, namely, by them beyond the river, by the king of
        Assyria, the head, and the hair of the feet: and it shall also
        consume the beard.

007:021 And it shall come to pass in that day, that a man shall
        nourish a young cow, and two sheep;

007:022 And it shall come to pass, for the abundance of milk that they
        shall give he shall eat butter: for butter and honey shall
        every one eat that is left in the land.

007:023 And it shall come to pass in that day, that every place shall
        be, where there were a thousand vines at a thousand
        silverlings, it shall even be for briers and thorns.

007:024 With arrows and with bows shall men come thither; because all
        the land shall become briers and thorns.

007:025 And on all hills that shall be digged with the mattock, there
        shall not come thither the fear of briers and thorns: but it
        shall be for the sending forth of oxen, and for the treading
        of lesser cattle.

008:001 Moreover the LORD said unto me, Take thee a great roll, and
        write in it with a man's pen concerning Mahershalalhashbaz.

008:002 And I took unto me faithful witnesses to record, Uriah the
        priest, and Zechariah the son of Jeberechiah.

008:003 And I went unto the prophetess; and she conceived, and bare a
        son. Then said the LORD to me, Call his name
        Mahershalalhashbaz.

008:004 For before the child shall have knowledge to cry, My father,
        and my mother, the riches of Damascus and the spoil of Samaria
        shall be taken away before the king of Assyria.

008:005 The LORD spake also unto me again, saying,

008:006 Forasmuch as this people refuseth the waters of Shiloah that
        go softly, and rejoice in Rezin and Remaliah's son;

008:007 Now therefore, behold, the Lord bringeth up upon them the
        waters of the river, strong and many, even the king of
        Assyria, and all his glory: and he shall come up over all his
        channels, and go over all his banks:

008:008 And he shall pass through Judah; he shall overflow and go
        over, he shall reach even to the neck; and the stretching out
        of his wings shall fill the breadth of thy land, O Immanuel.

008:009 Associate yourselves, O ye people, and ye shall be broken in
        pieces; and give ear, all ye of far countries: gird
        yourselves, and ye shall be broken in pieces; gird yourselves,
        and ye shall be broken in pieces.

008:010 Take counsel together, and it shall come to nought; speak the
        word, and it shall not stand: for God is with us.

008:011 For the LORD spake thus to me with a strong hand, and
        instructed me that I should not walk in the way of this
        people, saying,

008:012 Say ye not, A confederacy, to all them to whom this people
        shall say, A confederacy; neither fear ye their fear, nor be
        afraid.

008:013 Sanctify the LORD of hosts himself; and let him be your fear,
        and let him be your dread.

008:014 And he shall be for a sanctuary; but for a stone of stumbling
        and for a rock of offence to both the houses of Israel, for a
        gin and for a snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem.

008:015 And many among them shall stumble, and fall, and be broken,
        and be snared, and be taken.

008:016 Bind up the testimony, seal the law among my disciples.

008:017 And I will wait upon the LORD, that hideth his face from the
        house of Jacob, and I will look for him.

008:018 Behold, I and the children whom the LORD hath given me are for
        signs and for wonders in Israel from the LORD of hosts, which
        dwelleth in mount Zion.

008:019 And when they shall say unto you, Seek unto them that have
        familiar spirits, and unto wizards that peep, and that mutter:
        should not a people seek unto their God? for the living to the
        dead?

008:020 To the law and to the testimony: if they speak not according
        to this word, it is because there is no light in them.

008:021 And they shall pass through it, hardly bestead and hungry: and
        it shall come to pass, that when they shall be hungry, they
        shall fret themselves, and curse their king and their God, and
        look upward.

008:022 And they shall look unto the earth; and behold trouble and
        darkness, dimness of anguish; and they shall be driven to
        darkness.

009:001 Nevertheless the dimness shall not be such as was in her
        vexation, when at the first he lightly afflicted the land of
        Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, and afterward did more
        grievously afflict her by the way of the sea, beyond Jordan,
        in Galilee of the nations.

009:002 The people that walked in darkness have seen a great light:
        they that dwell in the land of the shadow of death, upon them
        hath the light shined.

009:003 Thou hast multiplied the nation, and not increased the joy:
        they joy before thee according to the joy in harvest, and as
        men rejoice when they divide the spoil.

009:004 For thou hast broken the yoke of his burden, and the staff of
        his shoulder, the rod of his oppressor, as in the day of
        Midian.

009:005 For every battle of the warrior is with confused noise, and
        garments rolled in blood; but this shall be with burning and
        fuel of fire.

009:006 For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the
        government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be
        called Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting
        Father, The Prince of Peace.

009:007 Of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no
        end, upon the throne of David, and upon his kingdom, to order
        it, and to establish it with judgment and with justice from
        henceforth even for ever. The zeal of the LORD of hosts will
        perform this.

009:008 The Lord sent a word into Jacob, and it hath lighted upon
        Israel.

009:009 And all the people shall know, even Ephraim and the inhabitant
        of Samaria, that say in the pride and stoutness of heart,

009:010 The bricks are fallen down, but we will build with hewn
        stones: the sycomores are cut down, but we will change them
        into cedars.

009:011 Therefore the LORD shall set up the adversaries of Rezin
        against him, and join his enemies together;

009:012 The Syrians before, and the Philistines behind; and they shall
        devour Israel with open mouth. For all this his anger is not
        turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.

009:013 For the people turneth not unto him that smiteth them, neither
        do they seek the LORD of hosts.

009:014 Therefore the LORD will cut off from Israel head and tail,
        branch and rush, in one day.

009:015 The ancient and honourable, he is the head; and the prophet
        that teacheth lies, he is the tail.

009:016 For the leaders of this people cause them to err; and they
        that are led of them are destroyed.

009:017 Therefore the LORD shall have no joy in their young men,
        neither shall have mercy on their fatherless and widows: for
        every one is an hypocrite and an evildoer, and every mouth
        speaketh folly. For all this his anger is not turned away, but
        his hand is stretched out still.

009:018 For wickedness burneth as the fire: it shall devour the briers
        and thorns, and shall kindle in the thickets of the forest,
        and they shall mount up like the lifting up of smoke.

009:019 Through the wrath of the LORD of hosts is the land darkened,
        and the people shall be as the fuel of the fire: no man shall
        spare his brother.

009:020 And he shall snatch on the right hand, and be hungry; and he
        shall eat on the left hand, and they shall not be satisfied:
        they shall eat every man the flesh of his own arm:

009:021 Manasseh, Ephraim; and Ephraim, Manasseh: and they together
        shall be against Judah. For all this his anger is not turned
        away, but his hand is stretched out still.

010:001 Woe unto them that decree unrighteous decrees, and that write
        grievousness which they have prescribed;

010:002 To turn aside the needy from judgment, and to take away the
        right from the poor of my people, that widows may be their
        prey, and that they may rob the fatherless!

010:003 And what will ye do in the day of visitation, and in the
        desolation which shall come from far? to whom will ye flee for
        help? and where will ye leave your glory?

010:004 Without me they shall bow down under the prisoners, and they
        shall fall under the slain. For all this his anger is not
        turned away, but his hand is stretched out still.

010:005 O Assyrian, the rod of mine anger, and the staff in their hand
        is mine indignation.

010:006 I will send him against an hypocritical nation, and against
        the people of my wrath will I give him a charge, to take the
        spoil, and to take the prey, and to tread them down like the
        mire of the streets.

010:007 Howbeit he meaneth not so, neither doth his heart think so;
        but it is in his heart to destroy and cut off nations not a
        few.

010:008 For he saith, Are not my princes altogether kings?

010:009 Is not Calno as Carchemish? is not Hamath as Arpad? is not
        Samaria as Damascus?

010:010 As my hand hath found the kingdoms of the idols, and whose
        graven images did excel them of Jerusalem and of Samaria;

010:011 Shall I not, as I have done unto Samaria and her idols, so do
        to Jerusalem and her idols?

010:012 Wherefore it shall come to pass, that when the Lord hath
        performed his whole work upon mount Zion and on Jerusalem, I
        will punish the fruit of the stout heart of the king of
        Assyria, and the glory of his high looks.

010:013 For he saith, By the strength of my hand I have done it, and
        by my wisdom; for I am prudent: and I have removed the bounds
        of the people, and have robbed their treasures, and I have put
        down the inhabitants like a valiant man:

010:014 And my hand hath found as a nest the riches of the people: and
        as one gathereth eggs that are left, have I gathered all the
        earth; and there was none that moved the wing, or opened the
        mouth, or peeped.

010:015 Shall the axe boast itself against him that heweth therewith?
        or shall the saw magnify itself against him that shaketh it?
        as if the rod should shake itself against them that lift it
        up, or as if the staff should lift up itself, as if it were no
        wood.

010:016 Therefore shall the Lord, the Lord of hosts, send among his
        fat ones leanness; and under his glory he shall kindle a
        burning like the burning of a fire.

010:017 And the light of Israel shall be for a fire, and his Holy One
        for a flame: and it shall burn and devour his thorns and his
        briers in one day;

010:018 And shall consume the glory of his forest, and of his fruitful
        field, both soul and body: and they shall be as when a
        standard-bearer fainteth.

010:019 And the rest of the trees of his forest shall be few, that a
        child may write them.

010:020 And it shall come to pass in that day, that the remnant of
        Israel, and such as are escaped of the house of Jacob, shall
        no more again stay upon him that smote them; but shall stay
        upon the LORD, the Holy One of Israel, in truth.

010:021 The remnant shall return, even the remnant of Jacob, unto the
        mighty God.

010:022 For though thy people Israel be as the sand of the sea, yet a
        remnant of them shall return: the consumption decreed shall
        overflow with righteousness.

010:023 For the Lord GOD of hosts shall make a consumption, even
        determined, in the midst of all the land.

010:024 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD of hosts, O my people that
        dwellest in Zion, be not afraid of the Assyrian: he shall
        smite thee with a rod, and shall lift up his staff against
        thee, after the manner of Egypt.

010:025 For yet a very little while, and the indignation shall cease,
        and mine anger in their destruction.

010:026 And the LORD of hosts shall stir up a scourge for him
        according to the slaughter of Midian at the rock of Oreb: and
        as his rod was upon the sea, so shall he lift it up after the
        manner of Egypt.

010:027 And it shall come to pass in that day, that his burden shall
        be taken away from off thy shoulder, and his yoke from off thy
        neck, and the yoke shall be destroyed because of the
        anointing.

010:028 He is come to Aiath, he is passed to Migron; at Michmash he
        hath laid up his carriages:

010:029 They are gone over the passage: they have taken up their
        lodging at Geba; Ramah is afraid; Gibeah of Saul is fled.

010:030 Lift up thy voice, O daughter of Gallim: cause it to be heard
        unto Laish, O poor Anathoth.

010:031 Madmenah is removed; the inhabitants of Gebim gather
        themselves to flee.

010:032 As yet shall he remain at Nob that day: he shall shake his
        hand against the mount of the daughter of Zion, the hill of
        Jerusalem.

010:033 Behold, the Lord, the LORD of hosts, shall lop the bough with
        terror: and the high ones of stature shall be hewn down, and
        the haughty shall be humbled.

010:034 And he shall cut down the thickets of the forest with iron,
        and Lebanon shall fall by a mighty one.

011:001 And there shall come forth a rod out of the stem of Jesse, and
        a Branch shall grow out of his roots:

011:002 And the spirit of the LORD shall rest upon him, the spirit of
        wisdom and understanding, the spirit of counsel and might, the
        spirit of knowledge and of the fear of the LORD;

011:003 And shall make him of quick understanding in the fear of the
        LORD: and he shall not judge after the sight of his eyes,
        neither reprove after the hearing of his ears:

011:004 But with righteousness shall he judge the poor, and reprove
        with equity for the meek of the earth: and he shall smite the
        earth: with the rod of his mouth, and with the breath of his
        lips shall he slay the wicked.

011:005 And righteousness shall be the girdle of his loins, and
        faithfulness the girdle of his reins.

011:006 The wolf also shall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard shall
        lie down with the kid; and the calf and the young lion and the
        fatling together; and a little child shall lead them.

011:007 And the cow and the bear shall feed; their young ones shall
        lie down together: and the lion shall eat straw like the ox.

011:008 And the sucking child shall play on the hole of the asp, and
        the weaned child shall put his hand on the cockatrice' den.

011:009 They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain: for
        the earth shall be full of the knowledge of the LORD, as the
        waters cover the sea.

011:010 And in that day there shall be a root of Jesse, which shall
        stand for an ensign of the people; to it shall the Gentiles
        seek: and his rest shall be glorious.

011:011 And it shall come to pass in that day, that the Lord shall set
        his hand again the second time to recover the remnant of his
        people, which shall be left, from Assyria, and from Egypt, and
        from Pathros, and from Cush, and from Elam, and from Shinar,
        and from Hamath, and from the islands of the sea.

011:012 And he shall set up an ensign for the nations, and shall
        assemble the outcasts of Israel, and gather together the
        dispersed of Judah from the four corners of the earth.

011:013 The envy also of Ephraim shall depart, and the adversaries of
        Judah shall be cut off: Ephraim shall not envy Judah, and
        Judah shall not vex Ephraim.

011:014 But they shall fly upon the shoulders of the Philistines
        toward the west; they shall spoil them of the east together:
        they shall lay their hand upon Edom and Moab; and the children
        of Ammon shall obey them.

011:015 And the LORD shall utterly destroy the tongue of the Egyptian
        sea; and with his mighty wind shall he shake his hand over the
        river, and shall smite it in the seven streams, and make men
        go over dryshod.

011:016 And there shall be an highway for the remnant of his people,
        which shall be left, from Assyria; like as it was to Israel in
        the day that he came up out of the land of Egypt.

012:001 And in that day thou shalt say, O LORD, I will praise thee:
        though thou wast angry with me, thine anger is turned away,
        and thou comfortedst me.

012:002 Behold, God is my salvation; I will trust, and not be afraid:
        for the LORD JEHOVAH is my strength and my song; he also is
        become my salvation.

012:003 Therefore with joy shall ye draw water out of the wells of
        salvation.

012:004 And in that day shall ye say, Praise the LORD, call upon his
        name, declare his doings among the people, make mention that
        his name is exalted.

012:005 Sing unto the LORD; for he hath done excellent things: this is
        known in all the earth.

012:006 Cry out and shout, thou inhabitant of Zion: for great is the
        Holy One of Israel in the midst of thee.

013:001 The burden of Babylon, which Isaiah the son of Amoz did see.

013:002 Lift ye up a banner upon the high mountain, exalt the voice
        unto them, shake the hand, that they may go into the gates of
        the nobles.

013:003 I have commanded my sanctified ones, I have also called my
        mighty ones for mine anger, even them that rejoice in my
        highness.

013:004 The noise of a multitude in the mountains, like as of a great
        people; a tumultuous noise of the kingdoms of nations gathered
        together: the LORD of hosts mustereth the host of the battle.

013:005 They come from a far country, from the end of heaven, even the
        LORD, and the weapons of his indignation, to destroy the whole
        land.

013:006 Howl ye; for the day of the LORD is at hand; it shall come as
        a destruction from the Almighty.

013:007 Therefore shall all hands be faint, and every man's heart
        shall melt:

013:008 And they shall be afraid: pangs and sorrows shall take hold of
        them; they shall be in pain as a woman that travaileth: they
        shall be amazed one at another; their faces shall be as
        flames.

013:009 Behold, the day of the LORD cometh, cruel both with wrath and
        fierce anger, to lay the land desolate: and he shall destroy
        the sinners thereof out of it.

013:010 For the stars of heaven and the constellations thereof shall
        not give their light: the sun shall be darkened in his going
        forth, and the moon shall not cause her light to shine.

013:011 And I will punish the world for their evil, and the wicked for
        their iniquity; and I will cause the arrogancy of the proud to
        cease, and will lay low the haughtiness of the terrible.

013:012 I will make a man more precious than fine gold; even a man
        than the golden wedge of Ophir.

013:013 Therefore I will shake the heavens, and the earth shall remove
        out of her place, in the wrath of the LORD of hosts, and in
        the day of his fierce anger.

013:014 And it shall be as the chased roe, and as a sheep that no man
        taketh up: they shall every man turn to his own people, and
        flee every one into his own land.

013:015 Every one that is found shall be thrust through; and every one
        that is joined unto them shall fall by the sword.

013:016 Their children also shall be dashed to pieces before their
        eyes; their houses shall be spoiled, and their wives ravished.

013:017 Behold, I will stir up the Medes against them, which shall not
        regard silver; and as for gold, they shall not delight in it.

013:018 Their bows also shall dash the young men to pieces; and they
        shall have no pity on the fruit of the womb; their eyes shall
        not spare children.

013:019 And Babylon, the glory of kingdoms, the beauty of the
        Chaldees' excellency, shall be as when God overthrew Sodom and
        Gomorrah.

013:020 It shall never be inhabited, neither shall it be dwelt in from
        generation to generation: neither shall the Arabian pitch tent
        there; neither shall the shepherds make their fold there.

013:021 But wild beasts of the desert shall lie there; and their
        houses shall be full of doleful creatures; and owls shall
        dwell there, and satyrs shall dance there.

013:022 And the wild beasts of the islands shall cry in their desolate
        houses, and dragons in their pleasant palaces: and her time is
        near to come, and her days shall not be prolonged.

014:001 For the LORD will have mercy on Jacob, and will yet choose
        Israel, and set them in their own land: and the strangers
        shall be joined with them, and they shall cleave to the house
        of Jacob.

014:002 And the people shall take them, and bring them to their place:
        and the house of Israel shall possess them in the land of the
        LORD for servants and handmaids: and they shall take them
        captives, whose captives they were; and they shall rule over
        their oppressors.

014:003 And it shall come to pass in the day that the LORD shall give
        thee rest from thy sorrow, and from thy fear, and from the
        hard bondage wherein thou wast made to serve,

014:004 That thou shalt take up this proverb against the king of
        Babylon, and say, How hath the oppressor ceased! the golden
        city ceased!

014:005 The LORD hath broken the staff of the wicked, and the sceptre
        of the rulers.

014:006 He who smote the people in wrath with a continual stroke, he
        that ruled the nations in anger, is persecuted, and none
        hindereth.

014:007 The whole earth is at rest, and is quiet: they break forth
        into singing.

014:008 Yea, the fir trees rejoice at thee, and the cedars of Lebanon,
        saying, Since thou art laid down, no feller is come up against
        us.

014:009 Hell from beneath is moved for thee to meet thee at thy
        coming: it stirreth up the dead for thee, even all the chief
        ones of the earth; it hath raised up from their thrones all
        the kings of the nations.

014:010 All they shall speak and say unto thee, Art thou also become
        weak as we? art thou become like unto us?

014:011 Thy pomp is brought down to the grave, and the noise of thy
        viols: the worm is spread under thee, and the worms cover
        thee.

014:012 How art thou fallen from heaven, O Lucifer, son of the
        morning! how art thou cut down to the ground, which didst
        weaken the nations!

014:013 For thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend into heaven,
        I will exalt my throne above the stars of God: I will sit also
        upon the mount of the congregation, in the sides of the north:

014:014 I will ascend above the heights of the clouds; I will be like
        the most High.

014:015 Yet thou shalt be brought down to hell, to the sides of the
        pit.

014:016 They that see thee shall narrowly look upon thee, and consider
        thee, saying, Is this the man that made the earth to tremble,
        that did shake kingdoms;

014:017 That made the world as a wilderness, and destroyed the cities
        thereof; that opened not the house of his prisoners?

014:018 All the kings of the nations, even all of them, lie in glory,
        every one in his own house.

014:019 But thou art cast out of thy grave like an abominable branch,
        and as the raiment of those that are slain, thrust through
        with a sword, that go down to the stones of the pit; as a
        carcase trodden under feet.

014:020 Thou shalt not be joined with them in burial, because thou
        hast destroyed thy land, and slain thy people: the seed of
        evildoers shall never be renowned.

014:021 Prepare slaughter for his children for the iniquity of their
        fathers; that they do not rise, nor possess the land, nor fill
        the face of the world with cities.

014:022 For I will rise up against them, saith the LORD of hosts, and
        cut off from Babylon the name, and remnant, and son, and
        nephew, saith the LORD.

014:023 I will also make it a possession for the bittern, and pools of
        water: and I will sweep it with the besom of destruction,
        saith the LORD of hosts.

014:024 The LORD of hosts hath sworn, saying, Surely as I have
        thought, so shall it come to pass; and as I have purposed, so
        shall it stand:

014:025 That I will break the Assyrian in my land, and upon my
        mountains tread him under foot: then shall his yoke depart
        from off them, and his burden depart from off their shoulders.

014:026 This is the purpose that is purposed upon the whole earth: and
        this is the hand that is stretched out upon all the nations.

014:027 For the LORD of hosts hath purposed, and who shall disannul
        it? and his hand is stretched out, and who shall turn it back?

014:028 In the year that king Ahaz died was this burden.

014:029 Rejoice not thou, whole Palestina, because the rod of him that
        smote thee is broken: for out of the serpent's root shall come
        forth a cockatrice, and his fruit shall be a fiery flying
        serpent.

014:030 And the firstborn of the poor shall feed, and the needy shall
        lie down in safety: and I will kill thy root with famine, and
        he shall slay thy remnant.

014:031 Howl, O gate; cry, O city; thou, whole Palestina, art
        dissolved: for there shall come from the north a smoke, and
        none shall be alone in his appointed times.

014:032 What shall one then answer the messengers of the nation? That
        the LORD hath founded Zion, and the poor of his people shall
        trust in it.

015:001 The burden of Moab. Because in the night Ar of Moab is laid
        waste, and brought to silence; because in the night Kir of
        Moab is laid waste, and brought to silence;

015:002 He is gone up to Bajith, and to Dibon, the high places, to
        weep: Moab shall howl over Nebo, and over Medeba: on all their
        heads shall be baldness, and every beard cut off.

015:003 In their streets they shall gird themselves with sackcloth: on
        the tops of their houses, and in their streets, every one
        shall howl, weeping abundantly.

015:004 And Heshbon shall cry, and Elealeh: their voice shall be heard
        even unto Jahaz: therefore the armed soldiers of Moab shall
        cry out; his life shall be grievous unto him.

015:005 My heart shall cry out for Moab; his fugitives shall flee unto
        Zoar, an heifer of three years old: for by the mounting up of
        Luhith with weeping shall they go it up; for in the way of
        Horonaim they shall raise up a cry of destruction.

015:006 For the waters of Nimrim shall be desolate: for the hay is
        withered away, the grass faileth, there is no green thing.

015:007 Therefore the abundance they have gotten, and that which they
        have laid up, shall they carry away to the brook of the
        willows.

015:008 For the cry is gone round about the borders of Moab; the
        howling thereof unto Eglaim, and the howling thereof unto
        Beerelim.

015:009 For the waters of Dimon shall be full of blood: for I will
        bring more upon Dimon, lions upon him that escapeth of Moab,
        and upon the remnant of the land.

016:001 Send ye the lamb to the ruler of the land from Sela to the
        wilderness, unto the mount of the daughter of Zion.

016:002 For it shall be, that, as a wandering bird cast out of the
        nest, so the daughters of Moab shall be at the fords of Arnon.

016:003 Take counsel, execute judgment; make thy shadow as the night
        in the midst of the noonday; hide the outcasts; bewray not him
        that wandereth.

016:004 Let mine outcasts dwell with thee, Moab; be thou a covert to
        them from the face of the spoiler: for the extortioner is at
        an end, the spoiler ceaseth, the oppressors are consumed out
        of the land.

016:005 And in mercy shall the throne be established: and he shall sit
        upon it in truth in the tabernacle of David, judging, and
        seeking judgment, and hasting righteousness.

016:006 We have heard of the pride of Moab; he is very proud: even of
        his haughtiness, and his pride, and his wrath: but his lies
        shall not be so.

016:007 Therefore shall Moab howl for Moab, every one shall howl: for
        the foundations of Kirhareseth shall ye mourn; surely they are
        stricken.

016:008 For the fields of Heshbon languish, and the vine of Sibmah:
        the lords of the heathen have broken down the principal plants
        thereof, they are come even unto Jazer, they wandered through
        the wilderness: her branches are stretched out, they are gone
        over the sea.

016:009 Therefore I will bewail with the weeping of Jazer the vine of
        Sibmah: I will water thee with my tears, O Heshbon, and
        Elealeh: for the shouting for thy summer fruits and for thy
        harvest is fallen.

016:010 And gladness is taken away, and joy out of the plentiful
        field; and in the vineyards there shall be no singing, neither
        shall there be shouting: the treaders shall tread out no wine
        in their presses; I have made their vintage shouting to cease.

016:011 Wherefore my bowels shall sound like an harp for Moab, and
        mine inward parts for Kirharesh.

016:012 And it shall come to pass, when it is seen that Moab is weary
        on the high place, that he shall come to his sanctuary to
        pray; but he shall not prevail.

016:013 This is the word that the LORD hath spoken concerning Moab
        since that time.

016:014 But now the LORD hath spoken, saying, Within three years, as
        the years of an hireling, and the glory of Moab shall be
        contemned, with all that great multitude; and the remnant
        shall be very small and feeble.

017:001 The burden of Damascus. Behold, Damascus is taken away from
        being a city, and it shall be a ruinous heap.

017:002 The cities of Aroer are forsaken: they shall be for flocks,
        which shall lie down, and none shall make them afraid.

017:003 The fortress also shall cease from Ephraim, and the kingdom
        from Damascus, and the remnant of Syria: they shall be as the
        glory of the children of Israel, saith the LORD of hosts.

017:004 And in that day it shall come to pass, that the glory of Jacob
        shall be made thin, and the fatness of his flesh shall wax
        lean.

017:005 And it shall be as when the harvestman gathereth the corn, and
        reapeth the ears with his arm; and it shall be as he that
        gathereth ears in the valley of Rephaim.

017:006 Yet gleaning grapes shall be left in it, as the shaking of an
        olive tree, two or three berries in the top of the uppermost
        bough, four or five in the outmost fruitful branches thereof,
        saith the LORD God of Israel.

017:007 At that day shall a man look to his Maker, and his eyes shall
        have respect to the Holy One of Israel.

017:008 And he shall not look to the altars, the work of his hands,
        neither shall respect that which his fingers have made, either
        the groves, or the images.

017:009 In that day shall his strong cities be as a forsaken bough,
        and an uppermost branch, which they left because of the
        children of Israel: and there shall be desolation.

017:010 Because thou hast forgotten the God of thy salvation, and hast
        not been mindful of the rock of thy strength, therefore shalt
        thou plant pleasant plants, and shalt set it with strange
        slips:

017:011 In the day shalt thou make thy plant to grow, and in the
        morning shalt thou make thy seed to flourish: but the harvest
        shall be a heap in the day of grief and of desperate sorrow.

017:012 Woe to the multitude of many people, which make a noise like
        the noise of the seas; and to the rushing of nations, that
        make a rushing like the rushing of mighty waters!

017:013 The nations shall rush like the rushing of many waters: but
        God shall rebuke them, and they shall flee far off, and shall
        be chased as the chaff of the mountains before the wind, and
        like a rolling thing before the whirlwind.

017:014 And behold at eveningtide trouble; and before the morning he
        is not. This is the portion of them that spoil us, and the lot
        of them that rob us.

018:001 Woe to the land shadowing with wings, which is beyond the
        rivers of Ethiopia:

018:002 That sendeth ambassadors by the sea, even in vessels of
        bulrushes upon the waters, saying, Go, ye swift messengers, to
        a nation scattered and peeled, to a people terrible from their
        beginning hitherto; a nation meted out and trodden down, whose
        land the rivers have spoiled!

018:003 All ye inhabitants of the world, and dwellers on the earth,
        see ye, when he lifteth up an ensign on the mountains; and
        when he bloweth a trumpet, hear ye.

018:004 For so the LORD said unto me, I will take my rest, and I will
        consider in my dwelling place like a clear heat upon herbs,
        and like a cloud of dew in the heat of harvest.

018:005 For afore the harvest, when the bud is perfect, and the sour
        grape is ripening in the flower, he shall both cut off the
        sprigs with pruning hooks, and take away and cut down the
        branches.

018:006 They shall be left together unto the fowls of the mountains,
        and to the beasts of the earth: and the fowls shall summer
        upon them, and all the beasts of the earth shall winter upon
        them.

018:007 In that time shall the present be brought unto the LORD of
        hosts of a people scattered and peeled, and from a people
        terrible from their beginning hitherto; a nation meted out and
        trodden under foot, whose land the rivers have spoiled, to the
        place of the name of the LORD of hosts, the mount Zion.

019:001 The burden of Egypt. Behold, the LORD rideth upon a swift
        cloud, and shall come into Egypt: and the idols of Egypt shall
        be moved at his presence, and the heart of Egypt shall melt in
        the midst of it.

019:002 And I will set the Egyptians against the Egyptians: and they
        shall fight every one against his brother, and every one
        against his neighbour; city against city, and kingdom against
        kingdom.

019:003 And the spirit of Egypt shall fail in the midst thereof; and I
        will destroy the counsel thereof: and they shall seek to the
        idols, and to the charmers, and to them that have familiar
        spirits, and to the wizards.

019:004 And the Egyptians will I give over into the hand of a cruel
        lord; and a fierce king shall rule over them, saith the Lord,
        the LORD of hosts.

019:005 And the waters shall fail from the sea, and the river shall be
        wasted and dried up.

019:006 And they shall turn the rivers far away; and the brooks of
        defence shall be emptied and dried up: the reeds and flags
        shall wither.

019:007 The paper reeds by the brooks, by the mouth of the brooks, and
        every thing sown by the brooks, shall wither, be driven away,
        and be no more.

019:008 The fishers also shall mourn, and all they that cast angle
        into the brooks shall lament, and they that spread nets upon
        the waters shall languish.

019:009 Moreover they that work in fine flax, and they that weave
        networks, shall be confounded.

019:010 And they shall be broken in the purposes thereof, all that
        make sluices and ponds for fish.

019:011 Surely the princes of Zoan are fools, the counsel of the wise
        counsellors of Pharaoh is become brutish: how say ye unto
        Pharaoh, I am the son of the wise, the son of ancient kings?

019:012 Where are they? where are thy wise men? and let them tell thee
        now, and let them know what the LORD of hosts hath purposed
        upon Egypt.

019:013 The princes of Zoan are become fools, the princes of Noph are
        deceived; they have also seduced Egypt, even they that are the
        stay of the tribes thereof.

019:014 The LORD hath mingled a perverse spirit in the midst thereof:
        and they have caused Egypt to err in every work thereof, as a
        drunken man staggereth in his vomit.

019:015 Neither shall there be any work for Egypt, which the head or
        tail, branch or rush, may do.

019:016 In that day shall Egypt be like unto women: and it shall be
        afraid and fear because of the shaking of the hand of the LORD
        of hosts, which he shaketh over it.

019:017 And the land of Judah shall be a terror unto Egypt, every one
        that maketh mention thereof shall be afraid in himself,
        because of the counsel of the LORD of hosts, which he hath
        determined against it.

019:018 In that day shall five cities in the land of Egypt speak the
        language of Canaan, and swear to the LORD of hosts; one shall
        be called, The city of destruction.

019:019 In that day shall there be an altar to the LORD in the midst
        of the land of Egypt, and a pillar at the border thereof to
        the LORD.

019:020 And it shall be for a sign and for a witness unto the LORD of
        hosts in the land of Egypt: for they shall cry unto the LORD
        because of the oppressors, and he shall send them a saviour,
        and a great one, and he shall deliver them.

019:021 And the LORD shall be known to Egypt, and the Egyptians shall
        know the LORD in that day, and shall do sacrifice and
        oblation; yea, they shall vow a vow unto the LORD, and perform
        it.

019:022 And the LORD shall smite Egypt: he shall smite and heal it:
        and they shall return even to the LORD, and he shall be
        intreated of them, and shall heal them.

019:023 In that day shall there be a highway out of Egypt to Assyria,
        and the Assyrian shall come into Egypt, and the Egyptian into
        Assyria, and the Egyptians shall serve with the Assyrians.

019:024 In that day shall Israel be the third with Egypt and with
        Assyria, even a blessing in the midst of the land:

019:025 Whom the LORD of hosts shall bless, saying, Blessed be Egypt
        my people, and Assyria the work of my hands, and Israel mine
        inheritance.

020:001 In the year that Tartan came unto Ashdod, (when Sargon the
        king of Assyria sent him,) and fought against Ashdod, and took
        it;

020:002 At the same time spake the LORD by Isaiah the son of Amoz,
        saying, Go and loose the sackcloth from off thy loins, and put
        off thy shoe from thy foot. And he did so, walking naked and
        barefoot.

020:003 And the LORD said, Like as my servant Isaiah hath walked naked
        and barefoot three years for a sign and wonder upon Egypt and
        upon Ethiopia;

020:004 So shall the king of Assyria lead away the Egyptians
        prisoners, and the Ethiopians captives, young and old, naked
        and barefoot, even with their buttocks uncovered, to the shame
        of Egypt.

020:005 And they shall be afraid and ashamed of Ethiopia their
        expectation, and of Egypt their glory.

020:006 And the inhabitant of this isle shall say in that day, Behold,
        such is our expectation, whither we flee for help to be
        delivered from the king of Assyria: and how shall we escape?

021:001 The burden of the desert of the sea. As whirlwinds in the
        south pass through; so it cometh from the desert, from a
        terrible land.

021:002 A grievous vision is declared unto me; the treacherous dealer
        dealeth treacherously, and the spoiler spoileth. Go up, O
        Elam: besiege, O Media; all the sighing thereof have I made to
        cease.

021:003 Therefore are my loins filled with pain: pangs have taken hold
        upon me, as the pangs of a woman that travaileth: I was bowed
        down at the hearing of it; I was dismayed at the seeing of it.

021:004 My heart panted, fearfulness affrighted me: the night of my
        pleasure hath he turned into fear unto me.

021:005 Prepare the table, watch in the watchtower, eat, drink: arise,
        ye princes, and anoint the shield.

021:006 For thus hath the LORD said unto me, Go, set a watchman, let
        him declare what he seeth.

021:007 And he saw a chariot with a couple of horsemen, a chariot of
        asses, and a chariot of camels; and he hearkened diligently
        with much heed:

021:008 And he cried, A lion: My lord, I stand continually upon the
        watchtower in the daytime, and I am set in my ward whole
        nights:

021:009 And, behold, here cometh a chariot of men, with a couple of
        horsemen. And he answered and said, Babylon is fallen, is
        fallen; and all the graven images of her gods he hath broken
        unto the ground.

021:010 O my threshing, and the corn of my floor: that which I have
        heard of the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel, have I declared
        unto you.

021:011 The burden of Dumah. He calleth to me out of Seir, Watchman,
        what of the night? Watchman, what of the night?

021:012 The watchman said, The morning cometh, and also the night: if
        ye will enquire, enquire ye: return, come.

021:013 The burden upon Arabia. In the forest in Arabia shall ye
        lodge, O ye travelling companies of Dedanim.

021:014 The inhabitants of the land of Tema brought water to him that
        was thirsty, they prevented with their bread him that fled.

021:015 For they fled from the swords, from the drawn sword, and from
        the bent bow, and from the grievousness of war.

021:016 For thus hath the LORD said unto me, Within a year, according
        to the years of an hireling, and all the glory of Kedar shall
        fail:

021:017 And the residue of the number of archers, the mighty men of
        the children of Kedar, shall be diminished: for the LORD God
        of Israel hath spoken it.

022:001 The burden of the valley of vision. What aileth thee now, that
        thou art wholly gone up to the housetops?

022:002 Thou that art full of stirs, a tumultuous city, joyous city:
        thy slain men are not slain with the sword, nor dead in
        battle.

022:003 All thy rulers are fled together, they are bound by the
        archers: all that are found in thee are bound together, which
        have fled from far.

022:004 Therefore said I, Look away from me; I will weep bitterly,
        labour not to comfort me, because of the spoiling of the
        daughter of my people.

022:005 For it is a day of trouble, and of treading down, and of
        perplexity by the Lord GOD of hosts in the valley of vision,
        breaking down the walls, and of crying to the mountains.

022:006 And Elam bare the quiver with chariots of men and horsemen,
        and Kir uncovered the shield.

022:007 And it shall come to pass, that thy choicest valleys shall be
        full of chariots, and the horsemen shall set themselves in
        array at the gate.

022:008 And he discovered the covering of Judah, and thou didst look
        in that day to the armour of the house of the forest.

022:009 Ye have seen also the breaches of the city of David, that they
        are many: and ye gathered together the waters of the lower
        pool.

022:010 And ye have numbered the houses of Jerusalem, and the houses
        have ye broken down to fortify the wall.

022:011 Ye made also a ditch between the two walls for the water of
        the old pool: but ye have not looked unto the maker thereof,
        neither had respect unto him that fashioned it long ago.

022:012 And in that day did the Lord GOD of hosts call to weeping, and
        to mourning, and to baldness, and to girding with sackcloth:

022:013 And behold joy and gladness, slaying oxen, and killing sheep,
        eating flesh, and drinking wine: let us eat and drink; for to
        morrow we shall die.

022:014 And it was revealed in mine ears by the LORD of hosts, Surely
        this iniquity shall not be purged from you till ye die, saith
        the Lord GOD of hosts.

022:015 Thus saith the Lord GOD of hosts, Go, get thee unto this
        treasurer, even unto Shebna, which is over the house, and say,

022:016 What hast thou here? and whom hast thou here, that thou hast
        hewed thee out a sepulchre here, as he that heweth him out a
        sepulchre on high, and that graveth an habitation for himself
        in a rock?

022:017 Behold, the LORD will carry thee away with a mighty captivity,
        and will surely cover thee.

022:018 He will surely violently turn and toss thee like a ball into a
        large country: there shalt thou die, and there the chariots of
        thy glory shall be the shame of thy lord's house.

022:019 And I will drive thee from thy station, and from thy state
        shall he pull thee down.

022:020 And it shall come to pass in that day, that I will call my
        servant Eliakim the son of Hilkiah:

022:021 And I will clothe him with thy robe, and strengthen him with
        thy girdle, and I will commit thy government into his hand:
        and he shall be a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and
        to the house of Judah.

022:022 And the key of the house of David will I lay upon his
        shoulder; so he shall open, and none shall shut; and he shall
        shut, and none shall open.

022:023 And I will fasten him as a nail in a sure place; and he shall
        be for a glorious throne to his father's house.

022:024 And they shall hang upon him all the glory of his father's
        house, the offspring and the issue, all vessels of small
        quantity, from the vessels of cups, even to all the vessels of
        flagons.

022:025 In that day, saith the LORD of hosts, shall the nail that is
        fastened in the sure place be removed, and be cut down, and
        fall; and the burden that was upon it shall be cut off: for
        the LORD hath spoken it.

023:001 The burden of Tyre. Howl, ye ships of Tarshish; for it is laid
        waste, so that there is no house, no entering in: from the
        land of Chittim it is revealed to them.

023:002 Be still, ye inhabitants of the isle; thou whom the merchants
        of Zidon, that pass over the sea, have replenished.

023:003 And by great waters the seed of Sihor, the harvest of the
        river, is her revenue; and she is a mart of nations.

023:004 Be thou ashamed, O Zidon: for the sea hath spoken, even the
        strength of the sea, saying, I travail not, nor bring forth
        children, neither do I nourish up young men, nor bring up
        virgins.

023:005 As at the report concerning Egypt, so shall they be sorely
        pained at the report of Tyre.

023:006 Pass ye over to Tarshish; howl, ye inhabitants of the isle.

023:007 Is this your joyous city, whose antiquity is of ancient days?
        her own feet shall carry her afar off to sojourn.

023:008 Who hath taken this counsel against Tyre, the crowning city,
        whose merchants are princes, whose traffickers are the
        honourable of the earth?

023:009 The LORD of hosts hath purposed it, to stain the pride of all
        glory, and to bring into contempt all the honourable of the
        earth.

023:010 Pass through thy land as a river, O daughter of Tarshish:
        there is no more strength.

023:011 He stretched out his hand over the sea, he shook the kingdoms:
        the LORD hath given a commandment against the merchant city,
        to destroy the strong holds thereof.

023:012 And he said, Thou shalt no more rejoice, O thou oppressed
        virgin, daughter of Zidon: arise, pass over to Chittim; there
        also shalt thou have no rest.

023:013 Behold the land of the Chaldeans; this people was not, till
        the Assyrian founded it for them that dwell in the wilderness:
        they set up the towers thereof, they raised up the palaces
        thereof; and he brought it to ruin.

023:014 Howl, ye ships of Tarshish: for your strength is laid waste.

023:015 And it shall come to pass in that day, that Tyre shall be
        forgotten seventy years, according to the days of one king:
        after the end of seventy years shall Tyre sing as an harlot.

023:016 Take an harp, go about the city, thou harlot that hast been
        forgotten; make sweet melody, sing many songs, that thou
        mayest be remembered.

023:017 And it shall come to pass after the end of seventy years, that
        the LORD will visit Tyre, and she shall turn to her hire, and
        shall commit fornication with all the kingdoms of the world
        upon the face of the earth.

023:018 And her merchandise and her hire shall be holiness to the
        LORD: it shall not be treasured nor laid up; for her
        merchandise shall be for them that dwell before the LORD, to
        eat sufficiently, and for durable clothing.

024:001 Behold, the LORD maketh the earth empty, and maketh it waste,
        and turneth it upside down, and scattereth abroad the
        inhabitants thereof.

024:002 And it shall be, as with the people, so with the priest; as
        with the servant, so with his master; as with the maid, so
        with her mistress; as with the buyer, so with the seller; as
        with the lender, so with the borrower; as with the taker of
        usury, so with the giver of usury to him.

024:003 The land shall be utterly emptied, and utterly spoiled: for
        the LORD hath spoken this word.

024:004 The earth mourneth and fadeth away, the world languisheth and
        fadeth away, the haughty people of the earth do languish.

024:005 The earth also is defiled under the inhabitants thereof;
        because they have transgressed the laws, changed the
        ordinance, broken the everlasting covenant.

024:006 Therefore hath the curse devoured the earth, and they that
        dwell therein are desolate: therefore the inhabitants of the
        earth are burned, and few men left.

024:007 The new wine mourneth, the vine languisheth, all the
        merryhearted do sigh.

024:008 The mirth of tabrets ceaseth, the noise of them that rejoice
        endeth, the joy of the harp ceaseth.

024:009 They shall not drink wine with a song; strong drink shall be
        bitter to them that drink it.

024:010 The city of confusion is broken down: every house is shut up,
        that no man may come in.

024:011 There is a crying for wine in the streets; all joy is
        darkened, the mirth of the land is gone.

024:012 In the city is left desolation, and the gate is smitten with
        destruction.

024:013 When thus it shall be in the midst of the land among the
        people, there shall be as the shaking of an olive tree, and as
        the gleaning grapes when the vintage is done.

024:014 They shall lift up their voice, they shall sing for the
        majesty of the LORD, they shall cry aloud from the sea.

024:015 Wherefore glorify ye the LORD in the fires, even the name of
        the LORD God of Israel in the isles of the sea.

024:016 From the uttermost part of the earth have we heard songs, even
        glory to the righteous. But I said, My leanness, my leanness,
        woe unto me! the treacherous dealers have dealt treacherously;
        yea, the treacherous dealers have dealt very treacherously.

024:017 Fear, and the pit, and the snare, are upon thee, O inhabitant
        of the earth.

024:018 And it shall come to pass, that he who fleeth from the noise
        of the fear shall fall into the pit; and he that cometh up out
        of the midst of the pit shall be taken in the snare: for the
        windows from on high are open, and the foundations of the
        earth do shake.

024:019 The earth is utterly broken down, the earth is clean
        dissolved, the earth is moved exceedingly.

024:020 The earth shall reel to and fro like a drunkard, and shall be
        removed like a cottage; and the transgression thereof shall be
        heavy upon it; and it shall fall, and not rise again.

024:021 And it shall come to pass in that day, that the LORD shall
        punish the host of the high ones that are on high, and the
        kings of the earth upon the earth.

024:022 And they shall be gathered together, as prisoners are gathered
        in the pit, and shall be shut up in the prison, and after many
        days shall they be visited.

024:023 Then the moon shall be confounded, and the sun ashamed, when
        the LORD of hosts shall reign in mount Zion, and in Jerusalem,
        and before his ancients gloriously.

025:001 O Lord, thou art my God; I will exalt thee, I will praise thy
        name; for thou hast done wonderful things; thy counsels of old
        are faithfulness and truth.

025:002 For thou hast made of a city an heap; of a defenced city a
        ruin: a palace of strangers to be no city; it shall never be
        built.

025:003 Therefore shall the strong people glorify thee, the city of
        the terrible nations shall fear thee.

025:004 For thou hast been a strength to the poor, a strength to the
        needy in his distress, a refuge from the storm, a shadow from
        the heat, when the blast of the terrible ones is as a storm
        against the wall.

025:005 Thou shalt bring down the noise of strangers, as the heat in a
        dry place; even the heat with the shadow of a cloud: the
        branch of the terrible ones shall be brought low.

025:006 And in this mountain shall the LORD of hosts make unto all
        people a feast of fat things, a feast of wines on the lees, of
        fat things full of marrow, of wines on the lees well refined.

025:007 And he will destroy in this mountain the face of the covering
        cast over all people, and the vail that is spread over all
        nations.

025:008 He will swallow up death in victory; and the Lord GOD will
        wipe away tears from off all faces; and the rebuke of his
        people shall he take away from off all the earth: for the LORD
        hath spoken it.

025:009 And it shall be said in that day, Lo, this is our God; we have
        waited for him, and he will save us: this is the LORD; we have
        waited for him, we will be glad and rejoice in his salvation.

025:010 For in this mountain shall the hand of the LORD rest, and Moab
        shall be trodden down under him, even as straw is trodden down
        for the dunghill.

025:011 And he shall spread forth his hands in the midst of them, as
        he that swimmeth spreadeth forth his hands to swim: and he
        shall bring down their pride together with the spoils of their
        hands.

025:012 And the fortress of the high fort of thy walls shall he bring
        down, lay low, and bring to the ground, even to the dust.

026:001 In that day shall this song be sung in the land of Judah; We
        have a strong city; salvation will God appoint for walls and
        bulwarks.

026:002 Open ye the gates, that the righteous nation which keepeth the
        truth may enter in.

026:003 Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on
        thee: because he trusteth in thee.

026:004 Trust ye in the LORD for ever: for in the LORD JEHOVAH is
        everlasting strength:

026:005 For he bringeth down them that dwell on high; the lofty city,
        he layeth it low; he layeth it low, even to the ground; he
        bringeth it even to the dust.

026:006 The foot shall tread it down, even the feet of the poor, and
        the steps of the needy.

026:007 The way of the just is uprightness: thou, most upright, dost
        weigh the path of the just.

026:008 Yea, in the way of thy judgments, O LORD, have we waited for
        thee; the desire of our soul is to thy name, and to the
        remembrance of thee.

026:009 With my soul have I desired thee in the night; yea, with my
        spirit within me will I seek thee early: for when thy
        judgments are in the earth, the inhabitants of the world will
        learn righteousness.

026:010 Let favour be shewed to the wicked, yet will he not learn
        righteousness: in the land of uprightness will he deal
        unjustly, and will not behold the majesty of the LORD.

026:011 LORD, when thy hand is lifted up, they will not see: but they
        shall see, and be ashamed for their envy at the people; yea,
        the fire of thine enemies shall devour them.

026:012 LORD, thou wilt ordain peace for us: for thou also hast
        wrought all our works in us.

026:013 O LORD our God, other lords beside thee have had dominion over
        us: but by thee only will we make mention of thy name.

026:014 They are dead, they shall not live; they are deceased, they
        shall not rise: therefore hast thou visited and destroyed
        them, and made all their memory to perish.

026:015 Thou hast increased the nation, O LORD, thou hast increased
        the nation: thou art glorified: thou hadst removed it far unto
        all the ends of the earth.

026:016 LORD, in trouble have they visited thee, they poured out a
        prayer when thy chastening was upon them.

026:017 Like as a woman with child, that draweth near the time of her
        delivery, is in pain, and crieth out in her pangs; so have we
        been in thy sight, O LORD.

026:018 We have been with child, we have been in pain, we have as it
        were brought forth wind; we have not wrought any deliverance
        in the earth; neither have the inhabitants of the world
        fallen.

026:019 Thy dead men shall live, together with my dead body shall they
        arise. Awake and sing, ye that dwell in dust: for thy dew is
        as the dew of herbs, and the earth shall cast out the dead.

026:020 Come, my people, enter thou into thy chambers, and shut thy
        doors about thee: hide thyself as it were for a little moment,
        until the indignation be overpast.

026:021 For, behold, the LORD cometh out of his place to punish the
        inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity: the earth also
        shall disclose her blood, and shall no more cover her slain.

027:001 In that day the LORD with his sore and great and strong sword
        shall punish leviathan the piercing serpent, even leviathan
        that crooked serpent; and he shall slay the dragon that is in
        the sea.

027:002 In that day sing ye unto her, A vineyard of red wine.

027:003 I the LORD do keep it; I will water it every moment: lest any
        hurt it, I will keep it night and day.

027:004 Fury is not in me: who would set the briers and thorns against
        me in battle? I would go through them, I would burn them
        together.

027:005 Or let him take hold of my strength, that he may make peace
        with me; and he shall make peace with me.

027:006 He shall cause them that come of Jacob to take root: Israel
        shall blossom and bud, and fill the face of the world with
        fruit.

027:007 Hath he smitten him, as he smote those that smote him? or is
        he slain according to the slaughter of them that are slain by
        him?

027:008 In measure, when it shooteth forth, thou wilt debate with it:
        he stayeth his rough wind in the day of the east wind.

027:009 By this therefore shall the iniquity of Jacob be purged; and
        this is all the fruit to take away his sin; when he maketh all
        the stones of the altar as chalkstones that are beaten in
        sunder, the groves and images shall not stand up.

027:010 Yet the defenced city shall be desolate, and the habitation
        forsaken, and left like a wilderness: there shall the calf
        feed, and there shall he lie down, and consume the branches
        thereof.

027:011 When the boughs thereof are withered, they shall be broken
        off: the women come, and set them on fire: for it is a people
        of no understanding: therefore he that made them will not have
        mercy on them, and he that formed them will shew them no
        favour.

027:012 And it shall come to pass in that day, that the LORD shall
        beat off from the channel of the river unto the stream of
        Egypt, and ye shall be gathered one by one, O ye children of
        Israel.

027:013 And it shall come to pass in that day, that the great trumpet
        shall be blown, and they shall come which were ready to perish
        in the land of Assyria, and the outcasts in the land of Egypt,
        and shall worship the LORD in the holy mount at Jerusalem.

028:001 Woe to the crown of pride, to the drunkards of Ephraim, whose
        glorious beauty is a fading flower, which are on the head of
        the fat valleys of them that are overcome with wine!

028:002 Behold, the Lord hath a mighty and strong one, which as a
        tempest of hail and a destroying storm, as a flood of mighty
        waters overflowing, shall cast down to the earth with the
        hand.

028:003 The crown of pride, the drunkards of Ephraim, shall be trodden
        under feet:

028:004 And the glorious beauty, which is on the head of the fat
        valley, shall be a fading flower, and as the hasty fruit
        before the summer; which when he that looketh upon it seeth,
        while it is yet in his hand he eateth it up.

028:005 In that day shall the LORD of hosts be for a crown of glory,
        and for a diadem of beauty, unto the residue of his people,

028:006 And for a spirit of judgment to him that sitteth in judgment,
        and for strength to them that turn the battle to the gate.

028:007 But they also have erred through wine, and through strong
        drink are out of the way; the priest and the prophet have
        erred through strong drink, they are swallowed up of wine,
        they are out of the way through strong drink; they err in
        vision, they stumble in judgment.

028:008 For all tables are full of vomit and filthiness, so that there
        is no place clean.

028:009 Whom shall he teach knowledge? and whom shall he make to
        understand doctrine? them that are weaned from the milk, and
        drawn from the breasts.

028:010 For precept must be upon precept, precept upon precept; line
        upon line, line upon line; here a little, and there a little:

028:011 For with stammering lips and another tongue will he speak to
        this people.

028:012 To whom he said, This is the rest wherewith ye may cause the
        weary to rest; and this is the refreshing: yet they would not
        hear.

028:013 But the word of the LORD was unto them precept upon precept,
        precept upon precept; line upon line, line upon line; here a
        little, and there a little; that they might go, and fall
        backward, and be broken, and snared, and taken.

028:014 Wherefore hear the word of the LORD, ye scornful men, that
        rule this people which is in Jerusalem.

028:015 Because ye have said, We have made a covenant with death, and
        with hell are we at agreement; when the overflowing scourge
        shall pass through, it shall not come unto us: for we have
        made lies our refuge, and under falsehood have we hid
        ourselves:

028:016 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD, Behold, I lay in Zion for a
        foundation a stone, a tried stone, a precious corner stone, a
        sure foundation: he that believeth shall not make haste.

028:017 Judgment also will I lay to the line, and righteousness to the
        plummet: and the hail shall sweep away the refuge of lies, and
        the waters shall overflow the hiding place.

028:018 And your covenant with death shall be disannulled, and your
        agreement with hell shall not stand; when the overflowing
        scourge shall pass through, then ye shall be trodden down by
        it.

028:019 From the time that it goeth forth it shall take you: for
        morning by morning shall it pass over, by day and by night:
        and it shall be a vexation only to understand the report.

028:020 For the bed is shorter than that a man can stretch himself on
        it: and the covering narrower than that he can wrap himself in
        it.

028:021 For the LORD shall rise up as in mount Perazim, he shall be
        wroth as in the valley of Gibeon, that he may do his work, his
        strange work; and bring to pass his act, his strange act.

028:022 Now therefore be ye not mockers, lest your bands be made
        strong: for I have heard from the Lord GOD of hosts a
        consumption, even determined upon the whole earth.

028:023 Give ye ear, and hear my voice; hearken, and hear my speech.

028:024 Doth the plowman plow all day to sow? doth he open and break
        the clods of his ground?

028:025 When he hath made plain the face thereof, doth he not cast
        abroad the fitches, and scatter the cummin, and cast in the
        principal wheat and the appointed barley and the rie in their
        place?

028:026 For his God doth instruct him to discretion, and doth teach
        him.

028:027 For the fitches are not threshed with a threshing instrument,
        neither is a cart wheel turned about upon the cummin; but the
        fitches are beaten out with a staff, and the cummin with a
        rod.

028:028 Bread corn is bruised; because he will not ever be threshing
        it, nor break it with the wheel of his cart, nor bruise it
        with his horsemen.

028:029 This also cometh forth from the LORD of hosts, which is
        wonderful in counsel, and excellent in working.

029:001 Woe to Ariel, to Ariel, the city where David dwelt! add ye
        year to year; let them kill sacrifices.

029:002 Yet I will distress Ariel, and there shall be heaviness and
        sorrow: and it shall be unto me as Ariel.

029:003 And I will camp against thee round about, and will lay siege
        against thee with a mount, and I will raise forts against
        thee.

029:004 And thou shalt be brought down, and shalt speak out of the
        ground, and thy speech shall be low out of the dust, and thy
        voice shall be, as of one that hath a familiar spirit, out of
        the ground, and thy speech shall whisper out of the dust.

029:005 Moreover the multitude of thy strangers shall be like small
        dust, and the multitude of the terrible ones shall be as chaff
        that passeth away: yea, it shall be at an instant suddenly.

029:006 Thou shalt be visited of the LORD of hosts with thunder, and
        with earthquake, and great noise, with storm and tempest, and
        the flame of devouring fire.

029:007 And the multitude of all the nations that fight against Ariel,
        even all that fight against her and her munition, and that
        distress her, shall be as a dream of a night vision.

029:008 It shall even be as when an hungry man dreameth, and, behold,
        he eateth; but he awaketh, and his soul is empty: or as when a
        thirsty man dreameth, and, behold, he drinketh; but he
        awaketh, and, behold, he is faint, and his soul hath appetite:
        so shall the multitude of all the nations be, that fight
        against mount Zion.

029:009 Stay yourselves, and wonder; cry ye out, and cry: they are
        drunken, but not with wine; they stagger, but not with strong
        drink.

029:010 For the LORD hath poured out upon you the spirit of deep
        sleep, and hath closed your eyes: the prophets and your
        rulers, the seers hath he covered.

029:011 And the vision of all is become unto you as the words of a
        book that is sealed, which men deliver to one that is learned,
        saying, Read this, I pray thee: and he saith, I cannot; for it
        is sealed:

029:012 And the book is delivered to him that is not learned, saying,
        Read this, I pray thee: and he saith, I am not learned.

029:013 Wherefore the Lord said, Forasmuch as this people draw near me
        with their mouth, and with their lips do honour me, but have
        removed their heart far from me, and their fear toward me is
        taught by the precept of men:

029:014 Therefore, behold, I will proceed to do a marvellous work
        among this people, even a marvellous work and a wonder: for
        the wisdom of their wise men shall perish, and the
        understanding of their prudent men shall be hid.

029:015 Woe unto them that seek deep to hide their counsel from the
        LORD, and their works are in the dark, and they say, Who seeth
        us? and who knoweth us?

029:016 Surely your turning of things upside down shall be esteemed as
        the potter's clay: for shall the work say of him that made it,
        He made me not? or shall the thing framed say of him that
        framed it, He had no understanding?

029:017 Is it not yet a very little while, and Lebanon shall be turned
        into a fruitful field, and the fruitful field shall be
        esteemed as a forest?

029:018 And in that day shall the deaf hear the words of the book, and
        the eyes of the blind shall see out of obscurity, and out of
        darkness.

029:019 The meek also shall increase their joy in the LORD, and the
        poor among men shall rejoice in the Holy One of Israel.

029:020 For the terrible one is brought to nought, and the scorner is
        consumed, and all that watch for iniquity are cut off:

029:021 That make a man an offender for a word, and lay a snare for
        him that reproveth in the gate, and turn aside the just for a
        thing of nought.

029:022 Therefore thus saith the LORD, who redeemed Abraham,
        concerning the house of Jacob, Jacob shall not now be ashamed,
        neither shall his face now wax pale.

029:023 But when he seeth his children, the work of mine hands, in the
        midst of him, they shall sanctify my name, and sanctify the
        Holy One of Jacob, and shall fear the God of Israel.

029:024 They also that erred in spirit shall come to understanding,
        and they that murmured shall learn doctrine.

030:001 Woe to the rebellious children, saith the LORD, that take
        counsel, but not of me; and that cover with a covering, but
        not of my spirit, that they may add sin to sin:

030:002 That walk to go down into Egypt, and have not asked at my
        mouth; to strengthen themselves in the strength of Pharaoh,
        and to trust in the shadow of Egypt!

030:003 Therefore shall the strength of Pharaoh be your shame, and the
        trust in the shadow of Egypt your confusion.

030:004 For his princes were at Zoan, and his ambassadors came to
        Hanes.

030:005 They were all ashamed of a people that could not profit them,
        nor be an help nor profit, but a shame, and also a reproach.

030:006 The burden of the beasts of the south: into the land of
        trouble and anguish, from whence come the young and old lion,
        the viper and fiery flying serpent, they will carry their
        riches upon the shoulders of young asses, and their treasures
        upon the bunches of camels, to a people that shall not profit
        them.

030:007 For the Egyptians shall help in vain, and to no purpose:
        therefore have I cried concerning this, Their strength is to
        sit still.

030:008 Now go, write it before them in a table, and note it in a
        book, that it may be for the time to come for ever and ever:

030:009 That this is a rebellious people, lying children, children
        that will not hear the law of the LORD:

030:010 Which say to the seers, See not; and to the prophets, Prophesy
        not unto us right things, speak unto us smooth things,
        prophesy deceits:

030:011 Get you out of the way, turn aside out of the path, cause the
        Holy One of Israel to cease from before us.

030:012 Wherefore thus saith the Holy One of Israel, Because ye
        despise this word, and trust in oppression and perverseness,
        and stay thereon:

030:013 Therefore this iniquity shall be to you as a breach ready to
        fall, swelling out in a high wall, whose breaking cometh
        suddenly at an instant.

030:014 And he shall break it as the breaking of the potters' vessel
        that is broken in pieces; he shall not spare: so that there
        shall not be found in the bursting of it a sherd to take fire
        from the hearth, or to take water withal out of the pit.

030:015 For thus saith the Lord GOD, the Holy One of Israel; In
        returning and rest shall ye be saved; in quietness and in
        confidence shall be your strength: and ye would not.

030:016 But ye said, No; for we will flee upon horses; therefore shall
        ye flee: and, We will ride upon the swift; therefore shall
        they that pursue you be swift.

030:017 One thousand shall flee at the rebuke of one; at the rebuke of
        five shall ye flee: till ye be left as a beacon upon the top
        of a mountain, and as an ensign on an hill.

030:018 And therefore will the LORD wait, that he may be gracious unto
        you, and therefore will he be exalted, that he may have mercy
        upon you: for the LORD is a God of judgment: blessed are all
        they that wait for him.

030:019 For the people shall dwell in Zion at Jerusalem: thou shalt
        weep no more: he will be very gracious unto thee at the voice
        of thy cry; when he shall hear it, he will answer thee.

030:020 And though the Lord give you the bread of adversity, and the
        water of affliction, yet shall not thy teachers be removed
        into a corner any more, but thine eyes shall see thy teachers:

030:021 And thine ears shall hear a word behind thee, saying, This is
        the way, walk ye in it, when ye turn to the right hand, and
        when ye turn to the left.

030:022 Ye shall defile also the covering of thy graven images of
        silver, and the ornament of thy molten images of gold: thou
        shalt cast them away as a menstruous cloth; thou shalt say
        unto it, Get thee hence.

030:023 Then shall he give the rain of thy seed, that thou shalt sow
        the ground withal; and bread of the increase of the earth, and
        it shall be fat and plenteous: in that day shall thy cattle
        feed in large pastures.

030:024 The oxen likewise and the young asses that ear the ground
        shall eat clean provender, which hath been winnowed with the
        shovel and with the fan.

030:025 And there shall be upon every high mountain, and upon every
        high hill, rivers and streams of waters in the day of the
        great slaughter, when the towers fall.

030:026 Moreover the light of the moon shall be as the light of the
        sun, and the light of the sun shall be sevenfold, as the light
        of seven days, in the day that the LORD bindeth up the breach
        of his people, and healeth the stroke of their wound.

030:027 Behold, the name of the LORD cometh from far, burning with his
        anger, and the burden thereof is heavy: his lips are full of
        indignation, and his tongue as a devouring fire:

030:028 And his breath, as an overflowing stream, shall reach to the
        midst of the neck, to sift the nations with the sieve of
        vanity: and there shall be a bridle in the jaws of the people,
        causing them to err.

030:029 Ye shall have a song, as in the night when a holy solemnity is
        kept; and gladness of heart, as when one goeth with a pipe to
        come into the mountain of the LORD, to the mighty One of
        Israel.

030:030 And the LORD shall cause his glorious voice to be heard, and
        shall shew the lighting down of his arm, with the indignation
        of his anger, and with the flame of a devouring fire, with
        scattering, and tempest, and hailstones.

030:031 For through the voice of the LORD shall the Assyrian be beaten
        down, which smote with a rod.

030:032 And in every place where the grounded staff shall pass, which
        the LORD shall lay upon him, it shall be with tabrets and
        harps: and in battles of shaking will he fight with it.

030:033 For Tophet is ordained of old; yea, for the king it is
        prepared; he hath made it deep and large: the pile thereof is
        fire and much wood; the breath of the LORD, like a stream of
        brimstone, doth kindle it.

031:001 Woe to them that go down to Egypt for help; and stay on
        horses, and trust in chariots, because they are many; and in
        horsemen, because they are very strong; but they look not unto
        the Holy One of Israel, neither seek the LORD!

031:002 Yet he also is wise, and will bring evil, and will not call
        back his words: but will arise against the house of the
        evildoers, and against the help of them that work iniquity.

031:003 Now the Egyptians are men, and not God; and their horses
        flesh, and not spirit. When the LORD shall stretch out his
        hand, both he that helpeth shall fall, and he that is holpen
        shall fall down, and they all shall fail together.

031:004 For thus hath the LORD spoken unto me, Like as the lion and
        the young lion roaring on his prey, when a multitude of
        shepherds is called forth against him, he will not be afraid
        of their voice, nor abase himself for the noise of them: so
        shall the LORD of hosts come down to fight for mount Zion, and
        for the hill thereof.

031:005 As birds flying, so will the LORD of hosts defend Jerusalem;
        defending also he will deliver it; and passing over he will
        preserve it.

031:006 Turn ye unto him from whom the children of Israel have deeply
        revolted.

031:007 For in that day every man shall cast away his idols of silver,
        and his idols of gold, which your own hands have made unto you
        for a sin.

031:008 Then shall the Assyrian fall with the sword, not of a mighty
        man; and the sword, not of a mean man, shall devour him: but
        he shall flee from the sword, and his young men shall be
        discomfited.

031:009 And he shall pass over to his strong hold for fear, and his
        princes shall be afraid of the ensign, saith the LORD, whose
        fire is in Zion, and his furnace in Jerusalem.

032:001 Behold, a king shall reign in righteousness, and princes shall
        rule in judgment.

032:002 And a man shall be as an hiding place from the wind, and a
        covert from the tempest; as rivers of water in a dry place, as
        the shadow of a great rock in a weary land.

032:003 And the eyes of them that see shall not be dim, and the ears
        of them that hear shall hearken.

032:004 The heart also of the rash shall understand knowledge, and the
        tongue of the stammerers shall be ready to speak plainly.

032:005 The vile person shall be no more called liberal, nor the churl
        said to be bountiful.

032:006 For the vile person will speak villany, and his heart will
        work iniquity, to practise hypocrisy, and to utter error
        against the LORD, to make empty the soul of the hungry, and he
        will cause the drink of the thirsty to fail.

032:007 The instruments also of the churl are evil: he deviseth wicked
        devices to destroy the poor with lying words, even when the
        needy speaketh right.

032:008 But the liberal deviseth liberal things; and by liberal things
        shall he stand.

032:009 Rise up, ye women that are at ease; hear my voice, ye careless
        daughters; give ear unto my speech.

032:010 Many days and years shall ye be troubled, ye careless women:
        for the vintage shall fail, the gathering shall not come.

032:011 Tremble, ye women that are at ease; be troubled, ye careless
        ones: strip you, and make you bare, and gird sackcloth upon
        your loins.

032:012 They shall lament for the teats, for the pleasant fields, for
        the fruitful vine.

032:013 Upon the land of my people shall come up thorns and briers;
        yea, upon all the houses of joy in the joyous city:

032:014 Because the palaces shall be forsaken; the multitude of the
        city shall be left; the forts and towers shall be for dens for
        ever, a joy of wild asses, a pasture of flocks;

032:015 Until the spirit be poured upon us from on high, and the
        wilderness be a fruitful field, and the fruitful field be
        counted for a forest.

032:016 Then judgment shall dwell in the wilderness, and righteousness
        remain in the fruitful field.

032:017 And the work of righteousness shall be peace; and the effect
        of righteousness quietness and assurance for ever.

032:018 And my people shall dwell in a peaceable habitation, and in
        sure dwellings, and in quiet resting places;

032:019 When it shall hail, coming down on the forest; and the city
        shall be low in a low place.

032:020 Blessed are ye that sow beside all waters, that send forth
        thither the feet of the ox and the ass.

033:001 Woe to thee that spoilest, and thou wast not spoiled; and
        dealest treacherously, and they dealt not treacherously with
        thee! when thou shalt cease to spoil, thou shalt be spoiled;
        and when thou shalt make an end to deal treacherously, they
        shall deal treacherously with thee.

033:002 O LORD, be gracious unto us; we have waited for thee: be thou
        their arm every morning, our salvation also in the time of
        trouble.

033:003 At the noise of the tumult the people fled; at the lifting up
        of thyself the nations were scattered.

033:004 And your spoil shall be gathered like the gathering of the
        caterpiller: as the running to and fro of locusts shall he run
        upon them.

033:005 The LORD is exalted; for he dwelleth on high: he hath filled
        Zion with judgment and righteousness.

033:006 And wisdom and knowledge shall be the stability of thy times,
        and strength of salvation: the fear of the LORD is his
        treasure.

033:007 Behold, their valiant ones shall cry without: the ambassadors
        of peace shall weep bitterly.

033:008 The highways lie waste, the wayfaring man ceaseth: he hath
        broken the covenant, he hath despised the cities, he regardeth
        no man.

033:009 The earth mourneth and languisheth: Lebanon is ashamed and
        hewn down: Sharon is like a wilderness; and Bashan and Carmel
        shake off their fruits.

033:010 Now will I rise, saith the LORD; now will I be exalted; now
        will I lift up myself.

033:011 Ye shall conceive chaff, ye shall bring forth stubble: your
        breath, as fire, shall devour you.

033:012 And the people shall be as the burnings of lime: as thorns cut
        up shall they be burned in the fire.

033:013 Hear, ye that are far off, what I have done; and, ye that are
        near, acknowledge my might.

033:014 The sinners in Zion are afraid; fearfulness hath surprised the
        hypocrites. Who among us shall dwell with the devouring fire?
        who among us shall dwell with everlasting burnings?

033:015 He that walketh righteously, and speaketh uprightly; he that
        despiseth the gain of oppressions, that shaketh his hands from
        holding of bribes, that stoppeth his ears from hearing of
        blood, and shutteth his eyes from seeing evil;

033:016 He shall dwell on high: his place of defence shall be the
        munitions of rocks: bread shall be given him; his waters shall
        be sure.

033:017 Thine eyes shall see the king in his beauty: they shall behold
        the land that is very far off.

033:018 Thine heart shall meditate terror. Where is the scribe? where
        is the receiver? where is he that counted the towers?

033:019 Thou shalt not see a fierce people, a people of a deeper
        speech than thou canst perceive; of a stammering tongue, that
        thou canst not understand.

033:020 Look upon Zion, the city of our solemnities: thine eyes shall
        see Jerusalem a quiet habitation, a tabernacle that shall not
        be taken down; not one of the stakes thereof shall ever be
        removed, neither shall any of the cords thereof be broken.

033:021 But there the glorious LORD will be unto us a place of broad
        rivers and streams; wherein shall go no galley with oars,
        neither shall gallant ship pass thereby.

033:022 For the LORD is our judge, the LORD is our lawgiver, the LORD
        is our king; he will save us.

033:023 Thy tacklings are loosed; they could not well strengthen their
        mast, they could not spread the sail: then is the prey of a
        great spoil divided; the lame take the prey.

033:024 And the inhabitant shall not say, I am sick: the people that
        dwell therein shall be forgiven their iniquity.

034:001 Come near, ye nations, to hear; and hearken, ye people: let
        the earth hear, and all that is therein; the world, and all
        things that come forth of it.

034:002 For the indignation of the LORD is upon all nations, and his
        fury upon all their armies: he hath utterly destroyed them, he
        hath delivered them to the slaughter.

034:003 Their slain also shall be cast out, and their stink shall come
        up out of their carcases, and the mountains shall be melted
        with their blood.

034:004 And all the host of heaven shall be dissolved, and the heavens
        shall be rolled together as a scroll: and all their host shall
        fall down, as the leaf falleth off from the vine, and as a
        falling fig from the fig tree.

034:005 For my sword shall be bathed in heaven: behold, it shall come
        down upon Idumea, and upon the people of my curse, to
        judgment.

034:006 The sword of the LORD is filled with blood, it is made fat
        with fatness, and with the blood of lambs and goats, with the
        fat of the kidneys of rams: for the LORD hath a sacrifice in
        Bozrah, and a great slaughter in the land of Idumea.

034:007 And the unicorns shall come down with them, and the bullocks
        with the bulls; and their land shall be soaked with blood, and
        their dust made fat with fatness.

034:008 For it is the day of the LORD's vengeance, and the year of
        recompences for the controversy of Zion.

034:009 And the streams thereof shall be turned into pitch, and the
        dust thereof into brimstone, and the land thereof shall become
        burning pitch.

034:010 It shall not be quenched night nor day; the smoke thereof
        shall go up for ever: from generation to generation it shall
        lie waste; none shall pass through it for ever and ever.

034:011 But the cormorant and the bittern shall possess it; the owl
        also and the raven shall dwell in it: and he shall stretch out
        upon it the line of confusion, and the stones of emptiness.

034:012 They shall call the nobles thereof to the kingdom, but none
        shall be there, and all her princes shall be nothing.

034:013 And thorns shall come up in her palaces, nettles and brambles
        in the fortresses thereof: and it shall be an habitation of
        dragons, and a court for owls.

034:014 The wild beasts of the desert shall also meet with the wild
        beasts of the island, and the satyr shall cry to his fellow;
        the screech owl also shall rest there, and find for herself a
        place of rest.

034:015 There shall the great owl make her nest, and lay, and hatch,
        and gather under her shadow: there shall the vultures also be
        gathered, every one with her mate.

034:016 Seek ye out of the book of the LORD, and read: no one of these
        shall fail, none shall want her mate: for my mouth it hath
        commanded, and his spirit it hath gathered them.

034:017 And he hath cast the lot for them, and his hand hath divided
        it unto them by line: they shall possess it for ever, from
        generation to generation shall they dwell therein.

035:001 The wilderness and the solitary place shall be glad for them;
        and the desert shall rejoice, and blossom as the rose.

035:002 It shall blossom abundantly, and rejoice even with joy and
        singing: the glory of Lebanon shall be given unto it, the
        excellency of Carmel and Sharon, they shall see the glory of
        the LORD, and the excellency of our God.

035:003 Strengthen ye the weak hands, and confirm the feeble knees.

035:004 Say to them that are of a fearful heart, Be strong, fear not:
        behold, your God will come with vengeance, even God with a
        recompence; he will come and save you.

035:005 Then the eyes of the blind shall be opened, and the ears of
        the deaf shall be unstopped.

035:006 Then shall the lame man leap as an hart, and the tongue of the
        dumb sing: for in the wilderness shall waters break out, and
        streams in the desert.

035:007 And the parched ground shall become a pool, and the thirsty
        land springs of water: in the habitation of dragons, where
        each lay, shall be grass with reeds and rushes.

035:008 And an highway shall be there, and a way, and it shall be
        called The way of holiness; the unclean shall not pass over
        it; but it shall be for those: the wayfaring men, though
        fools, shall not err therein.

035:009 No lion shall be there, nor any ravenous beast shall go up
        thereon, it shall not be found there; but the redeemed shall
        walk there:

035:010 And the ransomed of the LORD shall return, and come to Zion
        with songs and everlasting joy upon their heads: they shall
        obtain joy and gladness, and sorrow and sighing shall flee
        away.

036:001 Now it came to pass in the fourteenth year of king Hezekiah,
        that Sennacherib king of Assyria came up against all the
        defenced cities of Judah, and took them.

036:002 And the king of Assyria sent Rabshakeh from Lachish to
        Jerusalem unto king Hezekiah with a great army. And he stood
        by the conduit of the upper pool in the highway of the
        fuller's field.

036:003 Then came forth unto him Eliakim, Hilkiah's son, which was
        over the house, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah, Asaph's son,
        the recorder.

036:004 And Rabshakeh said unto them, Say ye now to Hezekiah, Thus
        saith the great king, the king of Assyria, What confidence is
        this wherein thou trustest?

036:005 I say, sayest thou, (but they are but vain words) I have
        counsel and strength for war: now on whom dost thou trust,
        that thou rebellest against me?

036:006 Lo, thou trustest in the staff of this broken reed, on Egypt;
        whereon if a man lean, it will go into his hand, and pierce
        it: so is Pharaoh king of Egypt to all that trust in him.

036:007 But if thou say to me, We trust in the LORD our God: is it not
        he, whose high places and whose altars Hezekiah hath taken
        away, and said to Judah and to Jerusalem, Ye shall worship
        before this altar?

036:008 Now therefore give pledges, I pray thee, to my master the king
        of Assyria, and I will give thee two thousand horses, if thou
        be able on thy part to set riders upon them.

036:009 How then wilt thou turn away the face of one captain of the
        least of my master's servants, and put thy trust on Egypt for
        chariots and for horsemen?

036:010 And am I now come up without the LORD against this land to
        destroy it? the LORD said unto me, Go up against this land,
        and destroy it.

036:011 Then said Eliakim and Shebna and Joah unto Rabshakeh, Speak, I
        pray thee, unto thy servants in the Syrian language; for we
        understand it: and speak not to us in the Jews' language, in
        the ears of the people that are on the wall.

036:012 But Rabshakeh said, Hath my master sent me to thy master and
        to thee to speak these words? hath he not sent me to the men
        that sit upon the wall, that they may eat their own dung, and
        drink their own piss with you?

036:013 Then Rabshakeh stood, and cried with a loud voice in the Jews'
        language, and said, Hear ye the words of the great king, the
        king of Assyria.

036:014 Thus saith the king, Let not Hezekiah deceive you: for he
        shall not be able to deliver you.

036:015 Neither let Hezekiah make you trust in the LORD, saying, The
        LORD will surely deliver us: this city shall not be delivered
        into the hand of the king of Assyria.

036:016 Hearken not to Hezekiah: for thus saith the king of Assyria,
        Make an agreement with me by a present, and come out to me:
        and eat ye every one of his vine, and every one of his fig
        tree, and drink ye every one the waters of his own cistern;

036:017 Until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a
        land of corn and wine, a land of bread and vineyards.

036:018 Beware lest Hezekiah persuade you, saying, the LORD will
        deliver us. Hath any of the gods of the nations delivered his
        land out of the hand of the king of Assyria?

036:019 Where are the gods of Hamath and Arphad? where are the gods of
        Sepharvaim? and have they delivered Samaria out of my hand?

036:020 Who are they among all the gods of these lands, that have
        delivered their land out of my hand, that the LORD should
        deliver Jerusalem out of my hand?

036:021 But they held their peace, and answered him not a word: for
        the king's commandment was, saying, Answer him not.

036:022 Then came Eliakim, the son of Hilkiah, that was over the
        household, and Shebna the scribe, and Joah, the son of Asaph,
        the recorder, to Hezekiah with their clothes rent, and told
        him the words of Rabshakeh.

037:001 And it came to pass, when king Hezekiah heard it, that he rent
        his clothes, and covered himself with sackcloth, and went into
        the house of the LORD.

037:002 And he sent Eliakim, who was over the household, and Shebna
        the scribe, and the elders of the priests covered with
        sackcloth, unto Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz.

037:003 And they said unto him, Thus saith Hezekiah, This day is a day
        of trouble, and of rebuke, and of blasphemy: for the children
        are come to the birth, and there is not strength to bring
        forth.

037:004 It may be the LORD thy God will hear the words of Rabshakeh,
        whom the king of Assyria his master hath sent to reproach the
        living God, and will reprove the words which the LORD thy God
        hath heard: wherefore lift up thy prayer for the remnant that
        is left.

037:005 So the servants of king Hezekiah came to Isaiah.

037:006 And Isaiah said unto them, Thus shall ye say unto your master,
        Thus saith the LORD, Be not afraid of the words that thou hast
        heard, wherewith the servants of the king of Assyria have
        blasphemed me.

037:007 Behold, I will send a blast upon him, and he shall hear a
        rumour, and return to his own land; and I will cause him to
        fall by the sword in his own land.

037:008 So Rabshakeh returned, and found the king of Assyria warring
        against Libnah: for he had heard that he was departed from
        Lachish.

037:009 And he heard say concerning Tirhakah king of Ethiopia, He is
        come forth to make war with thee. And when he heard it, he
        sent messengers to Hezekiah, saying,

037:010 Thus shall ye speak to Hezekiah king of Judah, saying, Let not
        thy God, in whom thou trustest, deceive thee, saying,
        Jerusalem shall not be given into the hand of the king of
        Assyria.

037:011 Behold, thou hast heard what the kings of Assyria have done to
        all lands by destroying them utterly; and shalt thou be
        delivered?

037:012 Have the gods of the nations delivered them which my fathers
        have destroyed, as Gozan, and Haran, and Rezeph, and the
        children of Eden which were in Telassar?

037:013 Where is the king of Hamath, and the king of Arphad, and the
        king of the city of Sepharvaim, Hena, and Ivah?

037:014 And Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the
        messengers, and read it: and Hezekiah went up unto the house
        of the LORD, and spread it before the LORD.

037:015 And Hezekiah prayed unto the LORD, saying,

037:016 O LORD of hosts, God of Israel, that dwellest between the
        cherubims, thou art the God, even thou alone, of all the
        kingdoms of the earth: thou hast made heaven and earth.

037:017 Incline thine ear, O LORD, and hear; open thine eyes, O LORD,
        and see: and hear all the words of Sennacherib, which hath
        sent to reproach the living God.

037:018 Of a truth, LORD, the kings of Assyria have laid waste all the
        nations, and their countries,

037:019 And have cast their gods into the fire: for they were no gods,
        but the work of men's hands, wood and stone: therefore they
        have destroyed them.

037:020 Now therefore, O LORD our God, save us from his hand, that all
        the kingdoms of the earth may know that thou art the LORD,
        even thou only.

037:021 Then Isaiah the son of Amoz sent unto Hezekiah, saying, Thus
        saith the LORD God of Israel, Whereas thou hast prayed to me
        against Sennacherib king of Assyria:

037:022 This is the word which the LORD hath spoken concerning him;
        The virgin, the daughter of Zion, hath despised thee, and
        laughed thee to scorn; the daughter of Jerusalem hath shaken
        her head at thee.

037:023 Whom hast thou reproached and blasphemed? and against whom
        hast thou exalted thy voice, and lifted up thine eyes on high?
        even against the Holy One of Israel.

037:024 By thy servants hast thou reproached the Lord, and hast said,
        By the multitude of my chariots am I come up to the height of
        the mountains, to the sides of Lebanon; and I will cut down
        the tall cedars thereof, and the choice fir trees thereof: and
        I will enter into the height of his border, and the forest of
        his Carmel.

037:025 I have digged, and drunk water; and with the sole of my feet
        have I dried up all the rivers of the besieged places.

037:026 Hast thou not heard long ago, how I have done it; and of
        ancient times, that I have formed it? now have I brought it to
        pass, that thou shouldest be to lay waste defenced cities into
        ruinous heaps.

037:027 Therefore their inhabitants were of small power, they were
        dismayed and confounded: they were as the grass of the field,
        and as the green herb, as the grass on the housetops, and as
        corn blasted before it be grown up.

037:028 But I know thy abode, and thy going out, and thy coming in,
        and thy rage against me.

037:029 Because thy rage against me, and thy tumult, is come up into
        mine ears, therefore will I put my hook in thy nose, and my
        bridle in thy lips, and I will turn thee back by the way by
        which thou camest.

037:030 And this shall be a sign unto thee, Ye shall eat this year
        such as groweth of itself; and the second year that which
        springeth of the same: and in the third year sow ye, and reap,
        and plant vineyards, and eat the fruit thereof.

037:031 And the remnant that is escaped of the house of Judah shall
        again take root downward, and bear fruit upward:

037:032 For out of Jerusalem shall go forth a remnant, and they that
        escape out of mount Zion: the zeal of the LORD of hosts shall
        do this.

037:033 Therefore thus saith the LORD concerning the king of Assyria,
        He shall not come into this city, nor shoot an arrow there,
        nor come before it with shields, nor cast a bank against it.

037:034 By the way that he came, by the same shall he return, and
        shall not come into this city, saith the LORD.

037:035 For I will defend this city to save it for mine own sake, and
        for my servant David's sake.

037:036 Then the angel of the LORD went forth, and smote in the camp
        of the Assyrians a hundred and fourscore and five thousand:
        and when they arose early in the morning, behold, they were
        all dead corpses.

037:037 So Sennacherib king of Assyria departed, and went and
        returned, and dwelt at Nineveh.

037:038 And it came to pass, as he was worshipping in the house of
        Nisroch his god, that Adrammelech and Sharezer his sons smote
        him with the sword; and they escaped into the land of Armenia:
        and Esarhaddon his son reigned in his stead.

038:001 In those days was Hezekiah sick unto death. And Isaiah the
        prophet the son of Amoz came unto him, and said unto him, Thus
        saith the LORD, Set thine house in order: for thou shalt die,
        and not live.

038:002 Then Hezekiah turned his face toward the wall, and prayed unto
        the LORD,

038:003 And said, Remember now, O LORD, I beseech thee, how I have
        walked before thee in truth and with a perfect heart, and have
        done that which is good in thy sight. And Hezekiah wept sore.

038:004 Then came the word of the LORD to Isaiah, saying,

038:005 Go, and say to Hezekiah, Thus saith the LORD, the God of David
        thy father, I have heard thy prayer, I have seen thy tears:
        behold, I will add unto thy days fifteen years.

038:006 And I will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the
        king of Assyria: and I will defend this city.

038:007 And this shall be a sign unto thee from the LORD, that the
        LORD will do this thing that he hath spoken;

038:008 Behold, I will bring again the shadow of the degrees, which is
        gone down in the sun dial of Ahaz, ten degrees backward. So
        the sun returned ten degrees, by which degrees it was gone
        down.

038:009 The writing of Hezekiah king of Judah, when he had been sick,
        and was recovered of his sickness:

038:010 I said in the cutting off of my days, I shall go to the gates
        of the grave: I am deprived of the residue of my years.

038:011 I said, I shall not see the LORD, even the LORD, in the land
        of the living: I shall behold man no more with the inhabitants
        of the world.

038:012 Mine age is departed, and is removed from me as a shepherd's
        tent: I have cut off like a weaver my life: he will cut me off
        with pining sickness: from day even to night wilt thou make an
        end of me.

038:013 I reckoned till morning, that, as a lion, so will he break all
        my bones: from day even to night wilt thou make an end of me.

038:014 Like a crane or a swallow, so did I chatter: I did mourn as a
        dove: mine eyes fail with looking upward: O LORD, I am
        oppressed; undertake for me.

038:015 What shall I say? he hath both spoken unto me, and himself
        hath done it: I shall go softly all my years in the bitterness
        of my soul.

038:016 O LORD, by these things men live, and in all these things is
        the life of my spirit: so wilt thou recover me, and make me to
        live.

038:017 Behold, for peace I had great bitterness: but thou hast in
        love to my soul delivered it from the pit of corruption: for
        thou hast cast all my sins behind thy back.

038:018 For the grave cannot praise thee, death can not celebrate
        thee: they that go down into the pit cannot hope for thy
        truth.

038:019 The living, the living, he shall praise thee, as I do this
        day: the father to the children shall make known thy truth.

038:020 The LORD was ready to save me: therefore we will sing my songs
        to the stringed instruments all the days of our life in the
        house of the LORD.

038:021 For Isaiah had said, Let them take a lump of figs, and lay it
        for a plaister upon the boil, and he shall recover.

038:022 Hezekiah also had said, What is the sign that I shall go up to
        the house of the LORD?

039:001 At that time Merodachbaladan, the son of Baladan, king of
        Babylon, sent letters and a present to Hezekiah: for he had
        heard that he had been sick, and was recovered.

039:002 And Hezekiah was glad of them, and shewed them the house of
        his precious things, the silver, and the gold, and the spices,
        and the precious ointment, and all the house of his armour,
        and all that was found in his treasures: there was nothing in
        his house, nor in all his dominion, that Hezekiah shewed them
        not.

039:003 Then came Isaiah the prophet unto king Hezekiah, and said unto
        him, What said these men? and from whence came they unto thee?
        And Hezekiah said, They are come from a far country unto me,
        even from Babylon.

039:004 Then said he, What have they seen in thine house? And Hezekiah
        answered, All that is in mine house have they seen: there is
        nothing among my treasures that I have not shewed them.

039:005 Then said Isaiah to Hezekiah, Hear the word of the LORD of
        hosts:

039:006 Behold, the days come, that all that is in thine house, and
        that which thy fathers have laid up in store until this day,
        shall be carried to Babylon: nothing shall be left, saith the
        LORD.

039:007 And of thy sons that shall issue from thee, which thou shalt
        beget, shall they take away; and they shall be eunuchs in the
        palace of the king of Babylon.

039:008 Then said Hezekiah to Isaiah, Good is the word of the LORD
        which thou hast spoken. He said moreover, For there shall be
        peace and truth in my days.

040:001 Comfort ye, comfort ye my people, saith your God.

040:002 Speak ye comfortably to Jerusalem, and cry unto her, that her
        warfare is accomplished, that her iniquity is pardoned: for
        she hath received of the LORD's hand double for all her sins.

040:003 The voice of him that crieth in the wilderness, Prepare ye the
        way of the LORD, make straight in the desert a highway for our
        God.

040:004 Every valley shall be exalted, and every mountain and hill
        shall be made low: and the crooked shall be made straight, and
        the rough places plain:

040:005 And the glory of the LORD shall be revealed, and all flesh
        shall see it together: for the mouth of the LORD hath spoken
        it.

040:006 The voice said, Cry. And he said, What shall I cry? All flesh
        is grass, and all the goodliness thereof is as the flower of
        the field:

040:007 The grass withereth, the flower fadeth: because the spirit of
        the LORD bloweth upon it: surely the people is grass.

040:008 The grass withereth, the flower fadeth: but the word of our
        God shall stand for ever.

040:009 O Zion, that bringest good tidings, get thee up into the high
        mountain; O Jerusalem, that bringest good tidings, lift up thy
        voice with strength; lift it up, be not afraid; say unto the
        cities of Judah, Behold your God!

040:010 Behold, the Lord GOD will come with strong hand, and his arm
        shall rule for him: behold, his reward is with him, and his
        work before him.

040:011 He shall feed his flock like a shepherd: he shall gather the
        lambs with his arm, and carry them in his bosom, and shall
        gently lead those that are with young.

040:012 Who hath measured the waters in the hollow of his hand, and
        meted out heaven with the span, and comprehended the dust of
        the earth in a measure, and weighed the mountains in scales,
        and the hills in a balance?

040:013 Who hath directed the Spirit of the LORD, or being his
        counsellor hath taught him?

040:014 With whom took he counsel, and who instructed him, and taught
        him in the path of judgment, and taught him knowledge, and
        shewed to him the way of understanding?

040:015 Behold, the nations are as a drop of a bucket, and are counted
        as the small dust of the balance: behold, he taketh up the
        isles as a very little thing.

040:016 And Lebanon is not sufficient to burn, nor the beasts thereof
        sufficient for a burnt offering.

040:017 All nations before him are as nothing; and they are counted to
        him less than nothing, and vanity.

040:018 To whom then will ye liken God? or what likeness will ye
        compare unto him?

040:019 The workman melteth a graven image, and the goldsmith
        spreadeth it over with gold, and casteth silver chains.

040:020 He that is so impoverished that he hath no oblation chooseth a
        tree that will not rot; he seeketh unto him a cunning workman
        to prepare a graven image, that shall not be moved.

040:021 Have ye not known? have ye not heard? hath it not been told
        you from the beginning? have ye not understood from the
        foundations of the earth?

040:022 It is he that sitteth upon the circle of the earth, and the
        inhabitants thereof are as grasshoppers; that stretcheth out
        the heavens as a curtain, and spreadeth them out as a tent to
        dwell in:

040:023 That bringeth the princes to nothing; he maketh the judges of
        the earth as vanity.

040:024 Yea, they shall not be planted; yea, they shall not be sown:
        yea, their stock shall not take root in the earth: and he
        shall also blow upon them, and they shall wither, and the
        whirlwind shall take them away as stubble.

040:025 To whom then will ye liken me, or shall I be equal? saith the
        Holy One.

040:026 Lift up your eyes on high, and behold who hath created these
        things, that bringeth out their host by number: he calleth
        them all by names by the greatness of his might, for that he
        is strong in power; not one faileth.

040:027 Why sayest thou, O Jacob, and speakest, O Israel, My way is
        hid from the LORD, and my judgment is passed over from my God?

040:028 Hast thou not known? hast thou not heard, that the everlasting
        God, the LORD, the Creator of the ends of the earth, fainteth
        not, neither is weary? there is no searching of his
        understanding.

040:029 He giveth power to the faint; and to them that have no might
        he increaseth strength.

040:030 Even the youths shall faint and be weary, and the young men
        shall utterly fall:

040:031 But they that wait upon the LORD shall renew their strength;
        they shall mount up with wings as eagles; they shall run, and
        not be weary; and they shall walk, and not faint.

041:001 Keep silence before me, O islands; and let the people renew
        their strength: let them come near; then let them speak: let
        us come near together to judgment.

041:002 Who raised up the righteous man from the east, called him to
        his foot, gave the nations before him, and made him rule over
        kings? he gave them as the dust to his sword, and as driven
        stubble to his bow.

041:003 He pursued them, and passed safely; even by the way that he
        had not gone with his feet.

041:004 Who hath wrought and done it, calling the generations from the
        beginning? I the LORD, the first, and with the last; I am he.

041:005 The isles saw it, and feared; the ends of the earth were
        afraid, drew near, and came.

041:006 They helped every one his neighbour; and every one said to his
        brother, Be of good courage.

041:007 So the carpenter encouraged the goldsmith, and he that
        smootheth with the hammer him that smote the anvil, saying, It
        is ready for the sodering: and he fastened it with nails, that
        it should not be moved.

041:008 But thou, Israel, art my servant, Jacob whom I have chosen,
        the seed of Abraham my friend.

041:009 Thou whom I have taken from the ends of the earth, and called
        thee from the chief men thereof, and said unto thee, Thou art
        my servant; I have chosen thee, and not cast thee away.

041:010 Fear thou not; for I am with thee: be not dismayed; for I am
        thy God: I will strengthen thee; yea, I will help thee; yea, I
        will uphold thee with the right hand of my righteousness.

041:011 Behold, all they that were incensed against thee shall be
        ashamed and confounded: they shall be as nothing; and they
        that strive with thee shall perish.

041:012 Thou shalt seek them, and shalt not find them, even them that
        contended with thee: they that war against thee shall be as
        nothing, and as a thing of nought.

041:013 For I the LORD thy God will hold thy right hand, saying unto
        thee, Fear not; I will help thee.

041:014 Fear not, thou worm Jacob, and ye men of Israel; I will help
        thee, saith the LORD, and thy redeemer, the Holy One of
        Israel.

041:015 Behold, I will make thee a new sharp threshing instrument
        having teeth: thou shalt thresh the mountains, and beat them
        small, and shalt make the hills as chaff.

041:016 Thou shalt fan them, and the wind shall carry them away, and
        the whirlwind shall scatter them: and thou shalt rejoice in
        the LORD, and shalt glory in the Holy One of Israel.

041:017 When the poor and needy seek water, and there is none, and
        their tongue faileth for thirst, I the LORD will hear them, I
        the God of Israel will not forsake them.

041:018 I will open rivers in high places, and fountains in the midst
        of the valleys: I will make the wilderness a pool of water,
        and the dry land springs of water.

041:019 I will plant in the wilderness the cedar, the shittah tree,
        and the myrtle, and the oil tree; I will set in the desert the
        fir tree, and the pine, and the box tree together:

041:020 That they may see, and know, and consider, and understand
        together, that the hand of the LORD hath done this, and the
        Holy One of Israel hath created it.

041:021 Produce your cause, saith the LORD; bring forth your strong
        reasons, saith the King of Jacob.

041:022 Let them bring them forth, and shew us what shall happen: let
        them shew the former things, what they be, that we may
        consider them, and know the latter end of them; or declare us
        things for to come.

041:023 Shew the things that are to come hereafter, that we may know
        that ye are gods: yea, do good, or do evil, that we may be
        dismayed, and behold it together.

041:024 Behold, ye are of nothing, and your work of nought: an
        abomination is he that chooseth you.

041:025 I have raised up one from the north, and he shall come: from
        the rising of the sun shall he call upon my name: and he shall
        come upon princes as upon morter, and as the potter treadeth
        clay.

041:026 Who hath declared from the beginning, that we may know? and
        beforetime, that we may say, He is righteous? yea, there is
        none that sheweth, yea, there is none that declareth, yea,
        there is none that heareth your words.

041:027 The first shall say to Zion, Behold, behold them: and I will
        give to Jerusalem one that bringeth good tidings.

041:028 For I beheld, and there was no man; even among them, and there
        was no counsellor, that, when I asked of them, could answer a
        word.

041:029 Behold, they are all vanity; their works are nothing: their
        molten images are wind and confusion.

042:001 Behold my servant, whom I uphold; mine elect, in whom my soul
        delighteth; I have put my spirit upon him: he shall bring
        forth judgment to the Gentiles.

042:002 He shall not cry, nor lift up, nor cause his voice to be heard
        in the street.

042:003 A bruised reed shall he not break, and the smoking flax shall
        he not quench: he shall bring forth judgment unto truth.

042:004 He shall not fail nor be discouraged, till he have set
        judgment in the earth: and the isles shall wait for his law.

042:005 Thus saith God the LORD, he that created the heavens, and
        stretched them out; he that spread forth the earth, and that
        which cometh out of it; he that giveth breath unto the people
        upon it, and spirit to them that walk therein:

042:006 I the LORD have called thee in righteousness, and will hold
        thine hand, and will keep thee, and give thee for a covenant
        of the people, for a light of the Gentiles;

042:007 To open the blind eyes, to bring out the prisoners from the
        prison, and them that sit in darkness out of the prison house.

042:008 I am the LORD: that is my name: and my glory will I not give
        to another, neither my praise to graven images.

042:009 Behold, the former things are come to pass, and new things do
        I declare: before they spring forth I tell you of them.

042:010 Sing unto the LORD a new song, and his praise from the end of
        the earth, ye that go down to the sea, and all that is
        therein; the isles, and the inhabitants thereof.

042:011 Let the wilderness and the cities thereof lift up their voice,
        the villages that Kedar doth inhabit: let the inhabitants of
        the rock sing, let them shout from the top of the mountains.

042:012 Let them give glory unto the LORD, and declare his praise in
        the islands.

042:013 The LORD shall go forth as a mighty man, he shall stir up
        jealousy like a man of war: he shall cry, yea, roar; he shall
        prevail against his enemies.

042:014 I have long time holden my peace; I have been still, and
        refrained myself: now will I cry like a travailing woman; I
        will destroy and devour at once.

042:015 I will make waste mountains and hills, and dry up all their
        herbs; and I will make the rivers islands, and I will dry up
        the pools.

042:016 And I will bring the blind by a way that they knew not; I will
        lead them in paths that they have not known: I will make
        darkness light before them, and crooked things straight. These
        things will I do unto them, and not forsake them.

042:017 They shall be turned back, they shall be greatly ashamed, that
        trust in graven images, that say to the molten images, Ye are
        our gods.

042:018 Hear, ye deaf; and look, ye blind, that ye may see.

042:019 Who is blind, but my servant? or deaf, as my messenger that I
        sent? who is blind as he that is perfect, and blind as the
        LORD's servant?

042:020 Seeing many things, but thou observest not; opening the ears,
        but he heareth not.

042:021 The LORD is well pleased for his righteousness' sake; he will
        magnify the law, and make it honourable.

042:022 But this is a people robbed and spoiled; they are all of them
        snared in holes, and they are hid in prison houses: they are
        for a prey, and none delivereth; for a spoil, and none saith,
        Restore.

042:023 Who among you will give ear to this? who will hearken and hear
        for the time to come?

042:024 Who gave Jacob for a spoil, and Israel to the robbers? did not
        the LORD, he against whom we have sinned? for they would not
        walk in his ways, neither were they obedient unto his law.

042:025 Therefore he hath poured upon him the fury of his anger, and
        the strength of battle: and it hath set him on fire round
        about, yet he knew not; and it burned him, yet he laid it not
        to heart.

043:001 But now thus saith the LORD that created thee, O Jacob, and he
        that formed thee, O Israel, Fear not: for I have redeemed
        thee, I have called thee by thy name; thou art mine.

043:002 When thou passest through the waters, I will be with thee; and
        through the rivers, they shall not overflow thee: when thou
        walkest through the fire, thou shalt not be burned; neither
        shall the flame kindle upon thee.

043:003 For I am the LORD thy God, the Holy One of Israel, thy
        Saviour: I gave Egypt for thy ransom, Ethiopia and Seba for
        thee.

043:004 Since thou wast precious in my sight, thou hast been
        honourable, and I have loved thee: therefore will I give men
        for thee, and people for thy life.

043:005 Fear not: for I am with thee: I will bring thy seed from the
        east, and gather thee from the west;

043:006 I will say to the north, Give up; and to the south, Keep not
        back: bring my sons from far, and my daughters from the ends
        of the earth;

043:007 Even every one that is called by my name: for I have created
        him for my glory, I have formed him; yea, I have made him.

043:008 Bring forth the blind people that have eyes, and the deaf that
        have ears.

043:009 Let all the nations be gathered together, and let the people
        be assembled: who among them can declare this, and shew us
        former things? let them bring forth their witnesses, that they
        may be justified: or let them hear, and say, It is truth.

043:010 Ye are my witnesses, saith the LORD, and my servant whom I
        have chosen: that ye may know and believe me, and understand
        that I am he: before me there was no God formed, neither shall
        there be after me.

043:011 I, even I, am the LORD; and beside me there is no saviour.

043:012 I have declared, and have saved, and I have shewed, when there
        was no strange god among you: therefore ye are my witnesses,
        saith the LORD, that I am God.

043:013 Yea, before the day was I am he; and there is none that can
        deliver out of my hand: I will work, and who shall let it?

043:014 Thus saith the LORD, your redeemer, the Holy One of Israel;
        For your sake I have sent to Babylon, and have brought down
        all their nobles, and the Chaldeans, whose cry is in the
        ships.

043:015 I am the LORD, your Holy One, the creator of Israel, your
        King.

043:016 Thus saith the LORD, which maketh a way in the sea, and a path
        in the mighty waters;

043:017 Which bringeth forth the chariot and horse, the army and the
        power; they shall lie down together, they shall not rise: they
        are extinct, they are quenched as tow.

043:018 Remember ye not the former things, neither consider the things
        of old.

043:019 Behold, I will do a new thing; now it shall spring forth;
        shall ye not know it? I will even make a way in the
        wilderness, and rivers in the desert.

043:020 The beast of the field shall honour me, the dragons and the
        owls: because I give waters in the wilderness, and rivers in
        the desert, to give drink to my people, my chosen.

043:021 This people have I formed for myself; they shall shew forth my
        praise.

043:022 But thou hast not called upon me, O Jacob; but thou hast been
        weary of me, O Israel.

043:023 Thou hast not brought me the small cattle of thy burnt
        offerings; neither hast thou honoured me with thy sacrifices.
        I have not caused thee to serve with an offering, nor wearied
        thee with incense.

043:024 Thou hast bought me no sweet cane with money, neither hast
        thou filled me with the fat of thy sacrifices: but thou hast
        made me to serve with thy sins, thou hast wearied me with
        thine iniquities.

043:025 I, even I, am he that blotteth out thy transgressions for mine
        own sake, and will not remember thy sins.

043:026 Put me in remembrance: let us plead together: declare thou,
        that thou mayest be justified.

043:027 Thy first father hath sinned, and thy teachers have
        transgressed against me.

043:028 Therefore I have profaned the princes of the sanctuary, and
        have given Jacob to the curse, and Israel to reproaches.

044:001 Yet now hear, O Jacob my servant; and Israel, whom I have
        chosen:

044:002 Thus saith the LORD that made thee, and formed thee from the
        womb, which will help thee; Fear not, O Jacob, my servant; and
        thou, Jesurun, whom I have chosen.

044:003 For I will pour water upon him that is thirsty, and floods
        upon the dry ground: I will pour my spirit upon thy seed, and
        my blessing upon thine offspring:

044:004 And they shall spring up as among the grass, as willows by the
        water courses.

044:005 One shall say, I am the LORD's; and another shall call himself
        by the name of Jacob; and another shall subscribe with his
        hand unto the LORD, and surname himself by the name of Israel.

044:006 Thus saith the LORD the King of Israel, and his redeemer the
        LORD of hosts; I am the first, and I am the last; and beside
        me there is no God.

044:007 And who, as I, shall call, and shall declare it, and set it in
        order for me, since I appointed the ancient people? and the
        things that are coming, and shall come, let them shew unto
        them.

044:008 Fear ye not, neither be afraid: have not I told thee from that
        time, and have declared it? ye are even my witnesses. Is there
        a God beside me? yea, there is no God; I know not any.

044:009 They that make a graven image are all of them vanity; and
        their delectable things shall not profit; and they are their
        own witnesses; they see not, nor know; that they may be
        ashamed.

044:010 Who hath formed a god, or molten a graven image that is
        profitable for nothing?

044:011 Behold, all his fellows shall be ashamed: and the workmen,
        they are of men: let them all be gathered together, let them
        stand up; yet they shall fear, and they shall be ashamed
        together.

044:012 The smith with the tongs both worketh in the coals, and
        fashioneth it with hammers, and worketh it with the strength
        of his arms: yea, he is hungry, and his strength faileth: he
        drinketh no water, and is faint.

044:013 The carpenter stretcheth out his rule; he marketh it out with
        a line; he fitteth it with planes, and he marketh it out with
        the compass, and maketh it after the figure of a man,
        according to the beauty of a man; that it may remain in the
        house.

044:014 He heweth him down cedars, and taketh the cypress and the oak,
        which he strengtheneth for himself among the trees of the
        forest: he planteth an ash, and the rain doth nourish it.

044:015 Then shall it be for a man to burn: for he will take thereof,
        and warm himself; yea, he kindleth it, and baketh bread; yea,
        he maketh a god, and worshippeth it; he maketh it a graven
        image, and falleth down thereto.

044:016 He burneth part thereof in the fire; with part thereof he
        eateth flesh; he roasteth roast, and is satisfied: yea, he
        warmeth himself, and saith, Aha, I am warm, I have seen the
        fire:

044:017 And the residue thereof he maketh a god, even his graven
        image: he falleth down unto it, and worshippeth it, and
        prayeth unto it, and saith, Deliver me; for thou art my god.

044:018 They have not known nor understood: for he hath shut their
        eyes, that they cannot see; and their hearts, that they cannot
        understand.

044:019 And none considereth in his heart, neither is there knowledge
        nor understanding to say, I have burned part of it in the
        fire; yea, also I have baked bread upon the coals thereof; I
        have roasted flesh, and eaten it: and shall I make the residue
        thereof an abomination? shall I fall down to the stock of a
        tree?

044:020 He feedeth on ashes: a deceived heart hath turned him aside,
        that he cannot deliver his soul, nor say, Is there not a lie
        in my right hand?

044:021 Remember these, O Jacob and Israel; for thou art my servant: I
        have formed thee; thou art my servant: O Israel, thou shalt
        not be forgotten of me.

044:022 I have blotted out, as a thick cloud, thy transgressions, and,
        as a cloud, thy sins: return unto me; for I have redeemed
        thee.

044:023 Sing, O ye heavens; for the LORD hath done it: shout, ye lower
        parts of the earth: break forth into singing, ye mountains, O
        forest, and every tree therein: for the LORD hath redeemed
        Jacob, and glorified himself in Israel.

044:024 Thus saith the LORD, thy redeemer, and he that formed thee
        from the womb, I am the LORD that maketh all things; that
        stretcheth forth the heavens alone; that spreadeth abroad the
        earth by myself;

044:025 That frustrateth the tokens of the liars, and maketh diviners
        mad; that turneth wise men backward, and maketh their
        knowledge foolish;

044:026 That confirmeth the word of his servant, and performeth the
        counsel of his messengers; that saith to Jerusalem, Thou shalt
        be inhabited; and to the cities of Judah, Ye shall be built,
        and I will raise up the decayed places thereof:

044:027 That saith to the deep, Be dry, and I will dry up thy rivers:

044:028 That saith of Cyrus, He is my shepherd, and shall perform all
        my pleasure: even saying to Jerusalem, Thou shalt be built;
        and to the temple, Thy foundation shall be laid.

045:001 Thus saith the LORD to his anointed, to Cyrus, whose right
        hand I have holden, to subdue nations before him; and I will
        loose the loins of kings, to open before him the two leaved
        gates; and the gates shall not be shut;

045:002 I will go before thee, and make the crooked places straight: I
        will break in pieces the gates of brass, and cut in sunder the
        bars of iron:

045:003 And I will give thee the treasures of darkness, and hidden
        riches of secret places, that thou mayest know that I, the
        LORD, which call thee by thy name, am the God of Israel.

045:004 For Jacob my servant's sake, and Israel mine elect, I have
        even called thee by thy name: I have surnamed thee, though
        thou hast not known me.

045:005 I am the LORD, and there is none else, there is no God beside
        me: I girded thee, though thou hast not known me:

045:006 That they may know from the rising of the sun, and from the
        west, that there is none beside me. I am the LORD, and there
        is none else.

045:007 I form the light, and create darkness: I make peace, and
        create evil: I the LORD do all these things.

045:008 Drop down, ye heavens, from above, and let the skies pour down
        righteousness: let the earth open, and let them bring forth
        salvation, and let righteousness spring up together; I the
        LORD have created it.

045:009 Woe unto him that striveth with his Maker! Let the potsherd
        strive with the potsherds of the earth. Shall the clay say to
        him that fashioneth it, What makest thou? or thy work, He hath
        no hands?

045:010 Woe unto him that saith unto his father, What begettest thou?
        or to the woman, What hast thou brought forth?

045:011 Thus saith the LORD, the Holy One of Israel, and his Maker,
        Ask me of things to come concerning my sons, and concerning
        the work of my hands command ye me.

045:012 I have made the earth, and created man upon it: I, even my
        hands, have stretched out the heavens, and all their host have
        I commanded.

045:013 I have raised him up in righteousness, and I will direct all
        his ways: he shall build my city, and he shall let go my
        captives, not for price nor reward, saith the LORD of hosts.

045:014 Thus saith the LORD, The labour of Egypt, and merchandise of
        Ethiopia and of the Sabeans, men of stature, shall come over
        unto thee, and they shall be thine: they shall come after
        thee; in chains they shall come over, and they shall fall down
        unto thee, they shall make supplication unto thee, saying,
        Surely God is in thee; and there is none else, there is no
        God.

045:015 Verily thou art a God that hidest thyself, O God of Israel,
        the Saviour.

045:016 They shall be ashamed, and also confounded, all of them: they
        shall go to confusion together that are makers of idols.

045:017 But Israel shall be saved in the LORD with an everlasting
        salvation: ye shall not be ashamed nor confounded world
        without end.

045:018 For thus saith the LORD that created the heavens; God himself
        that formed the earth and made it; he hath established it, he
        created it not in vain, he formed it to be inhabited: I am the
        LORD; and there is none else.

045:019 I have not spoken in secret, in a dark place of the earth: I
        said not unto the seed of Jacob, Seek ye me in vain: I the
        LORD speak righteousness, I declare things that are right.

045:020 Assemble yourselves and come; draw near together, ye that are
        escaped of the nations: they have no knowledge that set up the
        wood of their graven image, and pray unto a god that cannot
        save.

045:021 Tell ye, and bring them near; yea, let them take counsel
        together: who hath declared this from ancient time? who hath
        told it from that time? have not I the LORD? and there is no
        God else beside me; a just God and a Saviour; there is none
        beside me.

045:022 Look unto me, and be ye saved, all the ends of the earth: for
        I am God, and there is none else.

045:023 I have sworn by myself, the word is gone out of my mouth in
        righteousness, and shall not return, That unto me every knee
        shall bow, every tongue shall swear.

045:024 Surely, shall one say, in the LORD have I righteousness and
        strength: even to him shall men come; and all that are
        incensed against him shall be ashamed.

045:025 In the LORD shall all the seed of Israel be justified, and
        shall glory.

046:001 Bel boweth down, Nebo stoopeth, their idols were upon the
        beasts, and upon the cattle: your carriages were heavy loaden;
        they are a burden to the weary beast.

046:002 They stoop, they bow down together; they could not deliver the
        burden, but themselves are gone into captivity.

046:003 Hearken unto me, O house of Jacob, and all the remnant of the
        house of Israel, which are borne by me from the belly, which
        are carried from the womb:

046:004 And even to your old age I am he; and even to hoar hairs will
        I carry you: I have made, and I will bear; even I will carry,
        and will deliver you.

046:005 To whom will ye liken me, and make me equal, and compare me,
        that we may be like?

046:006 They lavish gold out of the bag, and weigh silver in the
        balance, and hire a goldsmith; and he maketh it a god: they
        fall down, yea, they worship.

046:007 They bear him upon the shoulder, they carry him, and set him
        in his place, and he standeth; from his place shall he not
        remove: yea, one shall cry unto him, yet can he not answer,
        nor save him out of his trouble.

046:008 Remember this, and shew yourselves men: bring it again to
        mind, O ye transgressors.

046:009 Remember the former things of old: for I am God, and there is
        none else; I am God, and there is none like me,

046:010 Declaring the end from the beginning, and from ancient times
        the things that are not yet done, saying, My counsel shall
        stand, and I will do all my pleasure:

046:011 Calling a ravenous bird from the east, the man that executeth
        my counsel from a far country: yea, I have spoken it, I will
        also bring it to pass; I have purposed it, I will also do it.

046:012 Hearken unto me, ye stouthearted, that are far from
        righteousness:

046:013 I bring near my righteousness; it shall not be far off, and my
        salvation shall not tarry: and I will place salvation in Zion
        for Israel my glory.

047:001 Come down, and sit in the dust, O virgin daughter of Babylon,
        sit on the ground: there is no throne, O daughter of the
        Chaldeans: for thou shalt no more be called tender and
        delicate.

047:002 Take the millstones, and grind meal: uncover thy locks, make
        bare the leg, uncover the thigh, pass over the rivers.

047:003 Thy nakedness shall be uncovered, yea, thy shame shall be
        seen: I will take vengeance, and I will not meet thee as a
        man.

047:004 As for our redeemer, the LORD of hosts is his name, the Holy
        One of Israel.

047:005 Sit thou silent, and get thee into darkness, O daughter of the
        Chaldeans: for thou shalt no more be called, The lady of
        kingdoms.

047:006 I was wroth with my people, I have polluted mine inheritance,
        and given them into thine hand: thou didst shew them no mercy;
        upon the ancient hast thou very heavily laid thy yoke.

047:007 And thou saidst, I shall be a lady for ever: so that thou
        didst not lay these things to thy heart, neither didst
        remember the latter end of it.

047:008 Therefore hear now this, thou that art given to pleasures,
        that dwellest carelessly, that sayest in thine heart, I am,
        and none else beside me; I shall not sit as a widow, neither
        shall I know the loss of children:

047:009 But these two things shall come to thee in a moment in one
        day, the loss of children, and widowhood: they shall come upon
        thee in their perfection for the multitude of thy sorceries,
        and for the great abundance of thine enchantments.

047:010 For thou hast trusted in thy wickedness: thou hast said, None
        seeth me. Thy wisdom and thy knowledge, it hath perverted
        thee; and thou hast said in thine heart, I am, and none else
        beside me.

047:011 Therefore shall evil come upon thee; thou shalt not know from
        whence it riseth: and mischief shall fall upon thee; thou
        shalt not be able to put it off: and desolation shall come
        upon thee suddenly, which thou shalt not know.

047:012 Stand now with thine enchantments, and with the multitude of
        thy sorceries, wherein thou hast laboured from thy youth; if
        so be thou shalt be able to profit, if so be thou mayest
        prevail.

047:013 Thou art wearied in the multitude of thy counsels. Let now the
        astrologers, the stargazers, the monthly prognosticators,
        stand up, and save thee from these things that shall come upon
        thee.

047:014 Behold, they shall be as stubble; the fire shall burn them;
        they shall not deliver themselves from the power of the flame:
        there shall not be a coal to warm at, nor fire to sit before
        it.

047:015 Thus shall they be unto thee with whom thou hast laboured,
        even thy merchants, from thy youth: they shall wander every
        one to his quarter; none shall save thee.

048:001 Hear ye this, O house of Jacob, which are called by the name
        of Israel, and are come forth out of the waters of Judah,
        which swear by the name of the LORD, and make mention of the
        God of Israel, but not in truth, nor in righteousness.

048:002 For they call themselves of the holy city, and stay themselves
        upon the God of Israel; The LORD of hosts is his name.

048:003 I have declared the former things from the beginning; and they
        went forth out of my mouth, and I shewed them; I did them
        suddenly, and they came to pass.

048:004 Because I knew that thou art obstinate, and thy neck is an
        iron sinew, and thy brow brass;

048:005 I have even from the beginning declared it to thee; before it
        came to pass I shewed it thee: lest thou shouldest say, Mine
        idol hath done them, and my graven image, and my molten image,
        hath commanded them.

048:006 Thou hast heard, see all this; and will not ye declare it? I
        have shewed thee new things from this time, even hidden
        things, and thou didst not know them.

048:007 They are created now, and not from the beginning; even before
        the day when thou heardest them not; lest thou shouldest say,
        Behold, I knew them.

048:008 Yea, thou heardest not; yea, thou knewest not; yea, from that
        time that thine ear was not opened: for I knew that thou
        wouldest deal very treacherously, and wast called a
        transgressor from the womb.

048:009 For my name's sake will I defer mine anger, and for my praise
        will I refrain for thee, that I cut thee not off.

048:010 Behold, I have refined thee, but not with silver; I have
        chosen thee in the furnace of affliction.

048:011 For mine own sake, even for mine own sake, will I do it: for
        how should my name be polluted? and I will not give my glory
        unto another.

048:012 Hearken unto me, O Jacob and Israel, my called; I am he; I am
        the first, I also am the last.

048:013 Mine hand also hath laid the foundation of the earth, and my
        right hand hath spanned the heavens: when I call unto them,
        they stand up together.

048:014 All ye, assemble yourselves, and hear; which among them hath
        declared these things? The LORD hath loved him: he will do his
        pleasure on Babylon, and his arm shall be on the Chaldeans.

048:015 I, even I, have spoken; yea, I have called him: I have brought
        him, and he shall make his way prosperous.

048:016 Come ye near unto me, hear ye this; I have not spoken in
        secret from the beginning; from the time that it was, there am
        I: and now the Lord GOD, and his Spirit, hath sent me.

048:017 Thus saith the LORD, thy Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel; I
        am the LORD thy God which teacheth thee to profit, which
        leadeth thee by the way that thou shouldest go.

048:018 O that thou hadst hearkened to my commandments! then had thy
        peace been as a river, and thy righteousness as the waves of
        the sea:

048:019 Thy seed also had been as the sand, and the offspring of thy
        bowels like the gravel thereof; his name should not have been
        cut off nor destroyed from before me.

048:020 Go ye forth of Babylon, flee ye from the Chaldeans, with a
        voice of singing declare ye, tell this, utter it even to the
        end of the earth; say ye, The LORD hath redeemed his servant
        Jacob.

048:021 And they thirsted not when he led them through the deserts: he
        caused the waters to flow out of the rock for them: he clave
        the rock also, and the waters gushed out.

048:022 There is no peace, saith the LORD, unto the wicked.

049:001 Listen, O isles, unto me; and hearken, ye people, from far;
        The LORD hath called me from the womb; from the bowels of my
        mother hath he made mention of my name.

049:002 And he hath made my mouth like a sharp sword; in the shadow of
        his hand hath he hid me, and made me a polished shaft; in his
        quiver hath he hid me;

049:003 And said unto me, Thou art my servant, O Israel, in whom I
        will be glorified.

049:004 Then I said, I have laboured in vain, I have spent my strength
        for nought, and in vain: yet surely my judgment is with the
        LORD, and my work with my God.

049:005 And now, saith the LORD that formed me from the womb to be his
        servant, to bring Jacob again to him, Though Israel be not
        gathered, yet shall I be glorious in the eyes of the LORD, and
        my God shall be my strength.

049:006 And he said, It is a light thing that thou shouldest be my
        servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob, and to restore the
        preserved of Israel: I will also give thee for a light to the
        Gentiles, that thou mayest be my salvation unto the end of the
        earth.

049:007 Thus saith the LORD, the Redeemer of Israel, and his Holy One,
        to him whom man despiseth, to him whom the nation abhorreth,
        to a servant of rulers, Kings shall see and arise, princes
        also shall worship, because of the LORD that is faithful, and
        the Holy One of Israel, and he shall choose thee.

049:008 Thus saith the LORD, In an acceptable time have I heard thee,
        and in a day of salvation have I helped thee: and I will
        preserve thee, and give thee for a covenant of the people, to
        establish the earth, to cause to inherit the desolate
        heritages;

049:009 That thou mayest say to the prisoners, Go forth; to them that
        are in darkness, Shew yourselves. They shall feed in the ways,
        and their pastures shall be in all high places.

049:010 They shall not hunger nor thirst; neither shall the heat nor
        sun smite them: for he that hath mercy on them shall lead
        them, even by the springs of water shall he guide them.

049:011 And I will make all my mountains a way, and my highways shall
        be exalted.

049:012 Behold, these shall come from far: and, lo, these from the
        north and from the west; and these from the land of Sinim.

049:013 Sing, O heavens; and be joyful, O earth; and break forth into
        singing, O mountains: for the LORD hath comforted his people,
        and will have mercy upon his afflicted.

049:014 But Zion said, The LORD hath forsaken me, and my Lord hath
        forgotten me.

049:015 Can a woman forget her sucking child, that she should not have
        compassion on the son of her womb? yea, they may forget, yet
        will I not forget thee.

049:016 Behold, I have graven thee upon the palms of my hands; thy
        walls are continually before me.

049:017 Thy children shall make haste; thy destroyers and they that
        made thee waste shall go forth of thee.

049:018 Lift up thine eyes round about, and behold: all these gather
        themselves together, and come to thee. As I live, saith the
        LORD, thou shalt surely clothe thee with them all, as with an
        ornament, and bind them on thee, as a bride doeth.

049:019 For thy waste and thy desolate places, and the land of thy
        destruction, shall even now be too narrow by reason of the
        inhabitants, and they that swallowed thee up shall be far
        away.

049:020 The children which thou shalt have, after thou hast lost the
        other, shall say again in thine ears, The place is too strait
        for me: give place to me that I may dwell.

049:021 Then shalt thou say in thine heart, Who hath begotten me
        these, seeing I have lost my children, and am desolate, a
        captive, and removing to and fro? and who hath brought up
        these? Behold, I was left alone; these, where had they been?

049:022 Thus saith the Lord GOD, Behold, I will lift up mine hand to
        the Gentiles, and set up my standard to the people: and they
        shall bring thy sons in their arms, and thy daughters shall be
        carried upon their shoulders.

049:023 And kings shall be thy nursing fathers, and their queens thy
        nursing mothers: they shall bow down to thee with their face
        toward the earth, and lick up the dust of thy feet; and thou
        shalt know that I am the LORD: for they shall not be ashamed
        that wait for me.

049:024 Shall the prey be taken from the mighty, or the lawful captive
        delivered?

049:025 But thus saith the LORD, Even the captives of the mighty shall
        be taken away, and the prey of the terrible shall be
        delivered: for I will contend with him that contendeth with
        thee, and I will save thy children.

049:026 And I will feed them that oppress thee with their own flesh;
        and they shall be drunken with their own blood, as with sweet
        wine: and all flesh shall know that I the LORD am thy Saviour
        and thy Redeemer, the mighty One of Jacob.

050:001 Thus saith the LORD, Where is the bill of your mother's
        divorcement, whom I have put away? or which of my creditors is
        it to whom I have sold you? Behold, for your iniquities have
        ye sold yourselves, and for your transgressions is your mother
        put away.

050:002 Wherefore, when I came, was there no man? when I called, was
        there none to answer? Is my hand shortened at all, that it
        cannot redeem? or have I no power to deliver? behold, at my
        rebuke I dry up the sea, I make the rivers a wilderness: their
        fish stinketh, because there is no water, and dieth for
        thirst.

050:003 I clothe the heavens with blackness, and I make sackcloth
        their covering.

050:004 The Lord GOD hath given me the tongue of the learned, that I
        should know how to speak a word in season to him that is
        weary: he wakeneth morning by morning, he wakeneth mine ear to
        hear as the learned.

050:005 The Lord GOD hath opened mine ear, and I was not rebellious,
        neither turned away back.

050:006 I gave my back to the smiters, and my cheeks to them that
        plucked off the hair: I hid not my face from shame and
        spitting.

050:007 For the Lord GOD will help me; therefore shall I not be
        confounded: therefore have I set my face like a flint, and I
        know that I shall not be ashamed.

050:008 He is near that justifieth me; who will contend with me? let
        us stand together: who is mine adversary? let him come near to
        me.

050:009 Behold, the Lord GOD will help me; who is he that shall
        condemn me? lo, they all shall wax old as a garment; the moth
        shall eat them up.

050:010 Who is among you that feareth the LORD, that obeyeth the voice
        of his servant, that walketh in darkness, and hath no light?
        let him trust in the name of the LORD, and stay upon his God.

050:011 Behold, all ye that kindle a fire, that compass yourselves
        about with sparks: walk in the light of your fire, and in the
        sparks that ye have kindled. This shall ye have of mine hand;
        ye shall lie down in sorrow.

051:001 Hearken to me, ye that follow after righteousness, ye that
        seek the LORD: look unto the rock whence ye are hewn, and to
        the hole of the pit whence ye are digged.

051:002 Look unto Abraham your father, and unto Sarah that bare you:
        for I called him alone, and blessed him, and increased him.

051:003 For the LORD shall comfort Zion: he will comfort all her waste
        places; and he will make her wilderness like Eden, and her
        desert like the garden of the LORD; joy and gladness shall be
        found therein, thanksgiving, and the voice of melody.

051:004 Hearken unto me, my people; and give ear unto me, O my nation:
        for a law shall proceed from me, and I will make my judgment
        to rest for a light of the people.

051:005 My righteousness is near; my salvation is gone forth, and mine
        arms shall judge the people; the isles shall wait upon me, and
        on mine arm shall they trust.

051:006 Lift up your eyes to the heavens, and look upon the earth
        beneath: for the heavens shall vanish away like smoke, and the
        earth shall wax old like a garment, and they that dwell
        therein shall die in like manner: but my salvation shall be
        for ever, and my righteousness shall not be abolished.

051:007 Hearken unto me, ye that know righteousness, the people in
        whose heart is my law; fear ye not the reproach of men,
        neither be ye afraid of their revilings.

051:008 For the moth shall eat them up like a garment, and the worm
        shall eat them like wool: but my righteousness shall be for
        ever, and my salvation from generation to generation.

051:009 Awake, awake, put on strength, O arm of the LORD; awake, as in
        the ancient days, in the generations of old. Art thou not it
        that hath cut Rahab, and wounded the dragon?

051:010 Art thou not it which hath dried the sea, the waters of the
        great deep; that hath made the depths of the sea a way for the
        ransomed to pass over?

051:011 Therefore the redeemed of the LORD shall return, and come with
        singing unto Zion; and everlasting joy shall be upon their
        head: they shall obtain gladness and joy; and sorrow and
        mourning shall flee away.

051:012 I, even I, am he that comforteth you: who art thou, that thou
        shouldest be afraid of a man that shall die, and of the son of
        man which shall be made as grass;

051:013 And forgettest the LORD thy maker, that hath stretched forth
        the heavens, and laid the foundations of the earth; and hast
        feared continually every day because of the fury of the
        oppressor, as if he were ready to destroy? and where is the
        fury of the oppressor?

051:014 The captive exile hasteneth that he may be loosed, and that he
        should not die in the pit, nor that his bread should fail.

051:015 But I am the LORD thy God, that divided the sea, whose waves
        roared: The LORD of hosts is his name.

051:016 And I have put my words in thy mouth, and I have covered thee
        in the shadow of mine hand, that I may plant the heavens, and
        lay the foundations of the earth, and say unto Zion, Thou art
        my people.

051:017 Awake, awake, stand up, O Jerusalem, which hast drunk at the
        hand of the LORD the cup of his fury; thou hast drunken the
        dregs of the cup of trembling, and wrung them out.

051:018 There is none to guide her among all the sons whom she hath
        brought forth; neither is there any that taketh her by the
        hand of all the sons that she hath brought up.

051:019 These two things are come unto thee; who shall be sorry for
        thee? desolation, and destruction, and the famine, and the
        sword: by whom shall I comfort thee?

051:020 Thy sons have fainted, they lie at the head of all the
        streets, as a wild bull in a net: they are full of the fury of
        the LORD, the rebuke of thy God.

051:021 Therefore hear now this, thou afflicted, and drunken, but not
        with wine:

051:022 Thus saith thy Lord the LORD, and thy God that pleadeth the
        cause of his people, Behold, I have taken out of thine hand
        the cup of trembling, even the dregs of the cup of my fury;
        thou shalt no more drink it again:

051:023 But I will put it into the hand of them that afflict thee;
        which have said to thy soul, Bow down, that we may go over:
        and thou hast laid thy body as the ground, and as the street,
        to them that went over.

052:001 Awake, awake; put on thy strength, O Zion; put on thy
        beautiful garments, O Jerusalem, the holy city: for henceforth
        there shall no more come into thee the uncircumcised and the
        unclean.

052:002 Shake thyself from the dust; arise, and sit down, O Jerusalem:
        loose thyself from the bands of thy neck, O captive daughter
        of Zion.

052:003 For thus saith the LORD, Ye have sold yourselves for nought;
        and ye shall be redeemed without money.

052:004 For thus saith the Lord GOD, My people went down aforetime
        into Egypt to sojourn there; and the Assyrian oppressed them
        without cause.

052:005 Now therefore, what have I here, saith the LORD, that my
        people is taken away for nought? they that rule over them make
        them to howl, saith the LORD; and my name continually every
        day is blasphemed.

052:006 Therefore my people shall know my name: therefore they shall
        know in that day that I am he that doth speak: behold, it is
        I.

052:007 How beautiful upon the mountains are the feet of him that
        bringeth good tidings, that publisheth peace; that bringeth
        good tidings of good, that publisheth salvation; that saith
        unto Zion, Thy God reigneth!

052:008 Thy watchmen shall lift up the voice; with the voice together
        shall they sing: for they shall see eye to eye, when the LORD
        shall bring again Zion.

052:009 Break forth into joy, sing together, ye waste places of
        Jerusalem: for the LORD hath comforted his people, he hath
        redeemed Jerusalem.

052:010 The LORD hath made bare his holy arm in the eyes of all the
        nations; and all the ends of the earth shall see the salvation
        of our God.

052:011 Depart ye, depart ye, go ye out from thence, touch no unclean
        thing; go ye out of the midst of her; be ye clean, that bear
        the vessels of the LORD.

052:012 For ye shall not go out with haste, nor go by flight: for the
        LORD will go before you; and the God of Israel will be your
        rereward.

052:013 Behold, my servant shall deal prudently, he shall be exalted
        and extolled, and be very high.

052:014 As many were astonied at thee; his visage was so marred more
        than any man, and his form more than the sons of men:

052:015 So shall he sprinkle many nations; the kings shall shut their
        mouths at him: for that which had not been told them shall
        they see; and that which they had not heard shall they
        consider.

053:001 Who hath believed our report? and to whom is the arm of the
        LORD revealed?

053:002 For he shall grow up before him as a tender plant, and as a
        root out of a dry ground: he hath no form nor comeliness; and
        when we shall see him, there is no beauty that we should
        desire him.

053:003 He is despised and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and
        acquainted with grief: and we hid as it were our faces from
        him; he was despised, and we esteemed him not.

053:004 Surely he hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows: yet
        we did esteem him stricken, smitten of God, and afflicted.

053:005 But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for
        our iniquities: the chastisement of our peace was upon him;
        and with his stripes we are healed.

053:006 All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one
        to his own way; and the LORD hath laid on him the iniquity of
        us all.

053:007 He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his
        mouth: he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter, and as a
        sheep before her shearers is dumb, so he openeth not his
        mouth.

053:008 He was taken from prison and from judgment: and who shall
        declare his generation? for he was cut off out of the land of
        the living: for the transgression of my people was he
        stricken.

053:009 And he made his grave with the wicked, and with the rich in
        his death; because he had done no violence, neither was any
        deceit in his mouth.

053:010 Yet it pleased the LORD to bruise him; he hath put him to
        grief: when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin, he
        shall see his seed, he shall prolong his days, and the
        pleasure of the LORD shall prosper in his hand.

053:011 He shall see of the travail of his soul, and shall be
        satisfied: by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify
        many; for he shall bear their iniquities.

053:012 Therefore will I divide him a portion with the great, and he
        shall divide the spoil with the strong; because he hath poured
        out his soul unto death: and he was numbered with the
        transgressors; and he bare the sin of many, and made
        intercession for the transgressors.

054:001 Sing, O barren, thou that didst not bear; break forth into
        singing, and cry aloud, thou that didst not travail with
        child: for more are the children of the desolate than the
        children of the married wife, saith the LORD.

054:002 Enlarge the place of thy tent, and let them stretch forth the
        curtains of thine habitations: spare not, lengthen thy cords,
        and strengthen thy stakes;

054:003 For thou shalt break forth on the right hand and on the left;
        and thy seed shall inherit the Gentiles, and make the desolate
        cities to be inhabited.

054:004 Fear not; for thou shalt not be ashamed: neither be thou
        confounded; for thou shalt not be put to shame: for thou shalt
        forget the shame of thy youth, and shalt not remember the
        reproach of thy widowhood any more.

054:005 For thy Maker is thine husband; the LORD of hosts is his name;
        and thy Redeemer the Holy One of Israel; The God of the whole
        earth shall he be called.

054:006 For the LORD hath called thee as a woman forsaken and grieved
        in spirit, and a wife of youth, when thou wast refused, saith
        thy God.

054:007 For a small moment have I forsaken thee; but with great
        mercies will I gather thee.

054:008 In a little wrath I hid my face from thee for a moment; but
        with everlasting kindness will I have mercy on thee, saith the
        LORD thy Redeemer.

054:009 For this is as the waters of Noah unto me: for as I have sworn
        that the waters of Noah should no more go over the earth; so
        have I sworn that I would not be wroth with thee, nor rebuke
        thee.

054:010 For the mountains shall depart, and the hills be removed; but
        my kindness shall not depart from thee, neither shall the
        covenant of my peace be removed, saith the LORD that hath
        mercy on thee.

054:011 O thou afflicted, tossed with tempest, and not comforted,
        behold, I will lay thy stones with fair colours, and lay thy
        foundations with sapphires.

054:012 And I will make thy windows of agates, and thy gates of
        carbuncles, and all thy borders of pleasant stones.

054:013 And all thy children shall be taught of the LORD; and great
        shall be the peace of thy children.

054:014 In righteousness shalt thou be established: thou shalt be far
        from oppression; for thou shalt not fear: and from terror; for
        it shall not come near thee.

054:015 Behold, they shall surely gather together, but not by me:
        whosoever shall gather together against thee shall fall for
        thy sake.

054:016 Behold, I have created the smith that bloweth the coals in the
        fire, and that bringeth forth an instrument for his work; and
        I have created the waster to destroy.

054:017 No weapon that is formed against thee shall prosper; and every
        tongue that shall rise against thee in judgment thou shalt
        condemn. This is the heritage of the servants of the LORD, and
        their righteousness is of me, saith the LORD.

055:001 Ho, every one that thirsteth, come ye to the waters, and he
        that hath no money; come ye, buy, and eat; yea, come, buy wine
        and milk without money and without price.

055:002 Wherefore do ye spend money for that which is not bread? and
        your labour for that which satisfieth not? hearken diligently
        unto me, and eat ye that which is good, and let your soul
        delight itself in fatness.

055:003 Incline your ear, and come unto me: hear, and your soul shall
        live; and I will make an everlasting covenant with you, even
        the sure mercies of David.

055:004 Behold, I have given him for a witness to the people, a leader
        and commander to the people.

055:005 Behold, thou shalt call a nation that thou knowest not, and
        nations that knew not thee shall run unto thee because of the
        LORD thy God, and for the Holy One of Israel; for he hath
        glorified thee.

055:006 Seek ye the LORD while he may be found, call ye upon him while
        he is near:

055:007 Let the wicked forsake his way, and the unrighteous man his
        thoughts: and let him return unto the LORD, and he will have
        mercy upon him; and to our God, for he will abundantly pardon.

055:008 For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways
        my ways, saith the LORD.

055:009 For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways
        higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts.

055:010 For as the rain cometh down, and the snow from heaven, and
        returneth not thither, but watereth the earth, and maketh it
        bring forth and bud, that it may give seed to the sower, and
        bread to the eater:

055:011 So shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth: it shall
        not return unto me void, but it shall accomplish that which I
        please, and it shall prosper in the thing whereto I sent it.

055:012 For ye shall go out with joy, and be led forth with peace: the
        mountains and the hills shall break forth before you into
        singing, and all the trees of the field shall clap their
        hands.

055:013 Instead of the thorn shall come up the fir tree, and instead
        of the brier shall come up the myrtle tree: and it shall be to
        the LORD for a name, for an everlasting sign that shall not be
        cut off.

056:001 Thus saith the LORD, Keep ye judgment, and do justice: for my
        salvation is near to come, and my righteousness to be
        revealed.

056:002 Blessed is the man that doeth this, and the son of man that
        layeth hold on it; that keepeth the sabbath from polluting it,
        and keepeth his hand from doing any evil.

056:003 Neither let the son of the stranger, that hath joined himself
        to the LORD, speak, saying, The LORD hath utterly separated me
        from his people: neither let the eunuch say, Behold, I am a
        dry tree.

056:004 For thus saith the LORD unto the eunuchs that keep my
        sabbaths, and choose the things that please me, and take hold
        of my covenant;

056:005 Even unto them will I give in mine house and within my walls a
        place and a name better than of sons and of daughters: I will
        give them an everlasting name, that shall not be cut off.

056:006 Also the sons of the stranger, that join themselves to the
        LORD, to serve him, and to love the name of the LORD, to be
        his servants, every one that keepeth the sabbath from
        polluting it, and taketh hold of my covenant;

056:007 Even them will I bring to my holy mountain, and make them
        joyful in my house of prayer: their burnt offerings and their
        sacrifices shall be accepted upon mine altar; for mine house
        shall be called an house of prayer for all people.

056:008 The Lord GOD, which gathereth the outcasts of Israel saith,
        Yet will I gather others to him, beside those that are
        gathered unto him.

056:009 All ye beasts of the field, come to devour, yea, all ye beasts
        in the forest.

056:010 His watchmen are blind: they are all ignorant, they are all
        dumb dogs, they cannot bark; sleeping, lying down, loving to
        slumber.

056:011 Yea, they are greedy dogs which can never have enough, and
        they are shepherds that cannot understand: they all look to
        their own way, every one for his gain, from his quarter.

056:012 Come ye, say they, I will fetch wine, and we will fill
        ourselves with strong drink; and to morrow shall be as this
        day, and much more abundant.

057:001 The righteous perisheth, and no man layeth it to heart: and
        merciful men are taken away, none considering that the
        righteous is taken away from the evil to come.

057:002 He shall enter into peace: they shall rest in their beds, each
        one walking in his uprightness.

057:003 But draw near hither, ye sons of the sorceress, the seed of
        the adulterer and the whore.

057:004 Against whom do ye sport yourselves? against whom make ye a
        wide mouth, and draw out the tongue? are ye not children of
        transgression, a seed of falsehood.

057:005 Enflaming yourselves with idols under every green tree,
        slaying the children in the valleys under the clifts of the
        rocks?

057:006 Among the smooth stones of the stream is thy portion; they,
        they are thy lot: even to them hast thou poured a drink
        offering, thou hast offered a meat offering. Should I receive
        comfort in these?

057:007 Upon a lofty and high mountain hast thou set thy bed: even
        thither wentest thou up to offer sacrifice.

057:008 Behind the doors also and the posts hast thou set up thy
        remembrance: for thou hast discovered thyself to another than
        me, and art gone up; thou hast enlarged thy bed, and made thee
        a covenant with them; thou lovedst their bed where thou sawest
        it.

057:009 And thou wentest to the king with ointment, and didst increase
        thy perfumes, and didst send thy messengers far off, and didst
        debase thyself even unto hell.

057:010 Thou art wearied in the greatness of thy way; yet saidst thou
        not, There is no hope: thou hast found the life of thine hand;
        therefore thou wast not grieved.

057:011 And of whom hast thou been afraid or feared, that thou hast
        lied, and hast not remembered me, nor laid it to thy heart?
        have not I held my peace even of old, and thou fearest me not?

057:012 I will declare thy righteousness, and thy works; for they
        shall not profit thee.

057:013 When thou criest, let thy companies deliver thee; but the wind
        shall carry them all away; vanity shall take them: but he that
        putteth his trust in me shall possess the land, and shall
        inherit my holy mountain;

057:014 And shall say, Cast ye up, cast ye up, prepare the way, take
        up the stumblingblock out of the way of my people.

057:015 For thus saith the high and lofty One that inhabiteth
        eternity, whose name is Holy; I dwell in the high and holy
        place, with him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit,
        to revive the spirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of
        the contrite ones.

057:016 For I will not contend for ever, neither will I be always
        wroth: for the spirit should fail before me, and the souls
        which I have made.

057:017 For the iniquity of his covetousness was I wroth, and smote
        him: I hid me, and was wroth, and he went on frowardly in the
        way of his heart.

057:018 I have seen his ways, and will heal him: I will lead him also,
        and restore comforts unto him and to his mourners.

057:019 I create the fruit of the lips; Peace, peace to him that is
        far off, and to him that is near, saith the LORD; and I will
        heal him.

057:020 But the wicked are like the troubled sea, when it cannot rest,
        whose waters cast up mire and dirt.

057:021 There is no peace, saith my God, to the wicked.

058:001 Cry aloud, spare not, lift up thy voice like a trumpet, and
        shew my people their transgression, and the house of Jacob
        their sins.

058:002 Yet they seek me daily, and delight to know my ways, as a
        nation that did righteousness, and forsook not the ordinance
        of their God: they ask of me the ordinances of justice; they
        take delight in approaching to God.

058:003 Wherefore have we fasted, say they, and thou seest not?
        wherefore have we afflicted our soul, and thou takest no
        knowledge? Behold, in the day of your fast ye find pleasure,
        and exact all your labours.

058:004 Behold, ye fast for strife and debate, and to smite with the
        fist of wickedness: ye shall not fast as ye do this day, to
        make your voice to be heard on high.

058:005 Is it such a fast that I have chosen? a day for a man to
        afflict his soul? is it to bow down his head as a bulrush, and
        to spread sackcloth and ashes under him? wilt thou call this a
        fast, and an acceptable day to the LORD?

058:006 Is not this the fast that I have chosen? to loose the bands of
        wickedness, to undo the heavy burdens, and to let the
        oppressed go free, and that ye break every yoke?

058:007 Is it not to deal thy bread to the hungry, and that thou bring
        the poor that are cast out to thy house? when thou seest the
        naked, that thou cover him; and that thou hide not thyself
        from thine own flesh?

058:008 Then shall thy light break forth as the morning, and thine
        health shall spring forth speedily: and thy righteousness
        shall go before thee; the glory of the LORD shall be thy
        rereward.

058:009 Then shalt thou call, and the LORD shall answer; thou shalt
        cry, and he shall say, Here I am. If thou take away from the
        midst of thee the yoke, the putting forth of the finger, and
        speaking vanity;

058:010 And if thou draw out thy soul to the hungry, and satisfy the
        afflicted soul; then shall thy light rise in obscurity, and
        thy darkness be as the noon day:

058:011 And the LORD shall guide thee continually, and satisfy thy
        soul in drought, and make fat thy bones: and thou shalt be
        like a watered garden, and like a spring of water, whose
        waters fail not.

058:012 And they that shall be of thee shall build the old waste
        places: thou shalt raise up the foundations of many
        generations; and thou shalt be called, The repairer of the
        breach, The restorer of paths to dwell in.

058:013 If thou turn away thy foot from the sabbath, from doing thy
        pleasure on my holy day; and call the sabbath a delight, the
        holy of the LORD, honourable; and shalt honour him, not doing
        thine own ways, nor finding thine own pleasure, nor speaking
        thine own words:

058:014 Then shalt thou delight thyself in the LORD; and I will cause
        thee to ride upon the high places of the earth, and feed thee
        with the heritage of Jacob thy father: for the mouth of the
        LORD hath spoken it.

059:001 Behold, the LORD's hand is not shortened, that it cannot save;
        neither his ear heavy, that it cannot hear:

059:002 But your iniquities have separated between you and your God,
        and your sins have hid his face from you, that he will not
        hear.

059:003 For your hands are defiled with blood, and your fingers with
        iniquity; your lips have spoken lies, your tongue hath
        muttered perverseness.

059:004 None calleth for justice, nor any pleadeth for truth: they
        trust in vanity, and speak lies; they conceive mischief, and
        bring forth iniquity.

059:005 They hatch cockatrice' eggs, and weave the spider's web: he
        that eateth of their eggs dieth, and that which is crushed
        breaketh out into a viper.

059:006 Their webs shall not become garments, neither shall they cover
        themselves with their works: their works are works of
        iniquity, and the act of violence is in their hands.

059:007 Their feet run to evil, and they make haste to shed innocent
        blood: their thoughts are thoughts of iniquity; wasting and
        destruction are in their paths.

059:008 The way of peace they know not; and there is no judgment in
        their goings: they have made them crooked paths: whosoever
        goeth therein shall not know peace.

059:009 Therefore is judgment far from us, neither doth justice
        overtake us: we wait for light, but behold obscurity; for
        brightness, but we walk in darkness.

059:010 We grope for the wall like the blind, and we grope as if we
        had no eyes: we stumble at noon day as in the night; we are in
        desolate places as dead men.

059:011 We roar all like bears, and mourn sore like doves: we look for
        judgment, but there is none; for salvation, but it is far off
        from us.

059:012 For our transgressions are multiplied before thee, and our
        sins testify against us: for our transgressions are with us;
        and as for our iniquities, we know them;

059:013 In transgressing and lying against the LORD, and departing
        away from our God, speaking oppression and revolt, conceiving
        and uttering from the heart words of falsehood.

059:014 And judgment is turned away backward, and justice standeth
        afar off: for truth is fallen in the street, and equity cannot
        enter.

059:015 Yea, truth faileth; and he that departeth from evil maketh
        himself a prey: and the LORD saw it, and it displeased him
        that there was no judgment.

059:016 And he saw that there was no man, and wondered that there was
        no intercessor: therefore his arm brought salvation unto him;
        and his righteousness, it sustained him.

059:017 For he put on righteousness as a breastplate, and an helmet of
        salvation upon his head; and he put on the garments of
        vengeance for clothing, and was clad with zeal as a cloak.

059:018 According to their deeds, accordingly he will repay, fury to
        his adversaries, recompence to his enemies; to the islands he
        will repay recompence.

059:019 So shall they fear the name of the LORD from the west, and his
        glory from the rising of the sun. When the enemy shall come in
        like a flood, the Spirit of the LORD shall lift up a standard
        against him.

059:020 And the Redeemer shall come to Zion, and unto them that turn
        from transgression in Jacob, saith the LORD.

059:021 As for me, this is my covenant with them, saith the LORD; My
        spirit that is upon thee, and my words which I have put in thy
        mouth, shall not depart out of thy mouth, nor out of the mouth
        of thy seed, nor out of the mouth of thy seed's seed, saith
        the LORD, from henceforth and for ever.

060:001 Arise, shine; for thy light is come, and the glory of the LORD
        is risen upon thee.

060:002 For, behold, the darkness shall cover the earth, and gross
        darkness the people: but the LORD shall arise upon thee, and
        his glory shall be seen upon thee.

060:003 And the Gentiles shall come to thy light, and kings to the
        brightness of thy rising.

060:004 Lift up thine eyes round about, and see: all they gather
        themselves together, they come to thee: thy sons shall come
        from far, and thy daughters shall be nursed at thy side.

060:005 Then thou shalt see, and flow together, and thine heart shall
        fear, and be enlarged; because the abundance of the sea shall
        be converted unto thee, the forces of the Gentiles shall come
        unto thee.

060:006 The multitude of camels shall cover thee, the dromedaries of
        Midian and Ephah; all they from Sheba shall come: they shall
        bring gold and incense; and they shall shew forth the praises
        of the LORD.

060:007 All the flocks of Kedar shall be gathered together unto thee,
        the rams of Nebaioth shall minister unto thee: they shall come
        up with acceptance on mine altar, and I will glorify the house
        of my glory.

060:008 Who are these that fly as a cloud, and as the doves to their
        windows?

060:009 Surely the isles shall wait for me, and the ships of Tarshish
        first, to bring thy sons from far, their silver and their gold
        with them, unto the name of the LORD thy God, and to the Holy
        One of Israel, because he hath glorified thee.

060:010 And the sons of strangers shall build up thy walls, and their
        kings shall minister unto thee: for in my wrath I smote thee,
        but in my favour have I had mercy on thee.

060:011 Therefore thy gates shall be open continually; they shall not
        be shut day nor night; that men may bring unto thee the forces
        of the Gentiles, and that their kings may be brought.

060:012 For the nation and kingdom that will not serve thee shall
        perish; yea, those nations shall be utterly wasted.

060:013 The glory of Lebanon shall come unto thee, the fir tree, the
        pine tree, and the box together, to beautify the place of my
        sanctuary; and I will make the place of my feet glorious.

060:014 The sons also of them that afflicted thee shall come bending
        unto thee; and all they that despised thee shall bow
        themselves down at the soles of thy feet; and they shall call
        thee; The city of the LORD, The Zion of the Holy One of
        Israel.

060:015 Whereas thou has been forsaken and hated, so that no man went
        through thee, I will make thee an eternal excellency, a joy of
        many generations.

060:016 Thou shalt also suck the milk of the Gentiles, and shalt suck
        the breast of kings: and thou shalt know that I the LORD am
        thy Saviour and thy Redeemer, the mighty One of Jacob.

060:017 For brass I will bring gold, and for iron I will bring silver,
        and for wood brass, and for stones iron: I will also make thy
        officers peace, and thine exactors righteousness.

060:018 Violence shall no more be heard in thy land, wasting nor
        destruction within thy borders; but thou shalt call thy walls
        Salvation, and thy gates Praise.

060:019 The sun shall be no more thy light by day; neither for
        brightness shall the moon give light unto thee: but the LORD
        shall be unto thee an everlasting light, and thy God thy
        glory.

060:020 Thy sun shall no more go down; neither shall thy moon withdraw
        itself: for the LORD shall be thine everlasting light, and the
        days of thy mourning shall be ended.

060:021 Thy people also shall be all righteous: they shall inherit the
        land for ever, the branch of my planting, the work of my
        hands, that I may be glorified.

060:022 A little one shall become a thousand, and a small one a strong
        nation: I the LORD will hasten it in his time.

061:001 The Spirit of the Lord GOD is upon me; because the LORD hath
        anointed me to preach good tidings unto the meek; he hath sent
        me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the
        captives, and the opening of the prison to them that are
        bound;

061:002 To proclaim the acceptable year of the LORD, and the day of
        vengeance of our God; to comfort all that mourn;

061:003 To appoint unto them that mourn in Zion, to give unto them
        beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for mourning, the garment of
        praise for the spirit of heaviness; that they might be called
        trees of righteousness, the planting of the LORD, that he
        might be glorified.

061:004 And they shall build the old wastes, they shall raise up the
        former desolations, and they shall repair the waste cities,
        the desolations of many generations.

061:005 And strangers shall stand and feed your flocks, and the sons
        of the alien shall be your plowmen and your vinedressers.

061:006 But ye shall be named the Priests of the LORD: men shall call
        you the Ministers of our God: ye shall eat the riches of the
        Gentiles, and in their glory shall ye boast yourselves.

061:007 For your shame ye shall have double; and for confusion they
        shall rejoice in their portion: therefore in their land they
        shall possess the double: everlasting joy shall be unto them.

061:008 For I the LORD love judgment, I hate robbery for burnt
        offering; and I will direct their work in truth, and I will
        make an everlasting covenant with them.

061:009 And their seed shall be known among the Gentiles, and their
        offspring among the people: all that see them shall
        acknowledge them, that they are the seed which the LORD hath
        blessed.

061:010 I will greatly rejoice in the LORD, my soul shall be joyful in
        my God; for he hath clothed me with the garments of salvation,
        he hath covered me with the robe of righteousness, as a
        bridegroom decketh himself with ornaments, and as a bride
        adorneth herself with her jewels.

061:011 For as the earth bringeth forth her bud, and as the garden
        causeth the things that are sown in it to spring forth; so the
        Lord GOD will cause righteousness and praise to spring forth
        before all the nations.

062:001 For Zion's sake will I not hold my peace, and for Jerusalem's
        sake I will not rest, until the righteousness thereof go forth
        as brightness, and the salvation thereof as a lamp that
        burneth.

062:002 And the Gentiles shall see thy righteousness, and all kings
        thy glory: and thou shalt be called by a new name, which the
        mouth of the LORD shall name.

062:003 Thou shalt also be a crown of glory in the hand of the LORD,
        and a royal diadem in the hand of thy God.

062:004 Thou shalt no more be termed Forsaken; neither shall thy land
        any more be termed Desolate: but thou shalt be called
        Hephzibah, and thy land Beulah: for the LORD delighteth in
        thee, and thy land shall be married.

062:005 For as a young man marrieth a virgin, so shall thy sons marry
        thee: and as the bridegroom rejoiceth over the bride, so shall
        thy God rejoice over thee.

062:006 I have set watchmen upon thy walls, O Jerusalem, which shall
        never hold their peace day nor night: ye that make mention of
        the LORD, keep not silence,

062:007 And give him no rest, till he establish, and till he make
        Jerusalem a praise in the earth.

062:008 The LORD hath sworn by his right hand, and by the arm of his
        strength, Surely I will no more give thy corn to be meat for
        thine enemies; and the sons of the stranger shall not drink
        thy wine, for the which thou hast laboured:

062:009 But they that have gathered it shall eat it, and praise the
        LORD; and they that have brought it together shall drink it in
        the courts of my holiness.

062:010 Go through, go through the gates; prepare ye the way of the
        people; cast up, cast up the highway; gather out the stones;
        lift up a standard for the people.

062:011 Behold, the LORD hath proclaimed unto the end of the world,
        Say ye to the daughter of Zion, Behold, thy salvation cometh;
        behold, his reward is with him, and his work before him.

062:012 And they shall call them, The holy people, The redeemed of the
        LORD: and thou shalt be called, Sought out, A city not
        forsaken.

063:001 Who is this that cometh from Edom, with dyed garments from
        Bozrah? this that is glorious in his apparel, travelling in
        the greatness of his strength? I that speak in righteousness,
        mighty to save.

063:002 Wherefore art thou red in thine apparel, and thy garments like
        him that treadeth in the winefat?

063:003 I have trodden the winepress alone; and of the people there
        was none with me: for I will tread them in mine anger, and
        trample them in my fury; and their blood shall be sprinkled
        upon my garments, and I will stain all my raiment.

063:004 For the day of vengeance is in mine heart, and the year of my
        redeemed is come.

063:005 And I looked, and there was none to help; and I wondered that
        there was none to uphold: therefore mine own arm brought
        salvation unto me; and my fury, it upheld me.

063:006 And I will tread down the people in mine anger, and make them
        drunk in my fury, and I will bring down their strength to the
        earth.

063:007 I will mention the lovingkindnesses of the LORD, and the
        praises of the LORD, according to all that the LORD hath
        bestowed on us, and the great goodness toward the house of
        Israel, which he hath bestowed on them according to his
        mercies, and according to the multitude of his
        lovingkindnesses.

063:008 For he said, Surely they are my people, children that will not
        lie: so he was their Saviour.

063:009 In all their affliction he was afflicted, and the angel of his
        presence saved them: in his love and in his pity he redeemed
        them; and he bare them, and carried them all the days of old.

063:010 But they rebelled, and vexed his holy Spirit: therefore he was
        turned to be their enemy, and he fought against them.

063:011 Then he remembered the days of old, Moses, and his people,
        saying, Where is he that brought them up out of the sea with
        the shepherd of his flock? where is he that put his holy
        Spirit within him?

063:012 That led them by the right hand of Moses with his glorious
        arm, dividing the water before them, to make himself an
        everlasting name?

063:013 That led them through the deep, as an horse in the wilderness,
        that they should not stumble?

063:014 As a beast goeth down into the valley, the Spirit of the LORD
        caused him to rest: so didst thou lead thy people, to make
        thyself a glorious name.

063:015 Look down from heaven, and behold from the habitation of thy
        holiness and of thy glory: where is thy zeal and thy strength,
        the sounding of thy bowels and of thy mercies toward me? are
        they restrained?

063:016 Doubtless thou art our father, though Abraham be ignorant of
        us, and Israel acknowledge us not: thou, O LORD, art our
        father, our redeemer; thy name is from everlasting.

063:017 O LORD, why hast thou made us to err from thy ways, and
        hardened our heart from thy fear? Return for thy servants'
        sake, the tribes of thine inheritance.

063:018 The people of thy holiness have possessed it but a little
        while: our adversaries have trodden down thy sanctuary.

063:019 We are thine: thou never barest rule over them; they were not
        called by thy name.

064:001 Oh that thou wouldest rend the heavens, that thou wouldest
        come down, that the mountains might flow down at thy presence,

064:002 As when the melting fire burneth, the fire causeth the waters
        to boil, to make thy name known to thine adversaries, that the
        nations may tremble at thy presence!

064:003 When thou didst terrible things which we looked not for, thou
        camest down, the mountains flowed down at thy presence.

064:004 For since the beginning of the world men have not heard, nor
        perceived by the ear, neither hath the eye seen, O God, beside
        thee, what he hath prepared for him that waiteth for him.

064:005 Thou meetest him that rejoiceth and worketh righteousness,
        those that remember thee in thy ways: behold, thou art wroth;
        for we have sinned: in those is continuance, and we shall be
        saved.

064:006 But we are all as an unclean thing, and all our
        righteousnesses are as filthy rags; and we all do fade as a
        leaf; and our iniquities, like the wind, have taken us away.

064:007 And there is none that calleth upon thy name, that stirreth up
        himself to take hold of thee: for thou hast hid thy face from
        us, and hast consumed us, because of our iniquities.

064:008 But now, O LORD, thou art our father; we are the clay, and
        thou our potter; and we all are the work of thy hand.

064:009 Be not wroth very sore, O LORD, neither remember iniquity for
        ever: behold, see, we beseech thee, we are all thy people.

064:010 Thy holy cities are a wilderness, Zion is a wilderness,
        Jerusalem a desolation.

064:011 Our holy and our beautiful house, where our fathers praised
        thee, is burned up with fire: and all our pleasant things are
        laid waste.

064:012 Wilt thou refrain thyself for these things, O LORD? wilt thou
        hold thy peace, and afflict us very sore?

065:001 I am sought of them that asked not for me; I am found of them
        that sought me not: I said, Behold me, behold me, unto a
        nation that was not called by my name.

065:002 I have spread out my hands all the day unto a rebellious
        people, which walketh in a way that was not good, after their
        own thoughts;

065:003 A people that provoketh me to anger continually to my face;
        that sacrificeth in gardens, and burneth incense upon altars
        of brick;

065:004 Which remain among the graves, and lodge in the monuments,
        which eat swine's flesh, and broth of abominable things is in
        their vessels;

065:005 Which say, Stand by thyself, come not near to me; for I am
        holier than thou. These are a smoke in my nose, a fire that
        burneth all the day.

065:006 Behold, it is written before me: I will not keep silence, but
        will recompense, even recompense into their bosom,

065:007 Your iniquities, and the iniquities of your fathers together,
        saith the LORD, which have burned incense upon the mountains,
        and blasphemed me upon the hills: therefore will I measure
        their former work into their bosom.

065:008 Thus saith the LORD, As the new wine is found in the cluster,
        and one saith, Destroy it not; for a blessing is in it: so
        will I do for my servants' sakes, that I may not destroy them
        all.

065:009 And I will bring forth a seed out of Jacob, and out of Judah
        an inheritor of my mountains: and mine elect shall inherit it,
        and my servants shall dwell there.

065:010 And Sharon shall be a fold of flocks, and the valley of Achor
        a place for the herds to lie down in, for my people that have
        sought me.

065:011 But ye are they that forsake the LORD, that forget my holy
        mountain, that prepare a table for that troop, and that
        furnish the drink offering unto that number.

065:012 Therefore will I number you to the sword, and ye shall all bow
        down to the slaughter: because when I called, ye did not
        answer; when I spake, ye did not hear; but did evil before
        mine eyes, and did choose that wherein I delighted not.

065:013 Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD, Behold, my servants shall
        eat, but ye shall be hungry: behold, my servants shall drink,
        but ye shall be thirsty: behold, my servants shall rejoice,
        but ye shall be ashamed:

065:014 Behold, my servants shall sing for joy of heart, but ye shall
        cry for sorrow of heart, and shall howl for vexation of
        spirit.

065:015 And ye shall leave your name for a curse unto my chosen: for
        the Lord GOD shall slay thee, and call his servants by another
        name:

065:016 That he who blesseth himself in the earth shall bless himself
        in the God of truth; and he that sweareth in the earth shall
        swear by the God of truth; because the former troubles are
        forgotten, and because they are hid from mine eyes.

065:017 For, behold, I create new heavens and a new earth: and the
        former shall not be remembered, nor come into mind.

065:018 But be ye glad and rejoice for ever in that which I create:
        for, behold, I create Jerusalem a rejoicing, and her people a
        joy.

065:019 And I will rejoice in Jerusalem, and joy in my people: and the
        voice of weeping shall be no more heard in her, nor the voice
        of crying.

065:020 There shall be no more thence an infant of days, nor an old
        man that hath not filled his days: for the child shall die an
        hundred years old; but the sinner being an hundred years old
        shall be accursed.

065:021 And they shall build houses, and inhabit them; and they shall
        plant vineyards, and eat the fruit of them.

065:022 They shall not build, and another inhabit; they shall not
        plant, and another eat: for as the days of a tree are the days
        of my people, and mine elect shall long enjoy the work of
        their hands.

065:023 They shall not labour in vain, nor bring forth for trouble;
        for they are the seed of the blessed of the LORD, and their
        offspring with them.

065:024 And it shall come to pass, that before they call, I will
        answer; and while they are yet speaking, I will hear.

065:025 The wolf and the lamb shall feed together, and the lion shall
        eat straw like the bullock: and dust shall be the serpent's
        meat. They shall not hurt nor destroy in all my holy mountain,
        saith the LORD.

066:001 Thus saith the LORD, The heaven is my throne, and the earth is
        my footstool: where is the house that ye build unto me? and
        where is the place of my rest?

066:002 For all those things hath mine hand made, and all those things
        have been, saith the LORD: but to this man will I look, even
        to him that is poor and of a contrite spirit, and trembleth at
        my word.

066:003 He that killeth an ox is as if he slew a man; he that
        sacrificeth a lamb, as if he cut off a dog's neck; he that
        offereth an oblation, as if he offered swine's blood; he that
        burneth incense, as if he blessed an idol. Yea, they have
