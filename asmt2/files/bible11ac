        thee to possess it, all the days that ye live upon the earth.

012:002 Ye shall utterly destroy all the places, wherein the nations
        which ye shall possess served their gods, upon the high
        mountains, and upon the hills, and under every green tree:

012:003 And ye shall overthrow their altars, and break their pillars,
        and burn their groves with fire; and ye shall hew down the
        graven images of their gods, and destroy the names of them out
        of that place.

012:004 Ye shall not do so unto the LORD your God.

012:005 But unto the place which the LORD your God shall choose out of
        all your tribes to put his name there, even unto his
        habitation shall ye seek, and thither thou shalt come:

012:006 And thither ye shall bring your burnt offerings, and your
        sacrifices, and your tithes, and heave offerings of your hand,
        and your vows, and your freewill offerings, and the firstlings
        of your herds and of your flocks:

012:007 And there ye shall eat before the LORD your God, and ye shall
        rejoice in all that ye put your hand unto, ye and your
        households, wherein the LORD thy God hath blessed thee.

012:008 Ye shall not do after all the things that we do here this day,
        every man whatsoever is right in his own eyes.

012:009 For ye are not as yet come to the rest and to the inheritance,
        which the LORD your God giveth you.

012:010 But when ye go over Jordan, and dwell in the land which the
        LORD your God giveth you to inherit, and when he giveth you
        rest from all your enemies round about, so that ye dwell in
        safety;

012:011 Then there shall be a place which the LORD your God shall
        choose to cause his name to dwell there; thither shall ye
        bring all that I command you; your burnt offerings, and your
        sacrifices, your tithes, and the heave offering of your hand,
        and all your choice vows which ye vow unto the LORD:

012:012 And ye shall rejoice before the LORD your God, ye, and your
        sons, and your daughters, and your menservants, and your
        maidservants, and the Levite that is within your gates;
        forasmuch as he hath no part nor inheritance with you.

012:013 Take heed to thyself that thou offer not thy burnt offerings
        in every place that thou seest:

012:014 But in the place which the LORD shall choose in one of thy
        tribes, there thou shalt offer thy burnt offerings, and there
        thou shalt do all that I command thee.

012:015 Notwithstanding thou mayest kill and eat flesh in all thy
        gates, whatsoever thy soul lusteth after, according to the
        blessing of the LORD thy God which he hath given thee: the
        unclean and the clean may eat thereof, as of the roebuck, and
        as of the hart.

012:016 Only ye shall not eat the blood; ye shall pour it upon the
        earth as water.

012:017 Thou mayest not eat within thy gates the tithe of thy corn, or
        of thy wine, or of thy oil, or the firstlings of thy herds or
        of thy flock, nor any of thy vows which thou vowest, nor thy
        freewill offerings, or heave offering of thine hand:

012:018 But thou must eat them before the LORD thy God in the place
        which the LORD thy God shall choose, thou, and thy son, and
        thy daughter, and thy manservant, and thy maidservant, and the
        Levite that is within thy gates: and thou shalt rejoice before
        the LORD thy God in all that thou puttest thine hands unto.

012:019 Take heed to thyself that thou forsake not the Levite as long
        as thou livest upon the earth.

012:020 When the LORD thy God shall enlarge thy border, as he hath
        promised thee, and thou shalt say, I will eat flesh, because
        thy soul longeth to eat flesh; thou mayest eat flesh,
        whatsoever thy soul lusteth after.

012:021 If the place which the LORD thy God hath chosen to put his
        name there be too far from thee, then thou shalt kill of thy
        herd and of thy flock, which the LORD hath given thee, as I
        have commanded thee, and thou shalt eat in thy gates
        whatsoever thy soul lusteth after.

012:022 Even as the roebuck and the hart is eaten, so thou shalt eat
        them: the unclean and the clean shall eat of them alike.

012:023 Only be sure that thou eat not the blood: for the blood is the
        life; and thou mayest not eat the life with the flesh.

012:024 Thou shalt not eat it; thou shalt pour it upon the earth as
        water.

012:025 Thou shalt not eat it; that it may go well with thee, and with
        thy children after thee, when thou shalt do that which is
        right in the sight of the LORD.

012:026 Only thy holy things which thou hast, and thy vows, thou shalt
        take, and go unto the place which the LORD shall choose:

012:027 And thou shalt offer thy burnt offerings, the flesh and the
        blood, upon the altar of the LORD thy God: and the blood of
        thy sacrifices shall be poured out upon the altar of the LORD
        thy God, and thou shalt eat the flesh.

012:028 Observe and hear all these words which I command thee, that it
        may go well with thee, and with thy children after thee for
        ever, when thou doest that which is good and right in the
        sight of the LORD thy God.

012:029 When the LORD thy God shall cut off the nations from before
        thee, whither thou goest to possess them, and thou succeedest
        them, and dwellest in their land;

012:030 Take heed to thyself that thou be not snared by following
        them, after that they be destroyed from before thee; and that
        thou enquire not after their gods, saying, How did these
        nations serve their gods? even so will I do likewise.

012:031 Thou shalt not do so unto the LORD thy God: for every
        abomination to the LORD, which he hateth, have they done unto
        their gods; for even their sons and their daughters they have
        burnt in the fire to their gods.

012:032 What thing soever I command you, observe to do it: thou shalt
        not add thereto, nor diminish from it.

013:001 If there arise among you a prophet, or a dreamer of dreams,
        and giveth thee a sign or a wonder,

013:002 And the sign or the wonder come to pass, whereof he spake unto
        thee, saying, Let us go after other gods, which thou hast not
        known, and let us serve them;

013:003 Thou shalt not hearken unto the words of that prophet, or that
        dreamer of dreams: for the LORD your God proveth you, to know
        whether ye love the LORD your God with all your heart and with
        all your soul.

013:004 Ye shall walk after the LORD your God, and fear him, and keep
        his commandments, and obey his voice, and ye shall serve him,
        and cleave unto him.

013:005 And that prophet, or that dreamer of dreams, shall be put to
        death; because he hath spoken to turn you away from the LORD
        your God, which brought you out of the land of Egypt, and
        redeemed you out of the house of bondage, to thrust thee out
        of the way which the LORD thy God commanded thee to walk in.
        So shalt thou put the evil away from the midst of thee.

013:006 If thy brother, the son of thy mother, or thy son, or thy
        daughter, or the wife of thy bosom, or thy friend, which is as
        thine own soul, entice thee secretly, saying, Let us go and
        serve other gods, which thou hast not known, thou, nor thy
        fathers;

013:007 Namely, of the gods of the people which are round about you,
        nigh unto thee, or far off from thee, from the one end of the
        earth even unto the other end of the earth;

013:008 Thou shalt not consent unto him, nor hearken unto him; neither
        shall thine eye pity him, neither shalt thou spare, neither
        shalt thou conceal him:

013:009 But thou shalt surely kill him; thine hand shall be first upon
        him to put him to death, and afterwards the hand of all the
        people.

013:010 And thou shalt stone him with stones, that he die; because he
        hath sought to thrust thee away from the LORD thy God, which
        brought thee out of the land of Egypt, from the house of
        bondage.

013:011 And all Israel shall hear, and fear, and shall do no more any
        such wickedness as this is among you.

013:012 If thou shalt hear say in one of thy cities, which the LORD
        thy God hath given thee to dwell there, saying,

013:013 Certain men, the children of Belial, are gone out from among
        you, and have withdrawn the inhabitants of their city, saying,
        Let us go and serve other gods, which ye have not known;

013:014 Then shalt thou enquire, and make search, and ask diligently;
        and, behold, if it be truth, and the thing certain, that such
        abomination is wrought among you;

013:015 Thou shalt surely smite the inhabitants of that city with the
        edge of the sword, destroying it utterly, and all that is
        therein, and the cattle thereof, with the edge of the sword.

013:016 And thou shalt gather all the spoil of it into the midst of
        the street thereof, and shalt burn with fire the city, and all
        the spoil thereof every whit, for the LORD thy God: and it
        shall be an heap for ever; it shall not be built again.

013:017 And there shall cleave nought of the cursed thing to thine
        hand: that the LORD may turn from the fierceness of his anger,
        and shew thee mercy, and have compassion upon thee, and
        multiply thee, as he hath sworn unto thy fathers;

013:018 When thou shalt hearken to the voice of the LORD thy God, to
        keep all his commandments which I command thee this day, to do
        that which is right in the eyes of the LORD thy God.

014:001 Ye are the children of the LORD your God: ye shall not cut
        yourselves, nor make any baldness between your eyes for the
        dead.

014:002 For thou art an holy people unto the LORD thy God, and the
        LORD hath chosen thee to be a peculiar people unto himself,
        above all the nations that are upon the earth.

014:003 Thou shalt not eat any abominable thing.

014:004 These are the beasts which ye shall eat: the ox, the sheep,
        and the goat,

014:005 The hart, and the roebuck, and the fallow deer, and the wild
        goat, and the pygarg, and the wild ox, and the chamois.

014:006 And every beast that parteth the hoof, and cleaveth the cleft
        into two claws, and cheweth the cud among the beasts, that ye
        shall eat.

014:007 Nevertheless these ye shall not eat of them that chew the cud,
        or of them that divide the cloven hoof; as the camel, and the
        hare, and the coney: for they chew the cud, but divide not the
        hoof; therefore they are unclean unto you.

014:008 And the swine, because it divideth the hoof, yet cheweth not
        the cud, it is unclean unto you: ye shall not eat of their
        flesh, nor touch their dead carcase.

014:009 These ye shall eat of all that are in the waters: all that
        have fins and scales shall ye eat:

014:010 And whatsoever hath not fins and scales ye may not eat; it is
        unclean unto you.

014:011 Of all clean birds ye shall eat.

014:012 But these are they of which ye shall not eat: the eagle, and
        the ossifrage, and the ospray,

014:013 And the glede, and the kite, and the vulture after his kind,

014:014 And every raven after his kind,

014:015 And the owl, and the night hawk, and the cuckow, and the hawk
        after his kind,

014:016 The little owl, and the great owl, and the swan,

014:017 And the pelican, and the gier eagle, and the cormorant,

014:018 And the stork, and the heron after her kind, and the lapwing,
        and the bat.

014:019 And every creeping thing that flieth is unclean unto you: they
        shall not be eaten.

014:020 But of all clean fowls ye may eat.

014:021 Ye shall not eat of anything that dieth of itself: thou shalt
        give it unto the stranger that is in thy gates, that he may
        eat it; or thou mayest sell it unto an alien: for thou art an
        holy people unto the LORD thy God. Thou shalt not seethe a kid
        in his mother's milk.

014:022 Thou shalt truly tithe all the increase of thy seed, that the
        field bringeth forth year by year.

014:023 And thou shalt eat before the LORD thy God, in the place which
        he shall choose to place his name there, the tithe of thy
        corn, of thy wine, and of thine oil, and the firstlings of thy
        herds and of thy flocks; that thou mayest learn to fear the
        LORD thy God always.

014:024 And if the way be too long for thee, so that thou art not able
        to carry it; or if the place be too far from thee, which the
        LORD thy God shall choose to set his name there, when the LORD
        thy God hath blessed thee:

014:025 Then shalt thou turn it into money, and bind up the money in
        thine hand, and shalt go unto the place which the LORD thy God
        shall choose:

014:026 And thou shalt bestow that money for whatsoever thy soul
        lusteth after, for oxen, or for sheep, or for wine, or for
        strong drink, or for whatsoever thy soul desireth: and thou
        shalt eat there before the LORD thy God, and thou shalt
        rejoice, thou, and thine household,

014:027 And the Levite that is within thy gates; thou shalt not
        forsake him; for he hath no part nor inheritance with thee.

014:028 At the end of three years thou shalt bring forth all the tithe
        of thine increase the same year, and shalt lay it up within
        thy gates:

014:029 And the Levite, (because he hath no part nor inheritance with
        thee,) and the stranger, and the fatherless, and the widow,
        which are within thy gates, shall come, and shall eat and be
        satisfied; that the LORD thy God may bless thee in all the
        work of thine hand which thou doest.

015:001 At the end of every seven years thou shalt make a release.

015:002 And this is the manner of the release: Every creditor that
        lendeth ought unto his neighbour shall release it; he shall
        not exact it of his neighbour, or of his brother; because it
        is called the LORD's release.

015:003 Of a foreigner thou mayest exact it again: but that which is
        thine with thy brother thine hand shall release;

015:004 Save when there shall be no poor among you; for the LORD shall
        greatly bless thee in the land which the LORD thy God giveth
        thee for an inheritance to possess it:

015:005 Only if thou carefully hearken unto the voice of the LORD thy
        God, to observe to do all these commandments which I command
        thee this day.

015:006 For the LORD thy God blesseth thee, as he promised thee: and
        thou shalt lend unto many nations, but thou shalt not borrow;
        and thou shalt reign over many nations, but they shall not
        reign over thee.

015:007 If there be among you a poor man of one of thy brethren within
        any of thy gates in thy land which the LORD thy God giveth
        thee, thou shalt not harden thine heart, nor shut thine hand
        from thy poor brother:

015:008 But thou shalt open thine hand wide unto him, and shalt surely
        lend him sufficient for his need, in that which he wanteth.

015:009 Beware that there be not a thought in thy wicked heart,
        saying, The seventh year, the year of release, is at hand; and
        thine eye be evil against thy poor brother, and thou givest
        him nought; and he cry unto the LORD against thee, and it be
        sin unto thee.

015:010 Thou shalt surely give him, and thine heart shall not be
        grieved when thou givest unto him: because that for this thing
        the LORD thy God shall bless thee in all thy works, and in all
        that thou puttest thine hand unto.

015:011 For the poor shall never cease out of the land: therefore I
        command thee, saying, Thou shalt open thine hand wide unto thy
        brother, to thy poor, and to thy needy, in thy land.

015:012 And if thy brother, an Hebrew man, or an Hebrew woman, be sold
        unto thee, and serve thee six years; then in the seventh year
        thou shalt let him go free from thee.

015:013 And when thou sendest him out free from thee, thou shalt not
        let him go away empty:

015:014 Thou shalt furnish him liberally out of thy flock, and out of
        thy floor, and out of thy winepress: of that wherewith the
        LORD thy God hath blessed thee thou shalt give unto him.

015:015 And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in the land
        of Egypt, and the LORD thy God redeemed thee: therefore I
        command thee this thing to day.

015:016 And it shall be, if he say unto thee, I will not go away from
        thee; because he loveth thee and thine house, because he is
        well with thee;

015:017 Then thou shalt take an aul, and thrust it through his ear
        unto the door, and he shall be thy servant for ever. And also
        unto thy maidservant thou shalt do likewise.

015:018 It shall not seem hard unto thee, when thou sendest him away
        free from thee; for he hath been worth a double hired servant
        to thee, in serving thee six years: and the LORD thy God shall
        bless thee in all that thou doest.

015:019 All the firstling males that come of thy herd and of thy flock
        thou shalt sanctify unto the LORD thy God: thou shalt do no
        work with the firstling of thy bullock, nor shear the
        firstling of thy sheep.

015:020 Thou shalt eat it before the LORD thy God year by year in the
        place which the LORD shall choose, thou and thy household.

015:021 And if there be any blemish therein, as if it be lame, or
        blind, or have any ill blemish, thou shalt not sacrifice it
        unto the LORD thy God.

015:022 Thou shalt eat it within thy gates: the unclean and the clean
        person shall eat it alike, as the roebuck, and as the hart.

015:023 Only thou shalt not eat the blood thereof; thou shalt pour it
        upon the ground as water.

016:001 Observe the month of Abib, and keep the passover unto the LORD
        thy God: for in the month of Abib the LORD thy God brought
        thee forth out of Egypt by night.

016:002 Thou shalt therefore sacrifice the passover unto the LORD thy
        God, of the flock and the herd, in the place which the LORD
        shall choose to place his name there.

016:003 Thou shalt eat no leavened bread with it; seven days shalt
        thou eat unleavened bread therewith, even the bread of
        affliction; for thou camest forth out of the land of Egypt in
        haste: that thou mayest remember the day when thou camest
        forth out of the land of Egypt all the days of thy life.

016:004 And there shall be no leavened bread seen with thee in all thy
        coast seven days; neither shall there any thing of the flesh,
        which thou sacrificedst the first day at even, remain all
        night until the morning.

016:005 Thou mayest not sacrifice the passover within any of thy
        gates, which the LORD thy God giveth thee:

016:006 But at the place which the LORD thy God shall choose to place
        his name in, there thou shalt sacrifice the passover at even,
        at the going down of the sun, at the season that thou camest
        forth out of Egypt.

016:007 And thou shalt roast and eat it in the place which the LORD
        thy God shall choose: and thou shalt turn in the morning, and
        go unto thy tents.

016:008 Six days thou shalt eat unleavened bread: and on the seventh
        day shall be a solemn assembly to the LORD thy God: thou shalt
        do no work therein.

016:009 Seven weeks shalt thou number unto thee: begin to number the
        seven weeks from such time as thou beginnest to put the sickle
        to the corn.

016:010 And thou shalt keep the feast of weeks unto the LORD thy God
        with a tribute of a freewill offering of thine hand, which
        thou shalt give unto the LORD thy God, according as the LORD
        thy God hath blessed thee:

016:011 And thou shalt rejoice before the LORD thy God, thou, and thy
        son, and thy daughter, and thy manservant, and thy
        maidservant, and the Levite that is within thy gates, and the
        stranger, and the fatherless, and the widow, that are among
        you, in the place which the LORD thy God hath chosen to place
        his name there.

016:012 And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in Egypt: and
        thou shalt observe and do these statutes.

016:013 Thou shalt observe the feast of tabernacles seven days, after
        that thou hast gathered in thy corn and thy wine:

016:014 And thou shalt rejoice in thy feast, thou, and thy son, and
        thy daughter, and thy manservant, and thy maidservant, and the
        Levite, the stranger, and the fatherless, and the widow, that
        are within thy gates.

016:015 Seven days shalt thou keep a solemn feast unto the LORD thy
        God in the place which the LORD shall choose: because the LORD
        thy God shall bless thee in all thine increase, and in all the
        works of thine hands, therefore thou shalt surely rejoice.

016:016 Three times in a year shall all thy males appear before the
        LORD thy God in the place which he shall choose; in the feast
        of unleavened bread, and in the feast of weeks, and in the
        feast of tabernacles: and they shall not appear before the
        LORD empty:

016:017 Every man shall give as he is able, according to the blessing
        of the LORD thy God which he hath given thee.

016:018 Judges and officers shalt thou make thee in all thy gates,
        which the LORD thy God giveth thee, throughout thy tribes: and
        they shall judge the people with just judgment.

016:019 Thou shalt not wrest judgment; thou shalt not respect persons,
        neither take a gift: for a gift doth blind the eyes of the
        wise, and pervert the words of the righteous.

016:020 That which is altogether just shalt thou follow, that thou
        mayest live, and inherit the land which the LORD thy God
        giveth thee.

016:021 Thou shalt not plant thee a grove of any trees near unto the
        altar of the LORD thy God, which thou shalt make thee.

016:022 Neither shalt thou set thee up any image; which the LORD thy
        God hateth.

017:001 Thou shalt not sacrifice unto the LORD thy God any bullock, or
        sheep, wherein is blemish, or any evilfavouredness: for that
        is an abomination unto the LORD thy God.

017:002 If there be found among you, within any of thy gates which the
        LORD thy God giveth thee, man or woman, that hath wrought
        wickedness in the sight of the LORD thy God, in transgressing
        his covenant,

017:003 And hath gone and served other gods, and worshipped them,
        either the sun, or moon, or any of the host of heaven, which I
        have not commanded;

017:004 And it be told thee, and thou hast heard of it, and enquired
        diligently, and, behold, it be true, and the thing certain,
        that such abomination is wrought in Israel:

017:005 Then shalt thou bring forth that man or that woman, which have
        committed that wicked thing, unto thy gates, even that man or
        that woman, and shalt stone them with stones, till they die.

017:006 At the mouth of two witnesses, or three witnesses, shall he
        that is worthy of death be put to death; but at the mouth of
        one witness he shall not be put to death.

017:007 The hands of the witnesses shall be first upon him to put him
        to death, and afterward the hands of all the people. So thou
        shalt put the evil away from among you.

017:008 If there arise a matter too hard for thee in judgment, between
        blood and blood, between plea and plea, and between stroke and
        stroke, being matters of controversy within thy gates: then
        shalt thou arise, and get thee up into the place which the
        LORD thy God shall choose;

017:009 And thou shalt come unto the priests the Levites, and unto the
        judge that shall be in those days, and enquire; and they shall
        shew thee the sentence of judgment:

017:010 And thou shalt do according to the sentence, which they of
        that place which the LORD shall choose shall shew thee; and
        thou shalt observe to do according to all that they inform
        thee:

017:011 According to the sentence of the law which they shall teach
        thee, and according to the judgment which they shall tell
        thee, thou shalt do: thou shalt not decline from the sentence
        which they shall shew thee, to the right hand, nor to the
        left.

017:012 And the man that will do presumptuously, and will not hearken
        unto the priest that standeth to minister there before the
        LORD thy God, or unto the judge, even that man shall die: and
        thou shalt put away the evil from Israel.

017:013 And all the people shall hear, and fear, and do no more
        presumptuously.

017:014 When thou art come unto the land which the LORD thy God giveth
        thee, and shalt possess it, and shalt dwell therein, and shalt
        say, I will set a king over me, like as all the nations that
        are about me;

017:015 Thou shalt in any wise set him king over thee, whom the LORD
        thy God shall choose: one from among thy brethren shalt thou
        set king over thee: thou mayest not set a stranger over thee,
        which is not thy brother.

017:016 But he shall not multiply horses to himself, nor cause the
        people to return to Egypt, to the end that he should multiply
        horses: forasmuch as the LORD hath said unto you, Ye shall
        henceforth return no more that way.

017:017 Neither shall he multiply wives to himself, that his heart
        turn not away: neither shall he greatly multiply to himself
        silver and gold.

017:018 And it shall be, when he sitteth upon the throne of his
        kingdom, that he shall write him a copy of this law in a book
        out of that which is before the priests the Levites:

017:019 And it shall be with him, and he shall read therein all the
        days of his life: that he may learn to fear the LORD his God,
        to keep all the words of this law and these statutes, to do
        them:

017:020 That his heart be not lifted up above his brethren, and that
        he turn not aside from the commandment, to the right hand, or
        to the left: to the end that he may prolong his days in his
        kingdom, he, and his children, in the midst of Israel.

018:001 The priests the Levites, and all the tribe of Levi, shall have
        no part nor inheritance with Israel: they shall eat the
        offerings of the LORD made by fire, and his inheritance.

018:002 Therefore shall they have no inheritance among their brethren:
        the LORD is their inheritance, as he hath said unto them.

018:003 And this shall be the priest's due from the people, from them
        that offer a sacrifice, whether it be ox or sheep; and they
        shall give unto the priest the shoulder, and the two cheeks,
        and the maw.

018:004 The firstfruit also of thy corn, of thy wine, and of thine
        oil, and the first of the fleece of thy sheep, shalt thou give
        him.

018:005 For the LORD thy God hath chosen him out of all thy tribes, to
        stand to minister in the name of the LORD, him and his sons
        for ever.

018:006 And if a Levite come from any of thy gates out of all Israel,
        where he sojourned, and come with all the desire of his mind
        unto the place which the LORD shall choose;

018:007 Then he shall minister in the name of the LORD his God, as all
        his brethren the Levites do, which stand there before the
        LORD.

018:008 They shall have like portions to eat, beside that which cometh
        of the sale of his patrimony.

018:009 When thou art come into the land which the LORD thy God giveth
        thee, thou shalt not learn to do after the abominations of
        those nations.

018:010 There shall not be found among you any one that maketh his son
        or his daughter to pass through the fire, or that useth
        divination, or an observer of times, or an enchanter, or a
        witch.

018:011 Or a charmer, or a consulter with familiar spirits, or a
        wizard, or a necromancer.

018:012 For all that do these things are an abomination unto the LORD:
        and because of these abominations the LORD thy God doth drive
        them out from before thee.

018:013 Thou shalt be perfect with the LORD thy God.

018:014 For these nations, which thou shalt possess, hearkened unto
        observers of times, and unto diviners: but as for thee, the
        LORD thy God hath not suffered thee so to do.

018:015 The LORD thy God will raise up unto thee a Prophet from the
        midst of thee, of thy brethren, like unto me; unto him ye
        shall hearken;

018:016 According to all that thou desiredst of the LORD thy God in
        Horeb in the day of the assembly, saying, Let me not hear
        again the voice of the LORD my God, neither let me see this
        great fire any more, that I die not.

018:017 And the LORD said unto me, They have well spoken that which
        they have spoken.

018:018 I will raise them up a Prophet from among their brethren, like
        unto thee, and will put my words in his mouth; and he shall
        speak unto them all that I shall command him.

018:019 And it shall come to pass, that whosoever will not hearken
        unto my words which he shall speak in my name, I will require
        it of him.

018:020 But the prophet, which shall presume to speak a word in my
        name, which I have not commanded him to speak, or that shall
        speak in the name of other gods, even that prophet shall die.

018:021 And if thou say in thine heart, How shall we know the word
        which the LORD hath not spoken?

018:022 When a prophet speaketh in the name of the LORD, if the thing
        follow not, nor come to pass, that is the thing which the LORD
        hath not spoken, but the prophet hath spoken it
        presumptuously: thou shalt not be afraid of him.

019:001 When the LORD thy God hath cut off the nations, whose land the
        LORD thy God giveth thee, and thou succeedest them, and
        dwellest in their cities, and in their houses;

019:002 Thou shalt separate three cities for thee in the midst of thy
        land, which the LORD thy God giveth thee to possess it.

019:003 Thou shalt prepare thee a way, and divide the coasts of thy
        land, which the LORD thy God giveth thee to inherit, into
        three parts, that every slayer may flee thither.

019:004 And this is the case of the slayer, which shall flee thither,
        that he may live: Whoso killeth his neighbour ignorantly, whom
        he hated not in time past;

019:005 As when a man goeth into the wood with his neighbour to hew
        wood, and his hand fetcheth a stroke with the axe to cut down
        the tree, and the head slippeth from the helve, and lighteth
        upon his neighbour, that he die; he shall flee unto one of
        those cities, and live:

019:006 Lest the avenger of the blood pursue the slayer, while his
        heart is hot, and overtake him, because the way is long, and
        slay him; whereas he was not worthy of death, inasmuch as he
        hated him not in time past.

019:007 Wherefore I command thee, saying, Thou shalt separate three
        cities for thee.

019:008 And if the LORD thy God enlarge thy coast, as he hath sworn
        unto thy fathers, and give thee all the land which he promised
        to give unto thy fathers;

019:009 If thou shalt keep all these commandments to do them, which I
        command thee this day, to love the LORD thy God, and to walk
        ever in his ways; then shalt thou add three cities more for
        thee, beside these three:

019:010 That innocent blood be not shed in thy land, which the LORD
        thy God giveth thee for an inheritance, and so blood be upon
        thee.

019:011 But if any man hate his neighbour, and lie in wait for him,
        and rise up against him, and smite him mortally that he die,
        and fleeth into one of these cities:

019:012 Then the elders of his city shall send and fetch him thence,
        and deliver him into the hand of the avenger of blood, that he
        may die.

019:013 Thine eye shall not pity him, but thou shalt put away the
        guilt of innocent blood from Israel, that it may go well with
        thee.

019:014 Thou shalt not remove thy neighbour's landmark, which they of
        old time have set in thine inheritance, which thou shalt
        inherit in the land that the LORD thy God giveth thee to
        possess it.

019:015 One witness shall not rise up against a man for any iniquity,
        or for any sin, in any sin that he sinneth: at the mouth of
        two witnesses, or at the mouth of three witnesses, shall the
        matter be established.

019:016 If a false witness rise up against any man to testify against
        him that which is wrong;

019:017 Then both the men, between whom the controversy is, shall
        stand before the LORD, before the priests and the judges,
        which shall be in those days;

019:018 And the judges shall make diligent inquisition: and, behold,
        if the witness be a false witness, and hath testified falsely
        against his brother;

019:019 Then shall ye do unto him, as he had thought to have done unto
        his brother: so shalt thou put the evil away from among you.

019:020 And those which remain shall hear, and fear, and shall
        henceforth commit no more any such evil among you.

019:021 And thine eye shall not pity; but life shall go for life, eye
        for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot.

020:001 When thou goest out to battle against thine enemies, and seest
        horses, and chariots, and a people more than thou, be not
        afraid of them: for the LORD thy God is with thee, which
        brought thee up out of the land of Egypt.

020:002 And it shall be, when ye are come nigh unto the battle, that
        the priest shall approach and speak unto the people,

020:003 And shall say unto them, Hear, O Israel, ye approach this day
        unto battle against your enemies: let not your hearts faint,
        fear not, and do not tremble, neither be ye terrified because
        of them;

020:004 For the LORD your God is he that goeth with you, to fight for
        you against your enemies, to save you.

020:005 And the officers shall speak unto the people, saying, What man
        is there that hath built a new house, and hath not dedicated
        it? let him go and return to his house, lest he die in the
        battle, and another man dedicate it.

020:006 And what man is he that hath planted a vineyard, and hath not
        yet eaten of it? let him also go and return unto his house,
        lest he die in the battle, and another man eat of it.

020:007 And what man is there that hath betrothed a wife, and hath not
        taken her? let him go and return unto his house, lest he die
        in the battle, and another man take her.

020:008 And the officers shall speak further unto the people, and they
        shall say, What man is there that is fearful and fainthearted?
        let him go and return unto his house, lest his brethren's
        heart faint as well as his heart.

020:009 And it shall be, when the officers have made an end of
        speaking unto the people that they shall make captains of the
        armies to lead the people.

020:010 When thou comest nigh unto a city to fight against it, then
        proclaim peace unto it.

020:011 And it shall be, if it make thee answer of peace, and open
        unto thee, then it shall be, that all the people that is found
        therein shall be tributaries unto thee, and they shall serve
        thee.

020:012 And if it will make no peace with thee, but will make war
        against thee, then thou shalt besiege it:

020:013 And when the LORD thy God hath delivered it into thine hands,
        thou shalt smite every male thereof with the edge of the
        sword:

020:014 But the women, and the little ones, and the cattle, and all
        that is in the city, even all the spoil thereof, shalt thou
        take unto thyself; and thou shalt eat the spoil of thine
        enemies, which the LORD thy God hath given thee.

020:015 Thus shalt thou do unto all the cities which are very far off
        from thee, which are not of the cities of these nations.

020:016 But of the cities of these people, which the LORD thy God doth
        give thee for an inheritance, thou shalt save alive nothing
        that breatheth:

020:017 But thou shalt utterly destroy them; namely, the Hittites, and
        the Amorites, the Canaanites, and the Perizzites, the Hivites,
        and the Jebusites; as the LORD thy God hath commanded thee:

020:018 That they teach you not to do after all their abominations,
        which they have done unto their gods; so should ye sin against
        the LORD your God.

020:019 When thou shalt besiege a city a long time, in making war
        against it to take it, thou shalt not destroy the trees
        thereof by forcing an axe against them: for thou mayest eat of
        them, and thou shalt not cut them down (for the tree of the
        field is man's life) to employ them in the siege:

020:020 Only the trees which thou knowest that they be not trees for
        meat, thou shalt destroy and cut them down; and thou shalt
        build bulwarks against the city that maketh war with thee,
        until it be subdued.

021:001 If one be found slain in the land which the LORD thy God
        giveth thee to possess it, lying in the field, and it be not
        known who hath slain him:

021:002 Then thy elders and thy judges shall come forth, and they
        shall measure unto the cities which are round about him that
        is slain:

021:003 And it shall be, that the city which is next unto the slain
        man, even the elders of that city shall take an heifer, which
        hath not been wrought with, and which hath not drawn in the
        yoke;

021:004 And the elders of that city shall bring down the heifer unto a
        rough valley, which is neither eared nor sown, and shall
        strike off the heifer's neck there in the valley:

021:005 And the priests the sons of Levi shall come near; for them the
        LORD thy God hath chosen to minister unto him, and to bless in
        the name of the LORD; and by their word shall every
        controversy and every stroke be tried:

021:006 And all the elders of that city, that are next unto the slain
        man, shall wash their hands over the heifer that is beheaded
        in the valley:

021:007 And they shall answer and say, Our hands have not shed this
        blood, neither have our eyes seen it.

021:008 Be merciful, O LORD, unto thy people Israel, whom thou hast
        redeemed, and lay not innocent blood unto thy people of
        Israel's charge. And the blood shall be forgiven them.

021:009 So shalt thou put away the guilt of innocent blood from among
        you, when thou shalt do that which is right in the sight of
        the LORD.

021:010 When thou goest forth to war against thine enemies, and the
        LORD thy God hath delivered them into thine hands, and thou
        hast taken them captive,

021:011 And seest among the captives a beautiful woman, and hast a
        desire unto her, that thou wouldest have her to thy wife;

021:012 Then thou shalt bring her home to thine house, and she shall
        shave her head, and pare her nails;

021:013 And she shall put the raiment of her captivity from off her,
        and shall remain in thine house, and bewail her father and her
        mother a full month: and after that thou shalt go in unto her,
        and be her husband, and she shall be thy wife.

021:014 And it shall be, if thou have no delight in her, then thou
        shalt let her go whither she will; but thou shalt not sell her
        at all for money, thou shalt not make merchandise of her,
        because thou hast humbled her.

021:015 If a man have two wives, one beloved, and another hated, and
        they have born him children, both the beloved and the hated;
        and if the firstborn son be hers that was hated:

021:016 Then it shall be, when he maketh his sons to inherit that
        which he hath, that he may not make the son of the beloved
        firstborn before the son of the hated, which is indeed the
        firstborn:

021:017 But he shall acknowledge the son of the hated for the
        firstborn, by giving him a double portion of all that he hath:
        for he is the beginning of his strength; the right of the
        firstborn is his.

021:018 If a man have a stubborn and rebellious son, which will not
        obey the voice of his father, or the voice of his mother, and
        that, when they have chastened him, will not hearken unto
        them:

021:019 Then shall his father and his mother lay hold on him, and
        bring him out unto the elders of his city, and unto the gate
        of his place;

021:020 And they shall say unto the elders of his city, This our son
        is stubborn and rebellious, he will not obey our voice; he is
        a glutton, and a drunkard.

021:021 And all the men of his city shall stone him with stones, that
        he die: so shalt thou put evil away from among you; and all
        Israel shall hear, and fear.

021:022 And if a man have committed a sin worthy of death, and he be
        to be put to death, and thou hang him on a tree:

021:023 His body shall not remain all night upon the tree, but thou
        shalt in any wise bury him that day; (for he that is hanged is
        accursed of God;) that thy land be not defiled, which the LORD
        thy God giveth thee for an inheritance.

022:001 Thou shalt not see thy brother's ox or his sheep go astray,
        and hide thyself from them: thou shalt in any case bring them
        again unto thy brother.

022:002 And if thy brother be not nigh unto thee, or if thou know him
        not, then thou shalt bring it unto thine own house, and it
        shall be with thee until thy brother seek after it, and thou
        shalt restore it to him again.

022:003 In like manner shalt thou do with his ass; and so shalt thou
        do with his raiment; and with all lost thing of thy brother's,
        which he hath lost, and thou hast found, shalt thou do
        likewise: thou mayest not hide thyself.

022:004 Thou shalt not see thy brother's ass or his ox fall down by
        the way, and hide thyself from them: thou shalt surely help
        him to lift them up again.

022:005 The woman shall not wear that which pertaineth unto a man,
        neither shall a man put on a woman's garment: for all that do
        so are abomination unto the LORD thy God.

022:006 If a bird's nest chance to be before thee in the way in any
        tree, or on the ground, whether they be young ones, or eggs,
        and the dam sitting upon the young, or upon the eggs, thou
        shalt not take the dam with the young:

022:007 But thou shalt in any wise let the dam go, and take the young
        to thee; that it may be well with thee, and that thou mayest
        prolong thy days.

022:008 When thou buildest a new house, then thou shalt make a
        battlement for thy roof, that thou bring not blood upon thine
        house, if any man fall from thence.

022:009 Thou shalt not sow thy vineyard with divers seeds: lest the
        fruit of thy seed which thou hast sown, and the fruit of thy
        vineyard, be defiled.

022:010 Thou shalt not plow with an ox and an ass together.

022:011 Thou shalt not wear a garment of divers sorts, as of woollen
        and linen together.

022:012 Thou shalt make thee fringes upon the four quarters of thy
        vesture, wherewith thou coverest thyself.

022:013 If any man take a wife, and go in unto her, and hate her,

022:014 And give occasions of speech against her, and bring up an evil
        name upon her, and say, I took this woman, and when I came to
        her, I found her not a maid:

022:015 Then shall the father of the damsel, and her mother, take and
        bring forth the tokens of the damsel's virginity unto the
        elders of the city in the gate:

022:016 And the damsel's father shall say unto the elders, I gave my
        daughter unto this man to wife, and he hateth her;

022:017 And, lo, he hath given occasions of speech against her,
        saying, I found not thy daughter a maid; and yet these are the
        tokens of my daughter's virginity. And they shall spread the
        cloth before the elders of the city.

022:018 And the elders of that city shall take that man and chastise
        him;

022:019 And they shall amerce him in an hundred shekels of silver, and
        give them unto the father of the damsel, because he hath
        brought up an evil name upon a virgin of Israel: and she shall
        be his wife; he may not put her away all his days.

022:020 But if this thing be true, and the tokens of virginity be not
        found for the damsel:

022:021 Then they shall bring out the damsel to the door of her
        father's house, and the men of her city shall stone her with
        stones that she die: because she hath wrought folly in Israel,
        to play the whore in her father's house: so shalt thou put
        evil away from among you.

022:022 If a man be found lying with a woman married to an husband,
        then they shall both of them die, both the man that lay with
        the woman, and the woman: so shalt thou put away evil from
        Israel.

022:023 If a damsel that is a virgin be betrothed unto an husband, and
        a man find her in the city, and lie with her;

022:024 Then ye shall bring them both out unto the gate of that city,
        and ye shall stone them with stones that they die; the damsel,
        because she cried not, being in the city; and the man, because
        he hath humbled his neighbour's wife: so thou shalt put away
        evil from among you.

022:025 But if a man find a betrothed damsel in the field, and the man
        force her, and lie with her: then the man only that lay with
        her shall die.

022:026 But unto the damsel thou shalt do nothing; there is in the
        damsel no sin worthy of death: for as when a man riseth
        against his neighbour, and slayeth him, even so is this
        matter:

022:027 For he found her in the field, and the betrothed damsel cried,
        and there was none to save her.

022:028 If a man find a damsel that is a virgin, which is not
        betrothed, and lay hold on her, and lie with her, and they be
        found;

022:029 Then the man that lay with her shall give unto the damsel's
        father fifty shekels of silver, and she shall be his wife;
        because he hath humbled her, he may not put her away all his
        days.

022:030 A man shall not take his father's wife, nor discover his
        father's skirt.

023:001 He that is wounded in the stones, or hath his privy member cut
        off, shall not enter into the congregation of the LORD.

023:002 A bastard shall not enter into the congregation of the LORD;
        even to his tenth generation shall he not enter into the
        congregation of the LORD.

023:003 An Ammonite or Moabite shall not enter into the congregation
        of the LORD; even to their tenth generation shall they not
        enter into the congregation of the LORD for ever:

023:004 Because they met you not with bread and with water in the way,
        when ye came forth out of Egypt; and because they hired
        against thee Balaam the son of Beor of Pethor of Mesopotamia,
        to curse thee.

023:005 Nevertheless the LORD thy God would not hearken unto Balaam;
        but the LORD thy God turned the curse into a blessing unto
        thee, because the LORD thy God loved thee.

023:006 Thou shalt not seek their peace nor their prosperity all thy
        days for ever.

023:007 Thou shalt not abhor an Edomite; for he is thy brother: thou
        shalt not abhor an Egyptian; because thou wast a stranger in
        his land.

023:008 The children that are begotten of them shall enter into the
        congregation of the LORD in their third generation.

023:009 When the host goeth forth against thine enemies, then keep
        thee from every wicked thing.

023:010 If there be among you any man, that is not clean by reason of
        uncleanness that chanceth him by night, then shall he go
        abroad out of the camp, he shall not come within the camp:

023:011 But it shall be, when evening cometh on, he shall wash himself
        with water: and when the sun is down, he shall come into the
        camp again.

023:012 Thou shalt have a place also without the camp, whither thou
        shalt go forth abroad:

023:013 And thou shalt have a paddle upon thy weapon; and it shall be,
        when thou wilt ease thyself abroad, thou shalt dig therewith,
        and shalt turn back and cover that which cometh from thee:

023:014 For the LORD thy God walketh in the midst of thy camp, to
        deliver thee, and to give up thine enemies before thee;
        therefore shall thy camp be holy: that he see no unclean thing
        in thee, and turn away from thee.

023:015 Thou shalt not deliver unto his master the servant which is
        escaped from his master unto thee:

023:016 He shall dwell with thee, even among you, in that place which
        he shall choose in one of thy gates, where it liketh him best:
        thou shalt not oppress him.

023:017 There shall be no whore of the daughters of Israel, nor a
        sodomite of the sons of Israel.

023:018 Thou shalt not bring the hire of a whore, or the price of a
        dog, into the house of the LORD thy God for any vow: for even
        both these are abomination unto the LORD thy God.

023:019 Thou shalt not lend upon usury to thy brother; usury of money,
        usury of victuals, usury of any thing that is lent upon usury:

023:020 Unto a stranger thou mayest lend upon usury; but unto thy
        brother thou shalt not lend upon usury: that the LORD thy God
        may bless thee in all that thou settest thine hand to in the
        land whither thou goest to possess it.

023:021 When thou shalt vow a vow unto the LORD thy God, thou shalt
        not slack to pay it: for the LORD thy God will surely require
        it of thee; and it would be sin in thee.

023:022 But if thou shalt forbear to vow, it shall be no sin in thee.

023:023 That which is gone out of thy lips thou shalt keep and
        perform; even a freewill offering, according as thou hast
        vowed unto the LORD thy God, which thou hast promised with thy
        mouth.

023:024 When thou comest into thy neighbour's vineyard, then thou
        mayest eat grapes thy fill at thine own pleasure; but thou
        shalt not put any in thy vessel.

023:025 When thou comest into the standing corn of thy neighbour, then
        thou mayest pluck the ears with thine hand; but thou shalt not
        move a sickle unto thy neighbour's standing corn.

024:001 When a man hath taken a wife, and married her, and it come to
        pass that she find no favour in his eyes, because he hath
        found some uncleanness in her: then let him write her a bill
        of divorcement, and give it in her hand, and send her out of
        his house.

024:002 And when she is departed out of his house, she may go and be
        another man's wife.

024:003 And if the latter husband hate her, and write her a bill of
        divorcement, and giveth it in her hand, and sendeth her out of
        his house; or if the latter husband die, which took her to be
        his wife;

024:004 Her former husband, which sent her away, may not take her
        again to be his wife, after that she is defiled; for that is
        abomination before the LORD: and thou shalt not cause the land
        to sin, which the LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance.

024:005 When a man hath taken a new wife, he shall not go out to war,
        neither shall he be charged with any business: but he shall be
        free at home one year, and shall cheer up his wife which he
        hath taken.

024:006 No man shall take the nether or the upper millstone to pledge:
        for he taketh a man's life to pledge.

024:007 If a man be found stealing any of his brethren of the children
        of Israel, and maketh merchandise of him, or selleth him; then
        that thief shall die; and thou shalt put evil away from among
        you.

024:008 Take heed in the plague of leprosy, that thou observe
        diligently, and do according to all that the priests the
        Levites shall teach you: as I commanded them, so ye shall
        observe to do.

024:009 Remember what the LORD thy God did unto Miriam by the way,
        after that ye were come forth out of Egypt.

024:010 When thou dost lend thy brother any thing, thou shalt not go
        into his house to fetch his pledge.

024:011 Thou shalt stand abroad, and the man to whom thou dost lend
        shall bring out the pledge abroad unto thee.

024:012 And if the man be poor, thou shalt not sleep with his pledge:

024:013 In any case thou shalt deliver him the pledge again when the
        sun goeth down, that he may sleep in his own raiment, and
        bless thee: and it shall be righteousness unto thee before the
        LORD thy God.

024:014 Thou shalt not oppress an hired servant that is poor and
        needy, whether he be of thy brethren, or of thy strangers that
        are in thy land within thy gates:

024:015 At his day thou shalt give him his hire, neither shall the sun
        go down upon it; for he is poor, and setteth his heart upon
        it: lest he cry against thee unto the LORD, and it be sin unto
        thee.

024:016 The fathers shall not be put to death for the children,
        neither shall the children be put to death for the fathers:
        every man shall be put to death for his own sin.

024:017 Thou shalt not pervert the judgment of the stranger, nor of
        the fatherless; nor take a widow's raiment to pledge:

024:018 But thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in Egypt, and
        the LORD thy God redeemed thee thence: therefore I command
        thee to do this thing.

024:019 When thou cuttest down thine harvest in thy field, and hast
        forgot a sheaf in the field, thou shalt not go again to fetch
        it: it shall be for the stranger, for the fatherless, and for
        the widow: that the LORD thy God may bless thee in all the
        work of thine hands.

024:020 When thou beatest thine olive tree, thou shalt not go over the
        boughs again: it shall be for the stranger, for the
        fatherless, and for the widow.

024:021 When thou gatherest the grapes of thy vineyard, thou shalt not
        glean it afterward: it shall be for the stranger, for the
        fatherless, and for the widow.

024:022 And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in the land
        of Egypt: therefore I command thee to do this thing.

025:001 If there be a controversy between men, and they come unto
        judgment, that the judges may judge them; then they shall
        justify the righteous, and condemn the wicked.

025:002 And it shall be, if the wicked man be worthy to be beaten,
        that the judge shall cause him to lie down, and to be beaten
        before his face, according to his fault, by a certain number.

025:003 Forty stripes he may give him, and not exceed: lest, if he
        should exceed, and beat him above these with many stripes,
        then thy brother should seem vile unto thee.

025:004 Thou shalt not muzzle the ox when he treadeth out the corn.

025:005 If brethren dwell together, and one of them die, and have no
        child, the wife of the dead shall not marry without unto a
        stranger: her husband's brother shall go in unto her, and take
        her to him to wife, and perform the duty of an husband's
        brother unto her.

025:006 And it shall be, that the firstborn which she beareth shall
        succeed in the name of his brother which is dead, that his
        name be not put out of Israel.

025:007 And if the man like not to take his brother's wife, then let
        his brother's wife go up to the gate unto the elders, and say,
        My husband's brother refuseth to raise up unto his brother a
        name in Israel, he will not perform the duty of my husband's
        brother.

025:008 Then the elders of his city shall call him, and speak unto
        him: and if he stand to it, and say, I like not to take her;

025:009 Then shall his brother's wife come unto him in the presence of
        the elders, and loose his shoe from off his foot, and spit in
        his face, and shall answer and say, So shall it be done unto
        that man that will not build up his brother's house.

025:010 And his name shall be called in Israel, The house of him that
        hath his shoe loosed.

025:011 When men strive together one with another, and the wife of the
        one draweth near for to deliver her husband out of the hand of
        him that smiteth him, and putteth forth her hand, and taketh
        him by the secrets:

025:012 Then thou shalt cut off her hand, thine eye shall not pity
        her.

025:013 Thou shalt not have in thy bag divers weights, a great and a
        small.

025:014 Thou shalt not have in thine house divers measures, a great
        and a small.

025:015 But thou shalt have a perfect and just weight, a perfect and
        just measure shalt thou have: that thy days may be lengthened
        in the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee.

025:016 For all that do such things, and all that do unrighteously,
        are an abomination unto the LORD thy God.

025:017 Remember what Amalek did unto thee by the way, when ye were
        come forth out of Egypt;

025:018 How he met thee by the way, and smote the hindmost of thee,
        even all that were feeble behind thee, when thou wast faint
        and weary; and he feared not God.

025:019 Therefore it shall be, when the LORD thy God hath given thee
        rest from all thine enemies round about, in the land which the
        LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance to possess it,
        that thou shalt blot out the remembrance of Amalek from under
        heaven; thou shalt not forget it.

026:001 And it shall be, when thou art come in unto the land which the
        LORD thy God giveth thee for an inheritance, and possessest
        it, and dwellest therein;

026:002 That thou shalt take of the first of all the fruit of the
        earth, which thou shalt bring of thy land that the LORD thy
        God giveth thee, and shalt put it in a basket, and shalt go
        unto the place which the LORD thy God shall choose to place
        his name there.

026:003 And thou shalt go unto the priest that shall be in those days,
        and say unto him, I profess this day unto the LORD thy God,
        that I am come unto the country which the LORD sware unto our
        fathers for to give us.

026:004 And the priest shall take the basket out of thine hand, and
        set it down before the altar of the LORD thy God.

026:005 And thou shalt speak and say before the LORD thy God, A Syrian
        ready to perish was my father, and he went down into Egypt,
        and sojourned there with a few, and became there a nation,
        great, mighty, and populous:

026:006 And the Egyptians evil entreated us, and afflicted us, and
        laid upon us hard bondage:

026:007 And when we cried unto the LORD God of our fathers, the LORD
        heard our voice, and looked on our affliction, and our labour,
        and our oppression:

026:008 And the LORD brought us forth out of Egypt with a mighty hand,
        and with an outstretched arm, and with great terribleness, and
        with signs, and with wonders:

026:009 And he hath brought us into this place, and hath given us this
        land, even a land that floweth with milk and honey.

026:010 And now, behold, I have brought the firstfruits of the land,
        which thou, O LORD, hast given me. And thou shalt set it
        before the LORD thy God, and worship before the LORD thy God:

026:011 And thou shalt rejoice in every good thing which the LORD thy
        God hath given unto thee, and unto thine house, thou, and the
        Levite, and the stranger that is among you.

026:012 When thou hast made an end of tithing all the tithes of thine
        increase the third year, which is the year of tithing, and
        hast given it unto the Levite, the stranger, the fatherless,
        and the widow, that they may eat within thy gates, and be
        filled;

026:013 Then thou shalt say before the LORD thy God, I have brought
        away the hallowed things out of mine house, and also have
        given them unto the Levite, and unto the stranger, to the
        fatherless, and to the widow, according to all thy
        commandments which thou hast commanded me: I have not
        transgressed thy commandments, neither have I forgotten them.

026:014 I have not eaten thereof in my mourning, neither have I taken
        away ought thereof for any unclean use, nor given ought
        thereof for the dead: but I have hearkened to the voice of the
        LORD my God, and have done according to all that thou hast
        commanded me.

026:015 Look down from thy holy habitation, from heaven, and bless thy
        people Israel, and the land which thou hast given us, as thou
        swarest unto our fathers, a land that floweth with milk and
        honey.

026:016 This day the LORD thy God hath commanded thee to do these
        statutes and judgments: thou shalt therefore keep and do them
        with all thine heart, and with all thy soul.

026:017 Thou hast avouched the LORD this day to be thy God, and to
        walk in his ways, and to keep his statutes, and his
        commandments, and his judgments, and to hearken unto his
        voice:

026:018 And the LORD hath avouched thee this day to be his peculiar
        people, as he hath promised thee, and that thou shouldest keep
        all his commandments;

026:019 And to make thee high above all nations which he hath made, in
        praise, and in name, and in honour; and that thou mayest be an
        holy people unto the LORD thy God, as he hath spoken.

027:001 And Moses with the elders of Israel commanded the people,
        saying, Keep all the commandments which I command you this
        day.

027:002 And it shall be on the day when ye shall pass over Jordan unto
        the land which the LORD thy God giveth thee, that thou shalt
        set thee up great stones, and plaister them with plaister:

027:003 And thou shalt write upon them all the words of this law, when
        thou art passed over, that thou mayest go in unto the land
        which the LORD thy God giveth thee, a land that floweth with
        milk and honey; as the LORD God of thy fathers hath promised
        thee.

027:004 Therefore it shall be when ye be gone over Jordan, that ye
        shall set up these stones, which I command you this day, in
        mount Ebal, and thou shalt plaister them with plaister.

027:005 And there shalt thou build an altar unto the LORD thy God, an
        altar of stones: thou shalt not lift up any iron tool upon
        them.

027:006 Thou shalt build the altar of the LORD thy God of whole
        stones: and thou shalt offer burnt offerings thereon unto the
        LORD thy God:

027:007 And thou shalt offer peace offerings, and shalt eat there, and
        rejoice before the LORD thy God.

027:008 And thou shalt write upon the stones all the words of this law
        very plainly.

027:009 And Moses and the priests the Levites spake unto all Israel,
        saying, Take heed, and hearken, O Israel; this day thou art
        become the people of the LORD thy God.

027:010 Thou shalt therefore obey the voice of the LORD thy God, and
        do his commandments and his statutes, which I command thee
        this day.

027:011 And Moses charged the people the same day, saying,

027:012 These shall stand upon mount Gerizim to bless the people, when
        ye are come over Jordan; Simeon, and Levi, and Judah, and
        Issachar, and Joseph, and Benjamin:

027:013 And these shall stand upon mount Ebal to curse; Reuben, Gad,
        and Asher, and Zebulun, Dan, and Naphtali.

027:014 And the Levites shall speak, and say unto all the men of
        Israel with a loud voice,

027:015 Cursed be the man that maketh any graven or molten image, an
        abomination unto the LORD, the work of the hands of the
        craftsman, and putteth it in a secret place. And all the
        people shall answer and say, Amen.

027:016 Cursed be he that setteth light by his father or his mother.
        And all the people shall say, Amen.

027:017 Cursed be he that removeth his neighbour's landmark. And all
        the people shall say, Amen.

027:018 Cursed be he that maketh the blind to wander out of the way.
        And all the people shall say, Amen.

027:019 Cursed be he that perverteth the judgment of the stranger,
        fatherless, and widow. And all the people shall say, Amen.

027:020 Cursed be he that lieth with his father's wife; because he
        uncovereth his father's skirt. And all the people shall say,
        Amen.

027:021 Cursed be he that lieth with any manner of beast. And all the
        people shall say, Amen.

027:022 Cursed be he that lieth with his sister, the daughter of his
        father, or the daughter of his mother. And all the people
        shall say, Amen.

027:023 Cursed be he that lieth with his mother in law. And all the
        people shall say, Amen.

027:024 Cursed be he that smiteth his neighbour secretly. And all the
        people shall say, Amen.

027:025 Cursed be he that taketh reward to slay an innocent person.
        And all the people shall say, Amen.

027:026 Cursed be he that confirmeth not all the words of this law to
        do them. And all the people shall say, Amen.

028:001 And it shall come to pass, if thou shalt hearken diligently
        unto the voice of the LORD thy God, to observe and to do all
        his commandments which I command thee this day, that the LORD
        thy God will set thee on high above all nations of the earth:

028:002 And all these blessings shall come on thee, and overtake thee,
        if thou shalt hearken unto the voice of the LORD thy God.

028:003 Blessed shalt thou be in the city, and blessed shalt thou be
        in the field.

028:004 Blessed shall be the fruit of thy body, and the fruit of thy
        ground, and the fruit of thy cattle, the increase of thy kine,
        and the flocks of thy sheep.

028:005 Blessed shall be thy basket and thy store.

028:006 Blessed shalt thou be when thou comest in, and blessed shalt
        thou be when thou goest out.

028:007 The LORD shall cause thine enemies that rise up against thee
        to be smitten before thy face: they shall come out against
        thee one way, and flee before thee seven ways.

028:008 The LORD shall command the blessing upon thee in thy
        storehouses, and in all that thou settest thine hand unto; and
        he shall bless thee in the land which the LORD thy God giveth
        thee.

028:009 The LORD shall establish thee an holy people unto himself, as
        he hath sworn unto thee, if thou shalt keep the commandments
        of the LORD thy God, and walk in his ways.

028:010 And all people of the earth shall see that thou art called by
        the name of the LORD; and they shall be afraid of thee.

028:011 And the LORD shall make thee plenteous in goods, in the fruit
        of thy body, and in the fruit of thy cattle, and in the fruit
        of thy ground, in the land which the LORD sware unto thy
        fathers to give thee.

028:012 The LORD shall open unto thee his good treasure, the heaven to
        give the rain unto thy land in his season, and to bless all
        the work of thine hand: and thou shalt lend unto many nations,
        and thou shalt not borrow.

028:013 And the LORD shall make thee the head, and not the tail; and
        thou shalt be above only, and thou shalt not be beneath; if
        that thou hearken unto the commandments of the LORD thy God,
        which I command thee this day, to observe and to do them:

028:014 And thou shalt not go aside from any of the words which I
        command thee this day, to the right hand, or to the left, to
        go after other gods to serve them.

028:015 But it shall come to pass, if thou wilt not hearken unto the
        voice of the LORD thy God, to observe to do all his
        commandments and his statutes which I command thee this day;
        that all these curses shall come upon thee, and overtake thee:

028:016 Cursed shalt thou be in the city, and cursed shalt thou be in
        the field.

028:017 Cursed shall be thy basket and thy store.

028:018 Cursed shall be the fruit of thy body, and the fruit of thy
        land, the increase of thy kine, and the flocks of thy sheep.

028:019 Cursed shalt thou be when thou comest in, and cursed shalt
        thou be when thou goest out.

028:020 The LORD shall send upon thee cursing, vexation, and rebuke,
        in all that thou settest thine hand unto for to do, until thou
        be destroyed, and until thou perish quickly; because of the
        wickedness of thy doings, whereby thou hast forsaken me.

028:021 The LORD shall make the pestilence cleave unto thee, until he
        have consumed thee from off the land, whither thou goest to
        possess it.

028:022 The LORD shall smite thee with a consumption, and with a
        fever, and with an inflammation, and with an extreme burning,
        and with the sword, and with blasting, and with mildew; and
        they shall pursue thee until thou perish.

028:023 And thy heaven that is over thy head shall be brass, and the
        earth that is under thee shall be iron.

028:024 The LORD shall make the rain of thy land powder and dust: from
        heaven shall it come down upon thee, until thou be destroyed.

028:025 The LORD shall cause thee to be smitten before thine enemies:
        thou shalt go out one way against them, and flee seven ways
        before them: and shalt be removed into all the kingdoms of the
        earth.

028:026 And thy carcase shall be meat unto all fowls of the air, and
        unto the beasts of the earth, and no man shall fray them away.

028:027 The LORD will smite thee with the botch of Egypt, and with the
        emerods, and with the scab, and with the itch, whereof thou
        canst not be healed.

028:028 The LORD shall smite thee with madness, and blindness, and
        astonishment of heart:

028:029 And thou shalt grope at noonday, as the blind gropeth in
        darkness, and thou shalt not prosper in thy ways: and thou
        shalt be only oppressed and spoiled evermore, and no man shall
        save thee.

028:030 Thou shalt betroth a wife, and another man shall lie with her:
        thou shalt build an house, and thou shalt not dwell therein:
        thou shalt plant a vineyard, and shalt not gather the grapes
        thereof.

028:031 Thine ox shall be slain before thine eyes, and thou shalt not
        eat thereof: thine ass shall be violently taken away from
        before thy face, and shall not be restored to thee: thy sheep
        shall be given unto thine enemies, and thou shalt have none to
        rescue them.

028:032 Thy sons and thy daughters shall be given unto another people,
        and thine eyes shall look, and fail with longing for them all
        the day long; and there shall be no might in thine hand.

028:033 The fruit of thy land, and all thy labours, shall a nation
        which thou knowest not eat up; and thou shalt be only
        oppressed and crushed alway:

028:034 So that thou shalt be mad for the sight of thine eyes which
        thou shalt see.

028:035 The LORD shall smite thee in the knees, and in the legs, with
        a sore botch that cannot be healed, from the sole of thy foot
        unto the top of thy head.

028:036 The LORD shall bring thee, and thy king which thou shalt set
        over thee, unto a nation which neither thou nor thy fathers
        have known; and there shalt thou serve other gods, wood and
        stone.

028:037 And thou shalt become an astonishment, a proverb, and a
        byword, among all nations whither the LORD shall lead thee.

028:038 Thou shalt carry much seed out into the field, and shalt
        gather but little in; for the locust shall consume it.

028:039 Thou shalt plant vineyards, and dress them, but shalt neither
        drink of the wine, nor gather the grapes; for the worms shall
        eat them.

028:040 Thou shalt have olive trees throughout all thy coasts, but
        thou shalt not anoint thyself with the oil; for thine olive
        shall cast his fruit.

028:041 Thou shalt beget sons and daughters, but thou shalt not enjoy
        them; for they shall go into captivity.

028:042 All thy trees and fruit of thy land shall the locust consume.

028:043 The stranger that is within thee shall get up above thee very
        high; and thou shalt come down very low.

028:044 He shall lend to thee, and thou shalt not lend to him: he
        shall be the head, and thou shalt be the tail.

028:045 Moreover all these curses shall come upon thee, and shall
        pursue thee, and overtake thee, till thou be destroyed;
        because thou hearkenedst not unto the voice of the LORD thy
        God, to keep his commandments and his statutes which he
        commanded thee:

028:046 And they shall be upon thee for a sign and for a wonder, and
        upon thy seed for ever.

028:047 Because thou servedst not the LORD thy God with joyfulness,
        and with gladness of heart, for the abundance of all things;

028:048 Therefore shalt thou serve thine enemies which the LORD shall
        send against thee, in hunger, and in thirst, and in nakedness,
        and in want of all things: and he shall put a yoke of iron
        upon thy neck, until he have destroyed thee.

028:049 The LORD shall bring a nation against thee from far, from the
        end of the earth, as swift as the eagle flieth; a nation whose
        tongue thou shalt not understand;

028:050 A nation of fierce countenance, which shall not regard the
        person of the old, nor shew favour to the young:

028:051 And he shall eat the fruit of thy cattle, and the fruit of thy
        land, until thou be destroyed: which also shall not leave thee
        either corn, wine, or oil, or the increase of thy kine, or
        flocks of thy sheep, until he have destroyed thee.

028:052 And he shall besiege thee in all thy gates, until thy high and
        fenced walls come down, wherein thou trustedst, throughout all
        thy land: and he shall besiege thee in all thy gates
        throughout all thy land, which the LORD thy God hath given
        thee.

028:053 And thou shalt eat the fruit of thine own body, the flesh of
        thy sons and of thy daughters, which the LORD thy God hath
        given thee, in the siege, and in the straitness, wherewith
        thine enemies shall distress thee:

028:054 So that the man that is tender among you, and very delicate,
        his eye shall be evil toward his brother, and toward the wife
        of his bosom, and toward the remnant of his children which he
        shall leave:

028:055 So that he will not give to any of them of the flesh of his
        children whom he shall eat: because he hath nothing left him
        in the siege, and in the straitness, wherewith thine enemies
        shall distress thee in all thy gates.

028:056 The tender and delicate woman among you, which would not
        adventure to set the sole of her foot upon the ground for
        delicateness and tenderness, her eye shall be evil toward the
        husband of her bosom, and toward her son, and toward her
        daughter,

028:057 And toward her young one that cometh out from between her
        feet, and toward her children which she shall bear: for she
        shall eat them for want of all things secretly in the siege
        and straitness, wherewith thine enemy shall distress thee in
        thy gates.

028:058 If thou wilt not observe to do all the words of this law that
        are written in this book, that thou mayest fear this glorious
        and fearful name, THE LORD THY GOD;

028:059 Then the LORD will make thy plagues wonderful, and the plagues
        of thy seed, even great plagues, and of long continuance, and
        sore sicknesses, and of long continuance.

028:060 Moreover he will bring upon thee all the diseases of Egypt,
        which thou wast afraid of; and they shall cleave unto thee.

028:061 Also every sickness, and every plague, which is not written in
        the book of this law, them will the LORD bring upon thee,
        until thou be destroyed.

028:062 And ye shall be left few in number, whereas ye were as the
        stars of heaven for multitude; because thou wouldest not obey
        the voice of the LORD thy God.

028:063 And it shall come to pass, that as the LORD rejoiced over you
        to do you good, and to multiply you; so the LORD will rejoice
        over you to destroy you, and to bring you to nought; and ye
        shall be plucked from off the land whither thou goest to
        possess it.

028:064 And the LORD shall scatter thee among all people, from the one
        end of the earth even unto the other; and there thou shalt
        serve other gods, which neither thou nor thy fathers have
        known, even wood and stone.

028:065 And among these nations shalt thou find no ease, neither shall
        the sole of thy foot have rest: but the LORD shall give thee
        there a trembling heart, and failing of eyes, and sorrow of
        mind:

028:066 And thy life shall hang in doubt before thee; and thou shalt
        fear day and night, and shalt have none assurance of thy life:

028:067 In the morning thou shalt say, Would God it were even! and at
        even thou shalt say, Would God it were morning! for the fear
        of thine heart wherewith thou shalt fear, and for the sight of
        thine eyes which thou shalt see.

028:068 And the LORD shall bring thee into Egypt again with ships, by
        the way whereof I spake unto thee, Thou shalt see it no more
        again: and there ye shall be sold unto your enemies for
        bondmen and bondwomen, and no man shall buy you.

029:001 These are the words of the covenant, which the LORD commanded
        Moses to make with the children of Israel in the land of Moab,
        beside the covenant which he made with them in Horeb.

029:002 And Moses called unto all Israel, and said unto them, Ye have
        seen all that the LORD did before your eyes in the land of
        Egypt unto Pharaoh, and unto all his servants, and unto all
        his land;

029:003 The great temptations which thine eyes have seen, the signs,
        and those great miracles:

029:004 Yet the LORD hath not given you an heart to perceive, and eyes
        to see, and ears to hear, unto this day.

029:005 And I have led you forty years in the wilderness: your clothes
        are not waxen old upon you, and thy shoe is not waxen old upon
        thy foot.

029:006 Ye have not eaten bread, neither have ye drunk wine or strong
        drink: that ye might know that I am the LORD your God.

029:007 And when ye came unto this place, Sihon the king of Heshbon,
        and Og the king of Bashan, came out against us unto battle,
        and we smote them:

029:008 And we took their land, and gave it for an inheritance unto
        the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to the half tribe of
        Manasseh.

029:009 Keep therefore the words of this covenant, and do them, that
        ye may prosper in all that ye do.

029:010 Ye stand this day all of you before the LORD your God; your
        captains of your tribes, your elders, and your officers, with
        all the men of Israel,

029:011 Your little ones, your wives, and thy stranger that is in thy
        camp, from the hewer of thy wood unto the drawer of thy water:

029:012 That thou shouldest enter into covenant with the LORD thy God,
        and into his oath, which the LORD thy God maketh with thee
        this day:

029:013 That he may establish thee to day for a people unto himself,
        and that he may be unto thee a God, as he hath said unto thee,
        and as he hath sworn unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac,
        and to Jacob.

029:014 Neither with you only do I make this covenant and this oath;

029:015 But with him that standeth here with us this day before the
        LORD our God, and also with him that is not here with us this
        day:

029:016 (For ye know how we have dwelt in the land of Egypt; and how
        we came through the nations which ye passed by;

029:017 And ye have seen their abominations, and their idols, wood and
        stone, silver and gold, which were among them:)

029:018 Lest there should be among you man, or woman, or family, or
        tribe, whose heart turneth away this day from the LORD our
        God, to go and serve the gods of these nations; lest there
        should be among you a root that beareth gall and wormwood;

029:019 And it come to pass, when he heareth the words of this curse,
        that he bless himself in his heart, saying, I shall have
        peace, though I walk in the imagination of mine heart, to add
        drunkenness to thirst:

029:020 The LORD will not spare him, but then the anger of the LORD
        and his jealousy shall smoke against that man, and all the
        curses that are written in this book shall lie upon him, and
        the LORD shall blot out his name from under heaven.

029:021 And the LORD shall separate him unto evil out of all the
        tribes of Israel, according to all the curses of the covenant
        that are written in this book of the law:

029:022 So that the generation to come of your children that shall
        rise up after you, and the stranger that shall come from a far
        land, shall say, when they see the plagues of that land, and
        the sicknesses which the LORD hath laid upon it;

029:023 And that the whole land thereof is brimstone, and salt, and
        burning, that it is not sown, nor beareth, nor any grass
        groweth therein, like the overthrow of Sodom, and Gomorrah,
        Admah, and Zeboim, which the LORD overthrew in his anger, and
        in his wrath:

029:024 Even all nations shall say, Wherefore hath the LORD done thus
        unto this land? what meaneth the heat of this great anger?

029:025 Then men shall say, Because they have forsaken the covenant of
        the LORD God of their fathers, which he made with them when he
        brought them forth out of the land of Egypt:

029:026 For they went and served other gods, and worshipped them, gods
        whom they knew not, and whom he had not given unto them:

029:027 And the anger of the LORD was kindled against this land, to
        bring upon it all the curses that are written in this book:

029:028 And the LORD rooted them out of their land in anger, and in
        wrath, and in great indignation, and cast them into another
        land, as it is this day.

029:029 The secret things belong unto the LORD our God: but those
        things which are revealed belong unto us and to our children
        for ever, that we may do all the words of this law.

030:001 And it shall come to pass, when all these things are come upon
        thee, the blessing and the curse, which I have set before
        thee, and thou shalt call them to mind among all the nations,
        whither the LORD thy God hath driven thee,

030:002 And shalt return unto the LORD thy God, and shalt obey his
        voice according to all that I command thee this day, thou and
        thy children, with all thine heart, and with all thy soul;

030:003 That then the LORD thy God will turn thy captivity, and have
        compassion upon thee, and will return and gather thee from all
        the nations, whither the LORD thy God hath scattered thee.

030:004 If any of thine be driven out unto the outmost parts of
        heaven, from thence will the LORD thy God gather thee, and
        from thence will he fetch thee:

030:005 And the LORD thy God will bring thee into the land which thy
        fathers possessed, and thou shalt possess it; and he will do
        thee good, and multiply thee above thy fathers.

030:006 And the LORD thy God will circumcise thine heart, and the
        heart of thy seed, to love the LORD thy God with all thine
        heart, and with all thy soul, that thou mayest live.

030:007 And the LORD thy God will put all these curses upon thine
        enemies, and on them that hate thee, which persecuted thee.

030:008 And thou shalt return and obey the voice of the LORD, and do
        all his commandments which I command thee this day.

030:009 And the LORD thy God will make thee plenteous in every work of
        thine hand, in the fruit of thy body, and in the fruit of thy
        cattle, and in the fruit of thy land, for good: for the LORD
        will again rejoice over thee for good, as he rejoiced over thy
        fathers:

030:010 If thou shalt hearken unto the voice of the LORD thy God, to
        keep his commandments and his statutes which are written in
        this book of the law, and if thou turn unto the LORD thy God
        with all thine heart, and with all thy soul.

030:011 For this commandment which I command thee this day, it is not
        hidden from thee, neither is it far off.

030:012 It is not in heaven, that thou shouldest say, Who shall go up
        for us to heaven, and bring it unto us, that we may hear it,
        and do it?

030:013 Neither is it beyond the sea, that thou shouldest say, Who
        shall go over the sea for us, and bring it unto us, that we
        may hear it, and do it?

030:014 But the word is very nigh unto thee, in thy mouth, and in thy
        heart, that thou mayest do it.

030:015 See, I have set before thee this day life and good, and death
        and evil;

030:016 In that I command thee this day to love the LORD thy God, to
        walk in his ways, and to keep his commandments and his
        statutes and his judgments, that thou mayest live and
        multiply: and the LORD thy God shall bless thee in the land
        whither thou goest to possess it.

030:017 But if thine heart turn away, so that thou wilt not hear, but
        shalt be drawn away, and worship other gods, and serve them;

030:018 I denounce unto you this day, that ye shall surely perish, and
        that ye shall not prolong your days upon the land, whither
        thou passest over Jordan to go to possess it.

030:019 I call heaven and earth to record this day against you, that I
        have set before you life and death, blessing and cursing:
        therefore choose life, that both thou and thy seed may live:

030:020 That thou mayest love the LORD thy God, and that thou mayest
        obey his voice, and that thou mayest cleave unto him: for he
        is thy life, and the length of thy days: that thou mayest
        dwell in the land which the LORD sware unto thy fathers, to
        Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give them.

031:001 And Moses went and spake these words unto all Israel.

031:002 And he said unto them, I am an hundred and twenty years old
        this day; I can no more go out and come in: also the LORD hath
        said unto me, Thou shalt not go over this Jordan.

031:003 The LORD thy God, he will go over before thee, and he will
        destroy these nations from before thee, and thou shalt possess
        them: and Joshua, he shall go over before thee, as the LORD
        hath said.

031:004 And the LORD shall do unto them as he did to Sihon and to Og,
        kings of the Amorites, and unto the land of them, whom he
        destroyed.

031:005 And the LORD shall give them up before your face, that ye may
        do unto them according unto all the commandments which I have
        commanded you.

031:006 Be strong and of a good courage, fear not, nor be afraid of
        them: for the LORD thy God, he it is that doth go with thee;
        he will not fail thee, nor forsake thee.

031:007 And Moses called unto Joshua, and said unto him in the sight
        of all Israel, Be strong and of a good courage: for thou must
        go with this people unto the land which the LORD hath sworn
        unto their fathers to give them; and thou shalt cause them to
        inherit it.

031:008 And the LORD, he it is that doth go before thee; he will be
        with thee, he will not fail thee, neither forsake thee: fear
        not, neither be dismayed.

031:009 And Moses wrote this law, and delivered it unto the priests
        the sons of Levi, which bare the ark of the covenant of the
        LORD, and unto all the elders of Israel.

031:010 And Moses commanded them, saying, At the end of every seven
        years, in the solemnity of the year of release, in the feast
        of tabernacles,

031:011 When all Israel is come to appear before the LORD thy God in
        the place which he shall choose, thou shalt read this law
        before all Israel in their hearing.

031:012 Gather the people together, men and women, and children, and
        thy stranger that is within thy gates, that they may hear, and
        that they may learn, and fear the LORD your God, and observe
        to do all the words of this law:

031:013 And that their children, which have not known any thing, may
        hear, and learn to fear the LORD your God, as long as ye live
        in the land whither ye go over Jordan to possess it.

031:014 And the LORD said unto Moses, Behold, thy days approach that
        thou must die: call Joshua, and present yourselves in the
        tabernacle of the congregation, that I may give him a charge.
        And Moses and Joshua went, and presented themselves in the
        tabernacle of the congregation.

031:015 And the LORD appeared in the tabernacle in a pillar of a
        cloud: and the pillar of the cloud stood over the door of the
        tabernacle.

031:016 And the LORD said unto Moses, Behold, thou shalt sleep with
        thy fathers; and this people will rise up, and go a whoring
        after the gods of the strangers of the land, whither they go
        to be among them, and will forsake me, and break my covenant
        which I have made with them.

031:017 Then my anger shall be kindled against them in that day, and I
        will forsake them, and I will hide my face from them, and they
        shall be devoured, and many evils and troubles shall befall
        them; so that they will say in that day, Are not these evils
        come upon us, because our God is not among us?

031:018 And I will surely hide my face in that day for all the evils
        which they shall have wrought, in that they are turned unto
        other gods.

031:019 Now therefore write ye this song for you, and teach it the
        children of Israel: put it in their mouths, that this song may
        be a witness for me against the children of Israel.

031:020 For when I shall have brought them into the land which I sware
        unto their fathers, that floweth with milk and honey; and they
        shall have eaten and filled themselves, and waxen fat; then
        will they turn unto other gods, and serve them, and provoke
        me, and break my covenant.

031:021 And it shall come to pass, when many evils and troubles are
        befallen them, that this song shall testify against them as a
        witness; for it shall not be forgotten out of the mouths of
        their seed: for I know their imagination which they go about,
        even now, before I have brought them into the land which I
        sware.

031:022 Moses therefore wrote this song the same day, and taught it
        the children of Israel.

031:023 And he gave Joshua the son of Nun a charge, and said, Be
        strong and of a good courage: for thou shalt bring the
        children of Israel into the land which I sware unto them: and
        I will be with thee.

031:024 And it came to pass, when Moses had made an end of writing the
        words of this law in a book, until they were finished,

031:025 That Moses commanded the Levites, which bare the ark of the
        covenant of the LORD, saying,

031:026 Take this book of the law, and put it in the side of the ark
        of the covenant of the LORD your God, that it may be there for
        a witness against thee.

031:027 For I know thy rebellion, and thy stiff neck: behold, while I
        am yet alive with you this day, ye have been rebellious
        against the LORD; and how much more after my death?

031:028 Gather unto me all the elders of your tribes, and your
        officers, that I may speak these words in their ears, and call
        heaven and earth to record against them.

031:029 For I know that after my death ye will utterly corrupt
        yourselves, and turn aside from the way which I have commanded
        you; and evil will befall you in the latter days; because ye
        will do evil in the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger
        through the work of your hands.

031:030 And Moses spake in the ears of all the congregation of Israel
        the words of this song, until they were ended.

032:001 Give ear, O ye heavens, and I will speak; and hear, O earth,
        the words of my mouth.

032:002 My doctrine shall drop as the rain, my speech shall distil as
        the dew, as the small rain upon the tender herb, and as the
        showers upon the grass:

032:003 Because I will publish the name of the LORD: ascribe ye
        greatness unto our God.

032:004 He is the Rock, his work is perfect: for all his ways are
        judgment: a God of truth and without iniquity, just and right
        is he.

032:005 They have corrupted themselves, their spot is not the spot of
        his children: they are a perverse and crooked generation.

032:006 Do ye thus requite the LORD, O foolish people and unwise? is
        not he thy father that hath bought thee? hath he not made
        thee, and established thee?

032:007 Remember the days of old, consider the years of many
        generations: ask thy father, and he will shew thee; thy
        elders, and they will tell thee.

032:008 When the Most High divided to the nations their inheritance,
        when he separated the sons of Adam, he set the bounds of the
        people according to the number of the children of Israel.

032:009 For the LORD's portion is his people; Jacob is the lot of his
        inheritance.

032:010 He found him in a desert land, and in the waste howling
        wilderness; he led him about, he instructed him, he kept him
        as the apple of his eye.

032:011 As an eagle stirreth up her nest, fluttereth over her young,
        spreadeth abroad her wings, taketh them, beareth them on her
        wings:

032:012 So the LORD alone did lead him, and there was no strange god
        with him.

032:013 He made him ride on the high places of the earth, that he
        might eat the increase of the fields; and he made him to suck
        honey out of the rock, and oil out of the flinty rock;

032:014 Butter of kine, and milk of sheep, with fat of lambs, and rams
        of the breed of Bashan, and goats, with the fat of kidneys of
        wheat; and thou didst drink the pure blood of the grape.

032:015 But Jeshurun waxed fat, and kicked: thou art waxen fat, thou
        art grown thick, thou art covered with fatness; then he
        forsook God which made him, and lightly esteemed the Rock of
        his salvation.

032:016 They provoked him to jealousy with strange gods, with
        abominations provoked they him to anger.

032:017 They sacrificed unto devils, not to God; to gods whom they
        knew not, to new gods that came newly up, whom your fathers
        feared not.

032:018 Of the Rock that begat thee thou art unmindful, and hast
        forgotten God that formed thee.

032:019 And when the LORD saw it, he abhorred them, because of the
        provoking of his sons, and of his daughters.

032:020 And he said, I will hide my face from them, I will see what
        their end shall be: for they are a very froward generation,
        children in whom is no faith.

032:021 They have moved me to jealousy with that which is not God;
        they have provoked me to anger with their vanities: and I will
        move them to jealousy with those which are not a people; I
        will provoke them to anger with a foolish nation.

032:022 For a fire is kindled in mine anger, and shall burn unto the
        lowest hell, and shall consume the earth with her increase,
        and set on fire the foundations of the mountains.

032:023 I will heap mischiefs upon them; I will spend mine arrows upon
        them.

032:024 They shall be burnt with hunger, and devoured with burning
        heat, and with bitter destruction: I will also send the teeth
        of beasts upon them, with the poison of serpents of the dust.

032:025 The sword without, and terror within, shall destroy both the
        young man and the virgin, the suckling also with the man of
        gray hairs.

032:026 I said, I would scatter them into corners, I would make the
        remembrance of them to cease from among men:

032:027 Were it not that I feared the wrath of the enemy, lest their
        adversaries should behave themselves strangely, and lest they
        should say, Our hand is high, and the LORD hath not done all
        this.

032:028 For they are a nation void of counsel, neither is there any
        understanding in them.

032:029 O that they were wise, that they understood this, that they
        would consider their latter end!

032:030 How should one chase a thousand, and two put ten thousand to
        flight, except their Rock had sold them, and the LORD had shut
        them up?

032:031 For their rock is not as our Rock, even our enemies themselves
        being judges.

032:032 For their vine is of the vine of Sodom, and of the fields of
        Gomorrah: their grapes are grapes of gall, their clusters are
        bitter:

032:033 Their wine is the poison of dragons, and the cruel venom of
        asps.

032:034 Is not this laid up in store with me, and sealed up among my
        treasures?

032:035 To me belongeth vengeance and recompence; their foot shall
        slide in due time: for the day of their calamity is at hand,
        and the things that shall come upon them make haste.

032:036 For the LORD shall judge his people, and repent himself for
        his servants, when he seeth that their power is gone, and
        there is none shut up, or left.

032:037 And he shall say, Where are their gods, their rock in whom
        they trusted,

032:038 Which did eat the fat of their sacrifices, and drank the wine
        of their drink offerings? let them rise up and help you, and
        be your protection.

032:039 See now that I, even I, am he, and there is no god with me: I
        kill, and I make alive; I wound, and I heal: neither is there
        any that can deliver out of my hand.

032:040 For I lift up my hand to heaven, and say, I live for ever.

032:041 If I whet my glittering sword, and mine hand take hold on
        judgment; I will render vengeance to mine enemies, and will
        reward them that hate me.

032:042 I will make mine arrows drunk with blood, and my sword shall
        devour flesh; and that with the blood of the slain and of the
        captives, from the beginning of revenges upon the enemy.

032:043 Rejoice, O ye nations, with his people: for he will avenge the
        blood of his servants, and will render vengeance to his
        adversaries, and will be merciful unto his land, and to his
        people.

032:044 And Moses came and spake all the words of this song in the
        ears of the people, he, and Hoshea the son of Nun.

032:045 And Moses made an end of speaking all these words to all
        Israel:

032:046 And he said unto them, Set your hearts unto all the words
        which I testify among you this day, which ye shall command
        your children to observe to do, all the words of this law.

032:047 For it is not a vain thing for you; because it is your life:
        and through this thing ye shall prolong your days in the land,
        whither ye go over Jordan to possess it.

032:048 And the LORD spake unto Moses that selfsame day, saying,

032:049 Get thee up into this mountain Abarim, unto mount Nebo, which
        is in the land of Moab, that is over against Jericho; and
        behold the land of Canaan, which I give unto the children of
        Israel for a possession:

032:050 And die in the mount whither thou goest up, and be gathered
        unto thy people; as Aaron thy brother died in mount Hor, and
        was gathered unto his people:

032:051 Because ye trespassed against me among the children of Israel
        at the waters of MeribahKadesh, in the wilderness of Zin;
        because ye sanctified me not in the midst of the children of
        Israel.

032:052 Yet thou shalt see the land before thee; but thou shalt not go
        thither unto the land which I give the children of Israel.

033:001 And this is the blessing, wherewith Moses the man of God
        blessed the children of Israel before his death.

033:002 And he said, The LORD came from Sinai, and rose up from Seir
        unto them; he shined forth from mount Paran, and he came with
        ten thousands of saints: from his right hand went a fiery law
        for them.

033:003 Yea, he loved the people; all his saints are in thy hand: and
        they sat down at thy feet; every one shall receive of thy
        words.

033:004 Moses commanded us a law, even the inheritance of the
        congregation of Jacob.

033:005 And he was king in Jeshurun, when the heads of the people and
        the tribes of Israel were gathered together.

033:006 Let Reuben live, and not die; and let not his men be few.

033:007 And this is the blessing of Judah: and he said, Hear, LORD,
        the voice of Judah, and bring him unto his people: let his
        hands be sufficient for him; and be thou an help to him from
        his enemies.

033:008 And of Levi he said, Let thy Thummim and thy Urim be with thy
        holy one, whom thou didst prove at Massah, and with whom thou
        didst strive at the waters of Meribah;

033:009 Who said unto his father and to his mother, I have not seen
        him; neither did he acknowledge his brethren, nor knew his own
        children: for they have observed thy word, and kept thy
        covenant.

033:010 They shall teach Jacob thy judgments, and Israel thy law: they
        shall put incense before thee, and whole burnt sacrifice upon
        thine altar.

033:011 Bless, LORD, his substance, and accept the work of his hands;
        smite through the loins of them that rise against him, and of
        them that hate him, that they rise not again.

033:012 And of Benjamin he said, The beloved of the LORD shall dwell
        in safety by him; and the Lord shall cover him all the day
        long, and he shall dwell between his shoulders.

033:013 And of Joseph he said, Blessed of the LORD be his land, for
        the precious things of heaven, for the dew, and for the deep
        that coucheth beneath,

033:014 And for the precious fruits brought forth by the sun, and for
        the precious things put forth by the moon,

033:015 And for the chief things of the ancient mountains, and for the
        precious things of the lasting hills,

033:016 And for the precious things of the earth and fulness thereof,
        and for the good will of him that dwelt in the bush: let the
        blessing come upon the head of Joseph, and upon the top of the
        head of him that was separated from his brethren.

033:017 His glory is like the firstling of his bullock, and his horns
        are like the horns of unicorns: with them he shall push the
        people together to the ends of the earth: and they are the ten
        thousands of Ephraim, and they are the thousands of Manasseh.

033:018 And of Zebulun he said, Rejoice, Zebulun, in thy going out;
        and, Issachar, in thy tents.

033:019 They shall call the people unto the mountain; there they shall
        offer sacrifices of righteousness: for they shall suck of the
        abundance of the seas, and of treasures hid in the sand.

033:020 And of Gad he said, Blessed be he that enlargeth Gad: he
        dwelleth as a lion, and teareth the arm with the crown of the
        head.

033:021 And he provided the first part for himself, because there, in
        a portion of the lawgiver, was he seated; and he came with the
        heads of the people, he executed the justice of the LORD, and
        his judgments with Israel.

033:022 And of Dan he said, Dan is a lion's whelp: he shall leap from
        Bashan.

033:023 And of Naphtali he said, O Naphtali, satisfied with favour,
        and full with the blessing of the LORD: possess thou the west
        and the south.

033:024 And of Asher he said, Let Asher be blessed with children; let
        him be acceptable to his brethren, and let him dip his foot in
        oil.

033:025 Thy shoes shall be iron and brass; and as thy days, so shall
        thy strength be.

033:026 There is none like unto the God of Jeshurun, who rideth upon
        the heaven in thy help, and in his excellency on the sky.

033:027 The eternal God is thy refuge, and underneath are the
        everlasting arms: and he shall thrust out the enemy from
        before thee; and shall say, Destroy them.

033:028 Israel then shall dwell in safety alone: the fountain of Jacob
        shall be upon a land of corn and wine; also his heavens shall
        drop down dew.

033:029 Happy art thou, O Israel: who is like unto thee, O people
        saved by the LORD, the shield of thy help, and who is the
        sword of thy excellency! and thine enemies shall be found
        liars unto thee; and thou shalt tread upon their high places.

034:001 And Moses went up from the plains of Moab unto the mountain of
        Nebo, to the top of Pisgah, that is over against Jericho. And
        the LORD shewed him all the land of Gilead, unto Dan,

034:002 And all Naphtali, and the land of Ephraim, and Manasseh, and
        all the land of Judah, unto the utmost sea,

034:003 And the south, and the plain of the valley of Jericho, the
        city of palm trees, unto Zoar.

034:004 And the LORD said unto him, This is the land which I sware
        unto Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, saying, I will give
        it unto thy seed: I have caused thee to see it with thine
        eyes, but thou shalt not go over thither.

034:005 So Moses the servant of the LORD died there in the land of
        Moab, according to the word of the LORD.

034:006 And he buried him in a valley in the land of Moab, over
        against Bethpeor: but no man knoweth of his sepulchre unto
        this day.

034:007 And Moses was an hundred and twenty years old when he died:
        his eye was not dim, nor his natural force abated.

034:008 And the children of Israel wept for Moses in the plains of
        Moab thirty days: so the days of weeping and mourning for
        Moses were ended.

034:009 And Joshua the son of Nun was full of the spirit of wisdom;
        for Moses had laid his hands upon him: and the children of
        Israel hearkened unto him, and did as the LORD commanded
        Moses.

034:010 And there arose not a prophet since in Israel like unto Moses,
        whom the LORD knew face to face,

034:011 In all the signs and the wonders, which the LORD sent him to
        do in the land of Egypt to Pharaoh, and to all his servants,
        and to all his land,

034:012 And in all that mighty hand, and in all the great terror which
        Moses shewed in the sight of all Israel.

Book 06	Joshua

001:001 Now after the death of Moses the servant of the LORD it came
        to pass, that the LORD spake unto Joshua the son of Nun,
        Moses' minister, saying,

001:002 Moses my servant is dead; now therefore arise, go over this
        Jordan, thou, and all this people, unto the land which I do
        give to them, even to the children of Israel.

001:003 Every place that the sole of your foot shall tread upon, that
        have I given unto you, as I said unto Moses.

001:004 From the wilderness and this Lebanon even unto the great
        river, the river Euphrates, all the land of the Hittites, and
        unto the great sea toward the going down of the sun, shall be
        your coast.

001:005 There shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the
        days of thy life: as I was with Moses, so I will be with thee:
        I will not fail thee, nor forsake thee.

001:006 Be strong and of a good courage: for unto this people shalt
        thou divide for an inheritance the land, which I sware unto
        their fathers to give them.

001:007 Only be thou strong and very courageous, that thou mayest
        observe to do according to all the law, which Moses my servant
        commanded thee: turn not from it to the right hand or to the
        left, that thou mayest prosper withersoever thou goest.

001:008 This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth; but
        thou shalt meditate therein day and night, that thou mayest
        observe to do according to all that is written therein: for
        then thou shalt make thy way prosperous, and then thou shalt
        have good success.

001:009 Have not I commanded thee? Be strong and of a good courage; be
        not afraid, neither be thou dismayed: for the LORD thy God is
        with thee whithersoever thou goest.

001:010 Then Joshua commanded the officers of the people, saying,

001:011 Pass through the host, and command the people, saying, Prepare
        you victuals; for within three days ye shall pass over this
        Jordan, to go in to possess the land, which the LORD your God
        giveth you to possess it.

001:012 And to the Reubenites, and to the Gadites, and to half the
        tribe of Manasseh, spake Joshua, saying,

001:013 Remember the word which Moses the servant of the LORD
        commanded you, saying, The LORD your God hath given you rest,
        and hath given you this land.

001:014 Your wives, your little ones, and your cattle, shall remain in
        the land which Moses gave you on this side Jordan; but ye
        shall pass before your brethren armed, all the mighty men of
        valour, and help them;

001:015 Until the LORD have given your brethren rest, as he hath given
        you, and they also have possessed the land which the LORD your
        God giveth them: then ye shall return unto the land of your
        possession, and enjoy it, which Moses the LORD's servant gave
        you on this side Jordan toward the sunrising.

001:016 And they answered Joshua, saying, All that thou commandest us
        we will do, and whithersoever thou sendest us, we will go.

001:017 According as we hearkened unto Moses in all things, so will we
        hearken unto thee: only the LORD thy God be with thee, as he
        was with Moses.

001:018 Whosoever he be that doth rebel against thy commandment, and
        will not hearken unto thy words in all that thou commandest
        him, he shall be put to death: only be strong and of a good
        courage.

002:001 And Joshua the son of Nun sent out of Shittim two men to spy
        secretly, saying, Go view the land, even Jericho. And they
        went, and came into an harlot's house, named Rahab, and lodged
        there.

002:002 And it was told the king of Jericho, saying, Behold, there
        came men in hither to night of the children of Israel to
        search out the country.

002:003 And the king of Jericho sent unto Rahab, saying, Bring forth
        the men that are come to thee, which are entered into thine
        house: for they be come to search out all the country.

002:004 And the woman took the two men, and hid them, and said thus,
        There came men unto me, but I wist not whence they were:

002:005 And it came to pass about the time of shutting of the gate,
        when it was dark, that the men went out: whither the men went
        I wot not: pursue after them quickly; for ye shall overtake
        them.

002:006 But she had brought them up to the roof of the house, and hid
        them with the stalks of flax, which she had laid in order upon
        the roof.

002:007 And the men pursued after them the way to Jordan unto the
        fords: and as soon as they which pursued after them were gone
        out, they shut the gate.

002:008 And before they were laid down, she came up unto them upon the
        roof;

002:009 And she said unto the men, I know that the LORD hath given you
        the land, and that your terror is fallen upon us, and that all
        the inhabitants of the land faint because of you.

002:010 For we have heard how the LORD dried up the water of the Red
        sea for you, when ye came out of Egypt; and what ye did unto
        the two kings of the Amorites, that were on the other side
        Jordan, Sihon and Og, whom ye utterly destroyed.

002:011 And as soon as we had heard these things, our hearts did melt,
        neither did there remain any more courage in any man, because
        of you: for the LORD your God, he is God in heaven above, and
        in earth beneath.

002:012 Now therefore, I pray you, swear unto me by the LORD, since I
        have shewed you kindness, that ye will also shew kindness unto
        my father's house, and give me a true token:

002:013 And that ye will save alive my father, and my mother, and my
        brethren, and my sisters, and all that they have, and deliver
        our lives from death.

002:014 And the men answered her, Our life for yours, if ye utter not
        this our business. And it shall be, when the LORD hath given
        us the land, that we will deal kindly and truly with thee.

002:015 Then she let them down by a cord through the window: for her
        house was upon the town wall, and she dwelt upon the wall.

002:016 And she said unto them, Get you to the mountain, lest the
        pursuers meet you; and hide yourselves there three days, until
        the pursuers be returned: and afterward may ye go your way.

002:017 And the men said unto her, We will be blameless of this thine
        oath which thou hast made us swear.

002:018 Behold, when we come into the land, thou shalt bind this line
        of scarlet thread in the window which thou didst let us down
        by: and thou shalt bring thy father, and thy mother, and thy
        brethren, and all thy father's household, home unto thee.

002:019 And it shall be, that whosoever shall go out of the doors of
        thy house into the street, his blood shall be upon his head,
        and we will be guiltless: and whosoever shall be with thee in
        the house, his blood shall be on our head, if any hand be upon
        him.

002:020 And if thou utter this our business, then we will be quit of
        thine oath which thou hast made us to swear.

002:021 And she said, According unto your words, so be it. And she
        sent them away, and they departed: and she bound the scarlet
        line in the window.

002:022 And they went, and came unto the mountain, and abode there
        three days, until the pursuers were returned: and the pursuers
        sought them throughout all the way, but found them not.

002:023 So the two men returned, and descended from the mountain, and
        passed over, and came to Joshua the son of Nun, and told him
        all things that befell them:

002:024 And they said unto Joshua, Truly the LORD hath delivered into
        our hands all the land; for even all the inhabitants of the
        country do faint because of us.

003:001 And Joshua rose early in the morning; and they removed from
        Shittim, and came to Jordan, he and all the children of
        Israel, and lodged there before they passed over.

003:002 And it came to pass after three days, that the officers went
        through the host;

003:003 And they commanded the people, saying, When ye see the ark of
        the covenant of the LORD your God, and the priests the Levites
        bearing it, then ye shall remove from your place, and go after
        it.

003:004 Yet there shall be a space between you and it, about two
        thousand cubits by measure: come not near unto it, that ye may
        know the way by which ye must go: for ye have not passed this
        way heretofore.

003:005 And Joshua said unto the people, Sanctify yourselves: for to
        morrow the LORD will do wonders among you.

003:006 And Joshua spake unto the priests, saying, Take up the ark of
        the covenant, and pass over before the people. And they took
        up the ark of the covenant, and went before the people.

003:007 And the LORD said unto Joshua, This day will I begin to
        magnify thee in the sight of all Israel, that they may know
        that, as I was with Moses, so I will be with thee.

003:008 And thou shalt command the priests that bear the ark of the
        covenant, saying, When ye are come to the brink of the water
        of Jordan, ye shall stand still in Jordan.

003:009 And Joshua said unto the children of Israel, Come hither, and
        hear the words of the LORD your God.

003:010 And Joshua said, Hereby ye shall know that the living God is
        among you, and that he will without fail drive out from before
        you the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the Hivites, and the
        Perizzites, and the Girgashites, and the Amorites, and the
        Jebusites.

003:011 Behold, the ark of the covenant of the LORD of all the earth
        passeth over before you into Jordan.

003:012 Now therefore take you twelve men out of the tribes of Israel,
        out of every tribe a man.

003:013 And it shall come to pass, as soon as the soles of the feet of
        the priests that bear the ark of the LORD, the LORD of all the
        earth, shall rest in the waters of Jordan, that the waters of
        Jordan shall be cut off from the waters that come down from
        above; and they shall stand upon an heap.

003:014 And it came to pass, when the people removed from their tents,
        to pass over Jordan, and the priests bearing the ark of the
        covenant before the people;

003:015 And as they that bare the ark were come unto Jordan, and the
        feet of the priests that bare the ark were dipped in the brim
        of the water, (for Jordan overfloweth all his banks all the
        time of harvest,)

003:016 That the waters which came down from above stood and rose up
        upon an heap very far from the city Adam, that is beside
        Zaretan: and those that came down toward the sea of the plain,
        even the salt sea, failed, and were cut off: and the people
        passed over right against Jericho.

003:017 And the priests that bare the ark of the covenant of the LORD
        stood firm on dry ground in the midst of Jordan, and all the
        Israelites passed over on dry ground, until all the people
        were passed clean over Jordan.

004:001 And it came to pass, when all the people were clean passed
        over Jordan, that the LORD spake unto Joshua, saying,

004:002 Take you twelve men out of the people, out of every tribe a
        man,

004:003 And command ye them, saying, Take you hence out of the midst
        of Jordan, out of the place where the priests' feet stood
        firm, twelve stones, and ye shall carry them over with you,
        and leave them in the lodging place, where ye shall lodge this
        night.

004:004 Then Joshua called the twelve men, whom he had prepared of the
        children of Israel, out of every tribe a man:

004:005 And Joshua said unto them, Pass over before the ark of the
        LORD your God into the midst of Jordan, and take you up every
        man of you a stone upon his shoulder, according unto the
        number of the tribes of the children of Israel:

004:006 That this may be a sign among you, that when your children ask
        their fathers in time to come, saying, What mean ye by these
        stones?

004:007 Then ye shall answer them, That the waters of Jordan were cut
        off before the ark of the covenant of the LORD; when it passed
        over Jordan, the waters of Jordan were cut off: and these
        stones shall be for a memorial unto the children of Israel for
        ever.

004:008 And the children of Israel did so as Joshua commanded, and
        took up twelve stones out of the midst of Jordan, as the LORD
        spake unto Joshua, according to the number of the tribes of
        the children of Israel, and carried them over with them unto
        the place where they lodged, and laid them down there.

004:009 And Joshua set up twelve stones in the midst of Jordan, in the
        place where the feet of the priests which bare the ark of the
        covenant stood: and they are there unto this day.

004:010 For the priests which bare the ark stood in the midst of
        Jordan, until everything was finished that the LORD commanded
        Joshua to speak unto the people, according to all that Moses
        commanded Joshua: and the people hasted and passed over.

004:011 And it came to pass, when all the people were clean passed
        over, that the ark of the LORD passed over, and the priests,
        in the presence of the people.

004:012 And the children of Reuben, and the children of Gad, and half
        the tribe of Manasseh, passed over armed before the children
        of Israel, as Moses spake unto them:

004:013 About forty thousand prepared for war passed over before the
        LORD unto battle, to the plains of Jericho.

004:014 On that day the LORD magnified Joshua in the sight of all
        Israel; and they feared him, as they feared Moses, all the
        days of his life.

004:015 And the LORD spake unto Joshua, saying,

004:016 Command the priests that bear the ark of the testimony, that
        they come up out of Jordan.

004:017 Joshua therefore commanded the priests, saying, Come ye up out
        of Jordan.

004:018 And it came to pass, when the priests that bare the ark of the
        covenant of the LORD were come up out of the midst of Jordan,
        and the soles of the priests' feet were lifted up unto the dry
        land, that the waters of Jordan returned unto their place, and
        flowed over all his banks, as they did before.

004:019 And the people came up out of Jordan on the tenth day of the
        first month, and encamped in Gilgal, in the east border of
        Jericho.

004:020 And those twelve stones, which they took out of Jordan, did
        Joshua pitch in Gilgal.

004:021 And he spake unto the children of Israel, saying, When your
        children shall ask their fathers in time to come, saying, What
        mean these stones?

004:022 Then ye shall let your children know, saying, Israel came over
        this Jordan on dry land.

004:023 For the LORD your God dried up the waters of Jordan from
        before you, until ye were passed over, as the LORD your God
        did to the Red sea, which he dried up from before us, until we
        were gone over:

004:024 That all the people of the earth might know the hand of the
        LORD, that it is mighty: that ye might fear the LORD your God
        for ever.

005:001 And it came to pass, when all the kings of the Amorites, which
        were on the side of Jordan westward, and all the kings of the
        Canaanites, which were by the sea, heard that the LORD had
        dried up the waters of Jordan from before the children of
        Israel, until we were passed over, that their heart melted,
        neither was there spirit in them any more, because of the
        children of Israel.

005:002 At that time the LORD said unto Joshua, Make thee sharp
        knives, and circumcise again the children of Israel the second
        time.

005:003 And Joshua made him sharp knives, and circumcised the children
        of Israel at the hill of the foreskins.

005:004 And this is the cause why Joshua did circumcise: All the
        people that came out of Egypt, that were males, even all the
        men of war, died in the wilderness by the way, after they came
        out of Egypt.

005:005 Now all the people that came out were circumcised: but all the
        people that were born in the wilderness by the way as they
        came forth out of Egypt, them they had not circumcised.

005:006 For the children of Israel walked forty years in the
        wilderness, till all the people that were men of war, which
        came out of Egypt, were consumed, because they obeyed not the
        voice of the LORD: unto whom the LORD sware that he would not
        shew them the land, which the LORD sware unto their fathers
        that he would give us, a land that floweth with milk and
        honey.

005:007 And their children, whom he raised up in their stead, them
        Joshua circumcised: for they were uncircumcised, because they
        had not circumcised them by the way.

005:008 And it came to pass, when they had done circumcising all the
        people, that they abode in their places in the camp, till they
        were whole.

005:009 And the LORD said unto Joshua, This day have I rolled away the
        reproach of Egypt from off you. Wherefore the name of the
        place is called Gilgal unto this day.

005:010 And the children of Israel encamped in Gilgal, and kept the
        passover on the fourteenth day of the month at even in the
        plains of Jericho.

005:011 And they did eat of the old corn of the land on the morrow
        after the passover, unleavened cakes, and parched corn in the
        selfsame day.

005:012 And the manna ceased on the morrow after they had eaten of the
        old corn of the land; neither had the children of Israel manna
        any more; but they did eat of the fruit of the land of Canaan
        that year.

005:013 And it came to pass, when Joshua was by Jericho, that he
        lifted up his eyes and looked, and, behold, there stood a man
        over against him with his sword drawn in his hand: and Joshua
        went unto him, and said unto him, Art thou for us, or for our
        adversaries?

005:014 And he said, Nay; but as captain of the host of the LORD am I
        now come. And Joshua fell on his face to the earth, and did
        worship, and said unto him, What saith my Lord unto his
        servant?

005:015 And the captain of the LORD's host said unto Joshua, Loose thy
        shoe from off thy foot; for the place whereon thou standest is
        holy. And Joshua did so.

006:001 Now Jericho was straitly shut up because of the children of
        Israel: none went out, and none came in.

006:002 And the LORD said unto Joshua, See, I have given into thine
        hand Jericho, and the king thereof, and the mighty men of
        valour.

006:003 And ye shall compass the city, all ye men of war, and go round
        about the city once. Thus shalt thou do six days.

006:004 And seven priests shall bear before the ark seven trumpets of
        rams' horns: and the seventh day ye shall compass the city
        seven times, and the priests shall blow with the trumpets.

006:005 And it shall come to pass, that when they make a long blast
        with the ram's horn, and when ye hear the sound of the
        trumpet, all the people shall shout with a great shout; and
        the wall of the city shall fall down flat, and the people
        shall ascend up every man straight before him.

006:006 And Joshua the son of Nun called the priests, and said unto
        them, Take up the ark of the covenant, and let seven priests
        bear seven trumpets of rams' horns before the ark of the LORD.

006:007 And he said unto the people, Pass on, and compass the city,
        and let him that is armed pass on before the ark of the LORD.

006:008 And it came to pass, when Joshua had spoken unto the people,
        that the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of rams'
        horns passed on before the LORD, and blew with the trumpets:
        and the ark of the covenant of the LORD followed them.

006:009 And the armed men went before the priests that blew with the
        trumpets, and the rereward came after the ark, the priests
        going on, and blowing with the trumpets.

006:010 And Joshua had commanded the people, saying, Ye shall not
        shout, nor make any noise with your voice, neither shall any
        word proceed out of your mouth, until the day I bid you shout;
        then shall ye shout.

006:011 So the ark of the LORD compassed the city, going about it
        once: and they came into the camp, and lodged in the camp.

006:012 And Joshua rose early in the morning, and the priests took up
        the ark of the LORD.

006:013 And seven priests bearing seven trumpets of rams' horns before
        the ark of the LORD went on continually, and blew with the
        trumpets: and the armed men went before them; but the rereward
        came after the ark of the LORD, the priests going on, and
        blowing with the trumpets.

006:014 And the second day they compassed the city once, and returned
        into the camp: so they did six days.

006:015 And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they rose early
        about the dawning of the day, and compassed the city after the
        same manner seven times: only on that day they compassed the
        city seven times.

006:016 And it came to pass at the seventh time, when the priests blew
        with the trumpets, Joshua said unto the people, Shout; for the
        LORD hath given you the city.

006:017 And the city shall be accursed, even it, and all that are
        therein, to the LORD: only Rahab the harlot shall live, she
        and all that are with her in the house, because she hid the
        messengers that we sent.

006:018 And ye, in any wise keep yourselves from the accursed thing,
        lest ye make yourselves accursed, when ye take of the accursed
        thing, and make the camp of Israel a curse, and trouble it.

006:019 But all the silver, and gold, and vessels of brass and iron,
        are consecrated unto the LORD: they shall come into the
        treasury of the LORD.

006:020 So the people shouted when the priests blew with the trumpets:
        and it came to pass, when the people heard the sound of the
        trumpet, and the people shouted with a great shout, that the
        wall fell down flat, so that the people went up into the city,
        every man straight before him, and they took the city.

006:021 And they utterly destroyed all that was in the city, both man
        and woman, young and old, and ox, and sheep, and ass, with the
        edge of the sword.

006:022 But Joshua had said unto the two men that had spied out the
        country, Go into the harlot's house, and bring out thence the
        woman, and all that she hath, as ye sware unto her.

006:023 And the young men that were spies went in, and brought out
        Rahab, and her father, and her mother, and her brethren, and
        all that she had; and they brought out all her kindred, and
        left them without the camp of Israel.

006:024 And they burnt the city with fire, and all that was therein:
        only the silver, and the gold, and the vessels of brass and of
        iron, they put into the treasury of the house of the LORD.

006:025 And Joshua saved Rahab the harlot alive, and her father's
        household, and all that she had; and she dwelleth in Israel
        even unto this day; because she hid the messengers, which
        Joshua sent to spy out Jericho.

006:026 And Joshua adjured them at that time, saying, Cursed be the
        man before the LORD, that riseth up and buildeth this city
        Jericho: he shall lay the foundation thereof in his firstborn,
        and in his youngest son shall he set up the gates of it.

006:027 So the LORD was with Joshua; and his fame was noised
        throughout all the country.

007:001 But the children of Israel committed a trespass in the
        accursed thing: for Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi,
        the son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, took of the accursed
        thing: and the anger of the LORD was kindled against the
        children of Israel.

007:002 And Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which is beside
        Bethaven, on the east of Bethel, and spake unto them, saying,
        Go up and view the country. And the men went up and viewed Ai.

007:003 And they returned to Joshua, and said unto him, Let not all
        the people go up; but let about two or three thousand men go
        up and smite Ai; and make not all the people to labour
        thither; for they are but few.

007:004 So there went up thither of the people about three thousand
        men: and they fled before the men of Ai.

007:005 And the men of Ai smote of them about thirty and six men: for
        they chased them from before the gate even unto Shebarim, and
        smote them in the going down: wherefore the hearts of the
        people melted, and became as water.

007:006 And Joshua rent his clothes, and fell to the earth upon his
        face before the ark of the LORD until the eventide, he and the
        elders of Israel, and put dust upon their heads.

007:007 And Joshua said, Alas, O LORD God, wherefore hast thou at all
        brought this people over Jordan, to deliver us into the hand
        of the Amorites, to destroy us? would to God we had been
        content, and dwelt on the other side Jordan!

007:008 O LORD, what shall I say, when Israel turneth their backs
        before their enemies!

007:009 For the Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land shall
        hear of it, and shall environ us round, and cut off our name
        from the earth: and what wilt thou do unto thy great name?

007:010 And the LORD said unto Joshua, Get thee up; wherefore liest
        thou thus upon thy face?

007:011 Israel hath sinned, and they have also transgressed my
        covenant which I commanded them: for they have even taken of
        the accursed thing, and have also stolen, and dissembled also,
        and they have put it even among their own stuff.

007:012 Therefore the children of Israel could not stand before their
        enemies, but turned their backs before their enemies, because
        they were accursed: neither will I be with you any more,
        except ye destroy the accursed from among you.

007:013 Up, sanctify the people, and say, Sanctify yourselves against
        to morrow: for thus saith the LORD God of Israel, There is an
        accursed thing in the midst of thee, O Israel: thou canst not
        stand before thine enemies, until ye take away the accursed
        thing from among you.

007:014 In the morning therefore ye shall be brought according to your
        tribes: and it shall be, that the tribe which the LORD taketh
        shall come according to the families thereof; and the family
        which the LORD shall take shall come by households; and the
        household which the LORD shall take shall come man by man.

007:015 And it shall be, that he that is taken with the accursed thing
        shall be burnt with fire, he and all that he hath: because he
        hath transgressed the covenant of the LORD, and because he
        hath wrought folly in Israel.

007:016 So Joshua rose up early in the morning, and brought Israel by
        their tribes; and the tribe of Judah was taken:

007:017 And he brought the family of Judah; and he took the family of
        the Zarhites: and he brought the family of the Zarhites man by
        man; and Zabdi was taken:

007:018 And he brought his household man by man; and Achan, the son of
        Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, of the tribe of
        Judah, was taken.

007:019 And Joshua said unto Achan, My son, give, I pray thee, glory
        to the LORD God of Israel, and make confession unto him; and
        tell me now what thou hast done; hide it not from me.

007:020 And Achan answered Joshua, and said, Indeed I have sinned
        against the LORD God of Israel, and thus and thus have I done:

007:021 When I saw among the spoils a goodly Babylonish garment, and
        two hundred shekels of silver, and a wedge of gold of fifty
        shekels weight, then I coveted them, and took them; and,
        behold, they are hid in the earth in the midst of my tent, and
        the silver under it.

007:022 So Joshua sent messengers, and they ran unto the tent; and,
        behold, it was hid in his tent, and the silver under it.

007:023 And they took them out of the midst of the tent, and brought
        them unto Joshua, and unto all the children of Israel, and
        laid them out before the LORD.

007:024 And Joshua, and all Israel with him, took Achan the son of
        Zerah, and the silver, and the garment, and the wedge of gold,
        and his sons, and his daughters, and his oxen, and his asses,
        and his sheep, and his tent, and all that he had: and they
        brought them unto the valley of Achor.

007:025 And Joshua said, Why hast thou troubled us? the LORD shall
        trouble thee this day. And all Israel stoned him with stones,
        and burned them with fire, after they had stoned them with
        stones.

007:026 And they raised over him a great heap of stones unto this day.
        So the LORD turned from the fierceness of his anger. Wherefore
        the name of that place was called, The valley of Achor, unto
        this day.

008:001 And the LORD said unto Joshua, Fear not, neither be thou
        dismayed: take all the people of war with thee, and arise, go
        up to Ai: see, I have given into thy hand the king of Ai, and
        his people, and his city, and his land:

008:002 And thou shalt do to Ai and her king as thou didst unto
        Jericho and her king: only the spoil thereof, and the cattle
        thereof, shall ye take for a prey unto yourselves: lay thee an
        ambush for the city behind it.

008:003 So Joshua arose, and all the people of war, to go up against
        Ai: and Joshua chose out thirty thousand mighty men of valour,
        and sent them away by night.

008:004 And he commanded them, saying, Behold, ye shall lie in wait
        against the city, even behind the city: go not very far from
        the city, but be ye all ready:

008:005 And I, and all the people that are with me, will approach unto
        the city: and it shall come to pass, when they come out
        against us, as at the first, that we will flee before them,

008:006 (For they will come out after us) till we have drawn them from
        the city; for they will say, They flee before us, as at the
        first: therefore we will flee before them.

008:007 Then ye shall rise up from the ambush, and seize upon the
        city: for the LORD your God will deliver it into your hand.

008:008 And it shall be, when ye have taken the city, that ye shall
        set the city on fire: according to the commandment of the LORD
        shall ye do. See, I have commanded you.

008:009 Joshua therefore sent them forth: and they went to lie in
        ambush, and abode between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of
        Ai: but Joshua lodged that night among the people.

008:010 And Joshua rose up early in the morning, and numbered the
        people, and went up, he and the elders of Israel, before the
        people to Ai.

008:011 And all the people, even the people of war that were with him,
        went up, and drew nigh, and came before the city, and pitched
        on the north side of Ai: now there was a valley between them
        and Ai.

008:012 And he took about five thousand men, and set them to lie in
        ambush between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of the city.

008:013 And when they had set the people, even all the host that was
        on the north of the city, and their liers in wait on the west
        of the city, Joshua went that night into the midst of the
        valley.

008:014 And it came to pass, when the king of Ai saw it, that they
        hasted and rose up early, and the men of the city went out
        against Israel to battle, he and all his people, at a time
        appointed, before the plain; but he wist not that there were
        liers in ambush against him behind the city.

008:015 And Joshua and all Israel made as if they were beaten before
        them, and fled by the way of the wilderness.

008:016 And all the people that were in Ai were called together to
        pursue after them: and they pursued after Joshua, and were
        drawn away from the city.

008:017 And there was not a man left in Ai or Bethel, that went not
        out after Israel: and they left the city open, and pursued
        after Israel.

008:018 And the LORD said unto Joshua, Stretch out the spear that is
        in thy hand toward Ai; for I will give it into thine hand. And
        Joshua stretched out the spear that he had in his hand toward
        the city.

008:019 And the ambush arose quickly out of their place, and they ran
        as soon as he had stretched out his hand: and they entered
        into the city, and took it, and hasted and set the city on
        fire.

008:020 And when the men of Ai looked behind them, they saw, and,
        behold, the smoke of the city ascended up to heaven, and they
        had no power to flee this way or that way: and the people that
        fled to the wilderness turned back upon the pursuers.

008:021 And when Joshua and all Israel saw that the ambush had taken
        the city, and that the smoke of the city ascended, then they
        turned again, and slew the men of Ai.

008:022 And the other issued out of the city against them; so they
        were in the midst of Israel, some on this side, and some on
        that side: and they smote them, so that they let none of them
        remain or escape.

008:023 And the king of Ai they took alive, and brought him to Joshua.

008:024 And it came to pass, when Israel had made an end of slaying
        all the inhabitants of Ai in the field, in the wilderness
        wherein they chased them, and when they were all fallen on the
        edge of the sword, until they were consumed, that all the
        Israelites returned unto Ai, and smote it with the edge of the
        sword.

008:025 And so it was, that all that fell that day, both of men and
        women, were twelve thousand, even all the men of Ai.

008:026 For Joshua drew not his hand back, wherewith he stretched out
        the spear, until he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants
        of Ai.

008:027 Only the cattle and the spoil of that city Israel took for a
        prey unto themselves, according unto the word of the LORD
        which he commanded Joshua.

008:028 And Joshua burnt Ai, and made it an heap for ever, even a
        desolation unto this day.

008:029 And the king of Ai he hanged on a tree until eventide: and as
        soon as the sun was down, Joshua commanded that they should
        take his carcase down from the tree, and cast it at the
        entering of the gate of the city, and raise thereon a great
        heap of stones, that remaineth unto this day.

008:030 Then Joshua built an altar unto the LORD God of Israel in
        mount Ebal,

008:031 As Moses the servant of the LORD commanded the children of
        Israel, as it is written in the book of the law of Moses, an
        altar of whole stones, over which no man hath lift up any
        iron: and they offered thereon burnt offerings unto the LORD,
        and sacrificed peace offerings.

008:032 And he wrote there upon the stones a copy of the law of Moses,
        which he wrote in the presence of the children of Israel.

008:033 And all Israel, and their elders, and officers, and their
        judges, stood on this side the ark and on that side before the
        priests the Levites, which bare the ark of the covenant of the
        LORD, as well the stranger, as he that was born among them;
        half of them over against mount Gerizim, and half of them over
        against mount Ebal; as Moses the servant of the LORD had
        commanded before, that they should bless the people of Israel.

008:034 And afterward he read all the words of the law, the blessings
        and cursings, according to all that is written in the book of
        the law.

008:035 There was not a word of all that Moses commanded, which Joshua
        read not before all the congregation of Israel, with the
        women, and the little ones, and the strangers that were
        conversant among them.

009:001 And it came to pass, when all the kings which were on this
        side Jordan, in the hills, and in the valleys, and in all the
        coasts of the great sea over against Lebanon, the Hittite, and
        the Amorite, the Canaanite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the
        Jebusite, heard thereof;

009:002 That they gathered themselves together, to fight with Joshua
        and with Israel, with one accord.

009:003 And when the inhabitants of Gibeon heard what Joshua had done
        unto Jericho and to Ai,

009:004 They did work wilily, and went and made as if they had been
        ambassadors, and took old sacks upon their asses, and wine
        bottles, old, and rent, and bound up;

009:005 And old shoes and clouted upon their feet, and old garments
        upon them; and all the bread of their provision was dry and
        mouldy.

009:006 And they went to Joshua unto the camp at Gilgal, and said unto
        him, and to the men of Israel, We be come from a far country:
        now therefore make ye a league with us.

009:007 And the men of Israel said unto the Hivites, Peradventure ye
        dwell among us; and how shall we make a league with you?

009:008 And they said unto Joshua, We are thy servants. And Joshua
        said unto them, Who are ye? and from whence come ye?

009:009 And they said unto him, From a very far country thy servants
        are come because of the name of the LORD thy God: for we have
        heard the fame of him, and all that he did in Egypt,

009:010 And all that he did to the two kings of the Amorites, that
        were beyond Jordan, to Sihon king of Heshbon, and to Og king
        of Bashan, which was at Ashtaroth.

009:011 Wherefore our elders and all the inhabitants of our country
        spake to us, saying, Take victuals with you for the journey,
        and go to meet them, and say unto them, We are your servants:
        therefore now make ye a league with us.

009:012 This our bread we took hot for our provision out of our houses
        on the day we came forth to go unto you; but now, behold, it
        is dry, and it is mouldy:

009:013 And these bottles of wine, which we filled, were new; and,
        behold, they be rent: and these our garments and our shoes are
        become old by reason of the very long journey.

009:014 And the men took of their victuals, and asked not counsel at
        the mouth of the LORD.

009:015 And Joshua made peace with them, and made a league with them,
        to let them live: and the princes of the congregation sware
        unto them.

009:016 And it came to pass at the end of three days after they had
        made a league with them, that they heard that they were their
        neighbours, and that they dwelt among them.

009:017 And the children of Israel journeyed, and came unto their
        cities on the third day. Now their cities were Gibeon, and
        Chephirah, and Beeroth, and Kirjathjearim.

009:018 And the children of Israel smote them not, because the princes
        of the congregation had sworn unto them by the LORD God of
        Israel. And all the congregation murmured against the princes.

009:019 But all the princes said unto all the congregation, We have
        sworn unto them by the LORD God of Israel: now therefore we
        may not touch them.

009:020 This we will do to them; we will even let them live, lest
        wrath be upon us, because of the oath which we sware unto
        them.

009:021 And the princes said unto them, Let them live; but let them be
        hewers of wood and drawers of water unto all the congregation;
        as the princes had promised them.

009:022 And Joshua called for them, and he spake unto them, saying,
        Wherefore have ye beguiled us, saying, We are very far from
        you; when ye dwell among us?

009:023 Now therefore ye are cursed, and there shall none of you be
        freed from being bondmen, and hewers of wood and drawers of
        water for the house of my God.

009:024 And they answered Joshua, and said, Because it was certainly
        told thy servants, how that the LORD thy God commanded his
        servant Moses to give you all the land, and to destroy all the
        inhabitants of the land from before you, therefore we were
        sore afraid of our lives because of you, and have done this
        thing.

009:025 And now, behold, we are in thine hand: as it seemeth good and
        right unto thee to do unto us, do.

009:026 And so did he unto them, and delivered them out of the hand of
        the children of Israel, that they slew them not.

009:027 And Joshua made them that day hewers of wood and drawers of
        water for the congregation, and for the altar of the LORD,
        even unto this day, in the place which he should choose.

010:001 Now it came to pass, when Adonizedec king of Jerusalem had
        heard how Joshua had taken Ai, and had utterly destroyed it;
        as he had done to Jericho and her king, so he had done to Ai
        and her king; and how the inhabitants of Gibeon had made peace
        with Israel, and were among them;

010:002 That they feared greatly, because Gibeon was a great city, as
        one of the royal cities, and because it was greater than Ai,
        and all the men thereof were mighty.

010:003 Wherefore Adonizedec king of Jerusalem, sent unto Hoham king
        of Hebron, and unto Piram king of Jarmuth, and unto Japhia
        king of Lachish, and unto Debir king of Eglon, saying,

010:004 Come up unto me, and help me, that we may smite Gibeon: for it
        hath made peace with Joshua and with the children of Israel.

010:005 Therefore the five kings of the Amorites, the king of
        Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king
        of Lachish, the king of Eglon, gathered themselves together,
        and went up, they and all their hosts, and encamped before
        Gibeon, and made war against it.

010:006 And the men of Gibeon sent unto Joshua to the camp to Gilgal,
        saying, Slack not thy hand from thy servants; come up to us
        quickly, and save us, and help us: for all the kings of the
        Amorites that dwell in the mountains are gathered together
        against us.

010:007 So Joshua ascended from Gilgal, he, and all the people of war
        with him, and all the mighty men of valour.

010:008 And the LORD said unto Joshua, Fear them not: for I have
        delivered them into thine hand; there shall not a man of them
        stand before thee.

010:009 Joshua therefore came unto them suddenly, and went up from
        Gilgal all night.

010:010 And the LORD discomfited them before Israel, and slew them
        with a great slaughter at Gibeon, and chased them along the
        way that goeth up to Bethhoron, and smote them to Azekah, and
        unto Makkedah.

010:011 And it came to pass, as they fled from before Israel, and were
        in the going down to Bethhoron, that the LORD cast down great
        stones from heaven upon them unto Azekah, and they died: they
        were more which died with hailstones than they whom the
        children of Israel slew with the sword.

010:012 Then spake Joshua to the LORD in the day when the LORD
        delivered up the Amorites before the children of Israel, and
        he said in the sight of Israel, Sun, stand thou still upon
        Gibeon; and thou, Moon, in the valley of Ajalon.

010:013 And the sun stood still, and the moon stayed, until the people
        had avenged themselves upon their enemies. Is not this written
        in the book of Jasher? So the sun stood still in the midst of
        heaven, and hasted not to go down about a whole day.

010:014 And there was no day like that before it or after it, that the
        LORD hearkened unto the voice of a man: for the LORD fought
        for Israel.

010:015 And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, unto the camp to
        Gilgal.

010:016 But these five kings fled, and hid themselves in a cave at
        Makkedah.

010:017 And it was told Joshua, saying, The five kings are found hid
        in a cave at Makkedah.

010:018 And Joshua said, Roll great stones upon the mouth of the cave,
        and set men by it for to keep them:

010:019 And stay ye not, but pursue after your enemies, and smite the
        hindmost of them; suffer them not to enter into their cities:
        for the LORD your God hath delivered them into your hand.

010:020 And it came to pass, when Joshua and the children of Israel
        had made an end of slaying them with a very great slaughter,
        till they were consumed, that the rest which remained of them
        entered into fenced cities.

010:021 And all the people returned to the camp to Joshua at Makkedah
        in peace: none moved his tongue against any of the children of
        Israel.

010:022 Then said Joshua, Open the mouth of the cave, and bring out
        those five kings unto me out of the cave.

010:023 And they did so, and brought forth those five kings unto him
        out of the cave, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron,
        the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, and the king of
        Eglon.

010:024 And it came to pass, when they brought out those kings unto
        Joshua, that Joshua called for all the men of Israel, and said
        unto the captains of the men of war which went with him, Come
        near, put your feet upon the necks of these kings. And they
        came near, and put their feet upon the necks of them.

010:025 And Joshua said unto them, Fear not, nor be dismayed, be
        strong and of good courage: for thus shall the LORD do to all
        your enemies against whom ye fight.

010:026 And afterward Joshua smote them, and slew them, and hanged
        them on five trees: and they were hanging upon the trees until
        the evening.

010:027 And it came to pass at the time of the going down of the sun,
        that Joshua commanded, and they took them down off the trees,
        and cast them into the cave wherein they had been hid, and
        laid great stones in the cave's mouth, which remain until this
        very day.

010:028 And that day Joshua took Makkedah, and smote it with the edge
        of the sword, and the king thereof he utterly destroyed, them,
        and all the souls that were therein; he let none remain: and
        he did to the king of Makkedah as he did unto the king of
        Jericho.

010:029 Then Joshua passed from Makkedah, and all Israel with him,
        unto Libnah, and fought against Libnah:

010:030 And the LORD delivered it also, and the king thereof, into the
        hand of Israel; and he smote it with the edge of the sword,
        and all the souls that were therein; he let none remain in it;
        but did unto the king thereof as he did unto the king of
        Jericho.

010:031 And Joshua passed from Libnah, and all Israel with him, unto
        Lachish, and encamped against it, and fought against it:

010:032 And the LORD delivered Lachish into the hand of Israel, which
        took it on the second day, and smote it with the edge of the
        sword, and all the souls that were therein, according to all
        that he had done to Libnah.

010:033 Then Horam king of Gezer came up to help Lachish; and Joshua
        smote him and his people, until he had left him none
        remaining.

010:034 And from Lachish Joshua passed unto Eglon, and all Israel with
        him; and they encamped against it, and fought against it:

010:035 And they took it on that day, and smote it with the edge of
        the sword, and all the souls that were therein he utterly
        destroyed that day, according to all that he had done to
        Lachish.

010:036 And Joshua went up from Eglon, and all Israel with him, unto
        Hebron; and they fought against it:

010:037 And they took it, and smote it with the edge of the sword, and
        the king thereof, and all the cities thereof, and all the
        souls that were therein; he left none remaining, according to
        all that he had done to Eglon; but destroyed it utterly, and
        all the souls that were therein.

010:038 And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, to Debir; and
        fought against it:

010:039 And he took it, and the king thereof, and all the cities
        thereof; and they smote them with the edge of the sword, and
        utterly destroyed all the souls that were therein; he left
        none remaining: as he had done to Hebron, so he did to Debir,
        and to the king thereof; as he had done also to Libnah, and to
        her king.

010:040 So Joshua smote all the country of the hills, and of the
        south, and of the vale, and of the springs, and all their
        kings: he left none remaining, but utterly destroyed all that
        breathed, as the LORD God of Israel commanded.

010:041 And Joshua smote them from Kadeshbarnea even unto Gaza, and
        all the country of Goshen, even unto Gibeon.

010:042 And all these kings and their land did Joshua take at one
        time, because the LORD God of Israel fought for Israel.

010:043 And Joshua returned, and all Israel with him, unto the camp to
        Gilgal.

011:001 And it came to pass, when Jabin king of Hazor had heard those
        things, that he sent to Jobab king of Madon, and to the king
        of Shimron, and to the king of Achshaph,

011:002 And to the kings that were on the north of the mountains, and
        of the plains south of Chinneroth, and in the valley, and in
        the borders of Dor on the west,

011:003 And to the Canaanite on the east and on the west, and to the
        Amorite, and the Hittite, and the Perizzite, and the Jebusite
        in the mountains, and to the Hivite under Hermon in the land
        of Mizpeh.

011:004 And they went out, they and all their hosts with them, much
        people, even as the sand that is upon the sea shore in
        multitude, with horses and chariots very many.

011:005 And when all these kings were met together, they came and
        pitched together at the waters of Merom, to fight against
        Israel.

011:006 And the LORD said unto Joshua, Be not afraid because of them:
        for to morrow about this time will I deliver them up all slain
        before Israel: thou shalt hough their horses, and burn their
        chariots with fire.

011:007 So Joshua came, and all the people of war with him, against
        them by the waters of Merom suddenly; and they fell upon them.

011:008 And the LORD delivered them into the hand of Israel, who smote
        them, and chased them unto great Zidon, and unto
        Misrephothmaim, and unto the valley of Mizpeh eastward; and
        they smote them, until they left them none remaining.

011:009 And Joshua did unto them as the LORD bade him: he houghed
        their horses, and burnt their chariots with fire.

011:010 And Joshua at that time turned back, and took Hazor, and smote
        the king thereof with the sword: for Hazor beforetime was the
        head of all those kingdoms.

011:011 And they smote all the souls that were therein with the edge
        of the sword, utterly destroying them: there was not any left
        to breathe: and he burnt Hazor with fire.

011:012 And all the cities of those kings, and all the kings of them,
        did Joshua take, and smote them with the edge of the sword,
        and he utterly destroyed them, as Moses the servant of the
        LORD commanded.

011:013 But as for the cities that stood still in their strength,
        Israel burned none of them, save Hazor only; that did Joshua
        burn.

011:014 And all the spoil of these cities, and the cattle, the
        children of Israel took for a prey unto themselves; but every
        man they smote with the edge of the sword, until they had
        destroyed them, neither left they any to breathe.

011:015 As the LORD commanded Moses his servant, so did Moses command
        Joshua, and so did Joshua; he left nothing undone of all that
        the LORD commanded Moses.

011:016 So Joshua took all that land, the hills, and all the south
        country, and all the land of Goshen, and the valley, and the
        plain, and the mountain of Israel, and the valley of the same;

011:017 Even from the mount Halak, that goeth up to Seir, even unto
        Baalgad in the valley of Lebanon under mount Hermon: and all
        their kings he took, and smote them, and slew them.

011:018 Joshua made war a long time with all those kings.

011:019 There was not a city that made peace with the children of
        Israel, save the Hivites the inhabitants of Gibeon: all other
        they took in battle.

011:020 For it was of the LORD to harden their hearts, that they
        should come against Israel in battle, that he might destroy
        them utterly, and that they might have no favour, but that he
        might destroy them, as the LORD commanded Moses.

011:021 And at that time came Joshua, and cut off the Anakims from the
        mountains, from Hebron, from Debir, from Anab, and from all
        the mountains of Judah, and from all the mountains of Israel:
        Joshua destroyed them utterly with their cities.

011:022 There was none of the Anakims left in the land of the children
        of Israel: only in Gaza, in Gath, and in Ashdod, there
        remained.

011:023 So Joshua took the whole land, according to all that the LORD
        said unto Moses; and Joshua gave it for an inheritance unto
        Israel according to their divisions by their tribes. And the
        land rested from war.

012:001 Now these are the kings of the land, which the children of
        Israel smote, and possessed their land on the other side
        Jordan toward the rising of the sun, from the river Arnon unto
        mount Hermon, and all the plain on the east:

012:002 Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt in Heshbon, and ruled
        from Aroer, which is upon the bank of the river Arnon, and
        from the middle of the river, and from half Gilead, even unto
        the river Jabbok, which is the border of the children of
        Ammon;

012:003 And from the plain to the sea of Chinneroth on the east, and
        unto the sea of the plain, even the salt sea on the east, the
        way to Bethjeshimoth; and from the south, under Ashdothpisgah:

012:004 And the coast of Og king of Bashan, which was of the remnant
        of the giants, that dwelt at Ashtaroth and at Edrei,

012:005 And reigned in mount Hermon, and in Salcah, and in all Bashan,
        unto the border of the Geshurites and the Maachathites, and
        half Gilead, the border of Sihon king of Heshbon.

012:006 Them did Moses the servant of the LORD and the children of
        Israel smite: and Moses the servant of the LORD gave it for a
        possession unto the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the half
        tribe of Manasseh.

012:007 And these are the kings of the country which Joshua and the
        children of Israel smote on this side Jordan on the west, from
        Baalgad in the valley of Lebanon even unto the mount Halak,
        that goeth up to Seir; which Joshua gave unto the tribes of
        Israel for a possession according to their divisions;

012:008 In the mountains, and in the valleys, and in the plains, and
        in the springs, and in the wilderness, and in the south
        country; the Hittites, the Amorites, and the Canaanites, the
        Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites:

012:009 The king of Jericho, one; the king of Ai, which is beside
        Bethel, one;

012:010 The king of Jerusalem, one; the king of Hebron, one;

012:011 The king of Jarmuth, one; the king of Lachish, one;

012:012 The king of Eglon, one; the king of Gezer, one;

012:013 The king of Debir, one; the king of Geder, one;

012:014 The king of Hormah, one; the king of Arad, one;

012:015 The king of Libnah, one; the king of Adullam, one;

012:016 The king of Makkedah, one; the king of Bethel, one;

012:017 The king of Tappuah, one; the king of Hepher, one;

012:018 The king of Aphek, one; the king of Lasharon, one;

012:019 The king of Madon, one; the king of Hazor, one;

012:020 The king of Shimronmeron, one; the king of Achshaph, one;

012:021 The king of Taanach, one; the king of Megiddo, one;

012:022 The king of Kedesh, one; the king of Jokneam of Carmel, one;

012:023 The king of Dor in the coast of Dor, one; the king of the
        nations of Gilgal, one;

012:024 The king of Tirzah, one: all the kings thirty and one.

013:001 Now Joshua was old and stricken in years; and the LORD said
        unto him, Thou art old and stricken in years, and there
        remaineth yet very much land to be possessed.

013:002 This is the land that yet remaineth: all the borders of the
        Philistines, and all Geshuri,

013:003 From Sihor, which is before Egypt, even unto the borders of
        Ekron northward, which is counted to the Canaanite: five lords
        of the Philistines; the Gazathites, and the Ashdothites, the
        Eshkalonites, the Gittites, and the Ekronites; also the
        Avites:

013:004 From the south, all the land of the Canaanites, and Mearah
        that is beside the Sidonians unto Aphek, to the borders of the
        Amorites:

013:005 And the land of the Giblites, and all Lebanon, toward the
        sunrising, from Baalgad under mount Hermon unto the entering
        into Hamath.

013:006 All the inhabitants of the hill country from Lebanon unto
        Misrephothmaim, and all the Sidonians, them will I drive out
        from before the children of Israel: only divide thou it by lot
        unto the Israelites for an inheritance, as I have commanded
        thee.

013:007 Now therefore divide this land for an inheritance unto the
        nine tribes, and the half tribe of Manasseh,

013:008 With whom the Reubenites and the Gadites have received their
        inheritance, which Moses gave them, beyond Jordan eastward,
        even as Moses the servant of the LORD gave them;

013:009 From Aroer, that is upon the bank of the river Arnon, and the
        city that is in the midst of the river, and all the plain of
        Medeba unto Dibon;

013:010 And all the cities of Sihon king of the Amorites, which
        reigned in Heshbon, unto the border of the children of Ammon;

013:011 And Gilead, and the border of the Geshurites and Maachathites,
        and all mount Hermon, and all Bashan unto Salcah;

013:012 All the kingdom of Og in Bashan, which reigned in Ashtaroth
        and in Edrei, who remained of the remnant of the giants: for
        these did Moses smite, and cast them out.

013:013 Nevertheless the children of Israel expelled not the
        Geshurites, nor the Maachathites: but the Geshurites and the
        Maachathites dwell among the Israelites until this day.

013:014 Only unto the tribes of Levi he gave none inheritance; the
        sacrifices of the LORD God of Israel made by fire are their
        inheritance, as he said unto them.

013:015 And Moses gave unto the tribe of the children of Reuben
        inheritance according to their families.

013:016 And their coast was from Aroer, that is on the bank of the
        river Arnon, and the city that is in the midst of the river,
        and all the plain by Medeba;

013:017 Heshbon, and all her cities that are in the plain; Dibon, and
        Bamothbaal, and Bethbaalmeon,

013:018 And Jahaza, and Kedemoth, and Mephaath,

013:019 And Kirjathaim, and Sibmah, and Zarethshahar in the mount of
        the valley,

013:020 And Bethpeor, and Ashdothpisgah, and Bethjeshimoth,

013:021 And all the cities of the plain, and all the kingdom of Sihon
        king of the Amorites, which reigned in Heshbon, whom Moses
        smote with the princes of Midian, Evi, and Rekem, and Zur, and
        Hur, and Reba, which were dukes of Sihon, dwelling in the
        country.

013:022 Balaam also the son of Beor, the soothsayer, did the children
        of Israel slay with the sword among them that were slain by
        them.

013:023 And the border of the children of Reuben was Jordan, and the
        border thereof. This was the inheritance of the children of
        Reuben after their families, the cities and the villages
        thereof.

013:024 And Moses gave inheritance unto the tribe of Gad, even unto
        the children of Gad according to their families.

013:025 And their coast was Jazer, and all the cities of Gilead, and
        half the land of the children of Ammon, unto Aroer that is
        before Rabbah;

013:026 And from Heshbon unto Ramathmizpeh, and Betonim; and from
        Mahanaim unto the border of Debir;

013:027 And in the valley, Betharam, and Bethnimrah, and Succoth, and
        Zaphon, the rest of the kingdom of Sihon king of Heshbon,
        Jordan and his border, even unto the edge of the sea of
        Chinnereth on the other side Jordan eastward.

013:028 This is the inheritance of the children of Gad after their
        families, the cities, and their villages.

013:029 And Moses gave inheritance unto the half tribe of Manasseh:
        and this was the possession of the half tribe of the children
        of Manasseh by their families.

013:030 And their coast was from Mahanaim, all Bashan, all the kingdom
        of Og king of Bashan, and all the towns of Jair, which are in
        Bashan, threescore cities:

013:031 And half Gilead, and Ashtaroth, and Edrei, cities of the
        kingdom of Og in Bashan, were pertaining unto the children of
        Machir the son of Manasseh, even to the one half of the
        children of Machir by their families.

013:032 These are the countries which Moses did distribute for
        inheritance in the plains of Moab, on the other side Jordan,
        by Jericho, eastward.

013:033 But unto the tribe of Levi Moses gave not any inheritance: the
        LORD God of Israel was their inheritance, as he said unto
        them.

014:001 And these are the countries which the children of Israel
        inherited in the land of Canaan, which Eleazar the priest, and
        Joshua the son of Nun, and the heads of the fathers of the
        tribes of the children of Israel, distributed for inheritance
        to them.

014:002 By lot was their inheritance, as the LORD commanded by the
        hand of Moses, for the nine tribes, and for the half tribe.

014:003 For Moses had given the inheritance of two tribes and an half
        tribe on the other side Jordan: but unto the Levites he gave
        none inheritance among them.

014:004 For the children of Joseph were two tribes, Manasseh and
        Ephraim: therefore they gave no part unto the Levites in the
        land, save cities to dwell in, with their suburbs for their
        cattle and for their substance.

014:005 As the LORD commanded Moses, so the children of Israel did,
        and they divided the land.

014:006 Then the children of Judah came unto Joshua in Gilgal: and
        Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenezite said unto him, Thou
        knowest the thing that the LORD said unto Moses the man of God
        concerning me and thee in Kadeshbarnea.

014:007 Forty years old was I when Moses the servant of the LORD sent
        me from Kadeshbarnea to espy out the land; and I brought him
        word again as it was in mine heart.

014:008 Nevertheless my brethren that went up with me made the heart
        of the people melt: but I wholly followed the LORD my God.

014:009 And Moses sware on that day, saying, Surely the land whereon
        thy feet have trodden shall be thine inheritance, and thy
        children's for ever, because thou hast wholly followed the
        LORD my God.

014:010 And now, behold, the LORD hath kept me alive, as he said,
        these forty and five years, even since the LORD spake this
        word unto Moses, while the children of Israel wandered in the
        wilderness: and now, lo, I am this day fourscore and five
        years old.

014:011 As yet I am as strong this day as I was in the day that Moses
        sent me: as my strength was then, even so is my strength now,
        for war, both to go out, and to come in.

014:012 Now therefore give me this mountain, whereof the LORD spake in
        that day; for thou heardest in that day how the Anakims were
        there, and that the cities were great and fenced: if so be the
        LORD will be with me, then I shall be able to drive them out,
        as the LORD said.

014:013 And Joshua blessed him, and gave unto Caleb the son of
        Jephunneh Hebron for an inheritance.

014:014 Hebron therefore became the inheritance of Caleb the son of
        Jephunneh the Kenezite unto this day, because that he wholly
        followed the LORD God of Israel.

014:015 And the name of Hebron before was Kirjatharba; which Arba was
        a great man among the Anakims. And the land had rest from war.

015:001 This then was the lot of the tribe of the children of Judah by
        their families; even to the border of Edom the wilderness of
        Zin southward was the uttermost part of the south coast.

015:002 And their south border was from the shore of the salt sea,
        from the bay that looketh southward:

015:003 And it went out to the south side to Maalehacrabbim, and
        passed along to Zin, and ascended up on the south side unto
        Kadeshbarnea, and passed along to Hezron, and went up to Adar,
        and fetched a compass to Karkaa:

015:004 From thence it passed toward Azmon, and went out unto the
        river of Egypt; and the goings out of that coast were at the
        sea: this shall be your south coast.

015:005 And the east border was the salt sea, even unto the end of
        Jordan. And their border in the north quarter was from the bay
        of the sea at the uttermost part of Jordan:

015:006 And the border went up to Bethhogla, and passed along by the
        north of Betharabah; and the border went up to the stone of
        Bohan the son of Reuben:

015:007 And the border went up toward Debir from the valley of Achor,
        and so northward, looking toward Gilgal, that is before the
        going up to Adummim, which is on the south side of the river:
        and the border passed toward the waters of Enshemesh, and the
        goings out thereof were at Enrogel:

015:008 And the border went up by the valley of the son of Hinnom unto
        the south side of the Jebusite; the same is Jerusalem: and the
        border went up to the top of the mountain that lieth before
        the valley of Hinnom westward, which is at the end of the
        valley of the giants northward:

015:009 And the border was drawn from the top of the hill unto the
        fountain of the water of Nephtoah, and went out to the cities
        of mount Ephron; and the border was drawn to Baalah, which is
        Kirjathjearim:

015:010 And the border compassed from Baalah westward unto mount Seir,
        and passed along unto the side of mount Jearim, which is
        Chesalon, on the north side, and went down to Bethshemesh, and
        passed on to Timnah:

015:011 And the border went out unto the side of Ekron northward: and
        the border was drawn to Shicron, and passed along to mount
        Baalah, and went out unto Jabneel; and the goings out of the
        border were at the sea.

015:012 And the west border was to the great sea, and the coast
        thereof. This is the coast of the children of Judah round
        about according to their families.

015:013 And unto Caleb the son of Jephunneh he gave a part among the
        children of Judah, according to the commandment of the LORD to
        Joshua, even the city of Arba the father of Anak, which city
        is Hebron.

015:014 And Caleb drove thence the three sons of Anak, Sheshai, and
        Ahiman, and Talmai, the children of Anak.

015:015 And he went up thence to the inhabitants of Debir: and the
        name of Debir before was Kirjathsepher.

015:016 And Caleb said, He that smiteth Kirjathsepher, and taketh it,
        to him will I give Achsah my daughter to wife.

015:017 And Othniel the son of Kenaz, the brother of Caleb, took it:
        and he gave him Achsah his daughter to wife.

015:018 And it came to pass, as she came unto him, that she moved him
        to ask of her father a field: and she lighted off her ass; and
        Caleb said unto her, What wouldest thou?

015:019 Who answered, Give me a blessing; for thou hast given me a
        south land; give me also springs of water. And he gave her the
        upper springs, and the nether springs.

015:020 This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Judah
        according to their families.

015:021 And the uttermost cities of the tribe of the children of Judah
        toward the coast of Edom southward were Kabzeel, and Eder, and
        Jagur,

015:022 And Kinah, and Dimonah, and Adadah,

015:023 And Kedesh, and Hazor, and Ithnan,

015:024 Ziph, and Telem, and Bealoth,

015:025 And Hazor, Hadattah, and Kerioth, and Hezron, which is Hazor,

015:026 Amam, and Shema, and Moladah,

015:027 And Hazargaddah, and Heshmon, and Bethpalet,

015:028 And Hazarshual, and Beersheba, and Bizjothjah,

015:029 Baalah, and Iim, and Azem,

015:030 And Eltolad, and Chesil, and Hormah,

015:031 And Ziklag, and Madmannah, and Sansannah,

015:032 And Lebaoth, and Shilhim, and Ain, and Rimmon: all the cities
        are twenty and nine, with their villages:

015:033 And in the valley, Eshtaol, and Zoreah, and Ashnah,

015:034 And Zanoah, and Engannim, Tappuah, and Enam,

015:035 Jarmuth, and Adullam, Socoh, and Azekah,

015:036 And Sharaim, and Adithaim, and Gederah, and Gederothaim;
        fourteen cities with their villages:

015:037 Zenan, and Hadashah, and Migdalgad,

015:038 And Dilean, and Mizpeh, and Joktheel,

015:039 Lachish, and Bozkath, and Eglon,

015:040 And Cabbon, and Lahmam, and Kithlish,

015:041 And Gederoth, Bethdagon, and Naamah, and Makkedah; sixteen
        cities with their villages:

015:042 Libnah, and Ether, and Ashan,

015:043 And Jiphtah, and Ashnah, and Nezib,

015:044 And Keilah, and Achzib, and Mareshah; nine cities with their
        villages:

015:045 Ekron, with her towns and her villages:

015:046 From Ekron even unto the sea, all that lay near Ashdod, with
        their villages:

015:047 Ashdod with her towns and her villages, Gaza with her towns
        and her villages, unto the river of Egypt, and the great sea,
        and the border thereof:

015:048 And in the mountains, Shamir, and Jattir, and Socoh,

015:049 And Dannah, and Kirjathsannah, which is Debir,

015:050 And Anab, and Eshtemoh, and Anim,

015:051 And Goshen, and Holon, and Giloh; eleven cities with their
        villages:

015:052 Arab, and Dumah, and Eshean,

015:053 And Janum, and Bethtappuah, and Aphekah,

015:054 And Humtah, and Kirjatharba, which is Hebron, and Zior; nine
        cities with their villages:

015:055 Maon, Carmel, and Ziph, and Juttah,

015:056 And Jezreel, and Jokdeam, and Zanoah,

015:057 Cain, Gibeah, and Timnah; ten cities with their villages:

015:058 Halhul, Bethzur, and Gedor,

015:059 And Maarath, and Bethanoth, and Eltekon; six cities with their
        villages:

015:060 Kirjathbaal, which is Kirjathjearim, and Rabbah; two cities
        with their villages:

015:061 In the wilderness, Betharabah, Middin, and Secacah,

015:062 And Nibshan, and the city of Salt, and Engedi; six cities with
        their villages.

015:063 As for the Jebusites the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the
        children of Judah could not drive them out; but the Jebusites
        dwell with the children of Judah at Jerusalem unto this day.

016:001 And the lot of the children of Joseph fell from Jordan by
        Jericho, unto the water of Jericho on the east, to the
        wilderness that goeth up from Jericho throughout mount Bethel,

016:002 And goeth out from Bethel to Luz, and passeth along unto the
        borders of Archi to Ataroth,

016:003 And goeth down westward to the coast of Japhleti, unto the
        coast of Bethhoron the nether, and to Gezer; and the goings
        out thereof are at the sea.

016:004 So the children of Joseph, Manasseh and Ephraim, took their
        inheritance.

016:005 And the border of the children of Ephraim according to their
        families was thus: even the border of their inheritance on the
        east side was Atarothaddar, unto Bethhoron the upper;

016:006 And the border went out toward the sea to Michmethah on the
        north side; and the border went about eastward unto
        Taanathshiloh, and passed by it on the east to Janohah;

016:007 And it went down from Janohah to Ataroth, and to Naarath, and
        came to Jericho, and went out at Jordan.

016:008 The border went out from Tappuah westward unto the river
        Kanah; and the goings out thereof were at the sea. This is the
        inheritance of the tribe of the children of Ephraim by their
        families.

016:009 And the separate cities for the children of Ephraim were among
        the inheritance of the children of Manasseh, all the cities
        with their villages.

016:010 And they drave not out the Canaanites that dwelt in Gezer: but
        the Canaanites dwell among the Ephraimites unto this day, and
        serve under tribute.

017:001 There was also a lot for the tribe of Manasseh; for he was the
        firstborn of Joseph; to wit, for Machir the firstborn of
        Manasseh, the father of Gilead: because he was a man of war,
        therefore he had Gilead and Bashan.

017:002 There was also a lot for the rest of the children of Manasseh
        by their families; for the children of Abiezer, and for the
        children of Helek, and for the children of Asriel, and for the
        children of Shechem, and for the children of Hepher, and for
        the children of Shemida: these were the male children of
        Manasseh the son of Joseph by their families.

017:003 But Zelophehad, the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son
        of Machir, the son of Manasseh, had no sons, but daughters:
        and these are the names of his daughters, Mahlah, and Noah,
        Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah.

017:004 And they came near before Eleazar the priest, and before
        Joshua the son of Nun, and before the princes, saying, The
        LORD commanded Moses to give us an inheritance among our
        brethren. Therefore according to the commandment of the LORD
        he gave them an inheritance among the brethren of their
        father.

017:005 And there fell ten portions to Manasseh, beside the land of
        Gilead and Bashan, which were on the other side Jordan;

017:006 Because the daughters of Manasseh had an inheritance among his
        sons: and the rest of Manasseh's sons had the land of Gilead.

017:007 And the coast of Manasseh was from Asher to Michmethah, that
        lieth before Shechem; and the border went along on the right
        hand unto the inhabitants of Entappuah.

017:008 Now Manasseh had the land of Tappuah: but Tappuah on the
        border of Manasseh belonged to the children of Ephraim;

017:009 And the coast descended unto the river Kanah, southward of the
        river: these cities of Ephraim are among the cities of
        Manasseh: the coast of Manasseh also was on the north side of
        the river, and the outgoings of it were at the sea:

017:010 Southward it was Ephraim's, and northward it was Manasseh's,
        and the sea is his border; and they met together in Asher on
        the north, and in Issachar on the east.

017:011 And Manasseh had in Issachar and in Asher Bethshean and her
        towns, and Ibleam and her towns, and the inhabitants of Dor
        and her towns, and the inhabitants of Endor and her towns, and
        the inhabitants of Taanach and her towns, and the inhabitants
        of Megiddo and her towns, even three countries.

017:012 Yet the children of Manasseh could not drive out the
        inhabitants of those cities; but the Canaanites would dwell in
        that land.

017:013 Yet it came to pass, when the children of Israel were waxen
        strong, that they put the Canaanites to tribute, but did not
        utterly drive them out.

017:014 And the children of Joseph spake unto Joshua, saying, Why hast
        thou given me but one lot and one portion to inherit, seeing I
        am a great people, forasmuch as the LORD hath blessed me
        hitherto?

017:015 And Joshua answered them, If thou be a great people, then get
        thee up to the wood country, and cut down for thyself there in
        the land of the Perizzites and of the giants, if mount Ephraim
        be too narrow for thee.

017:016 And the children of Joseph said, The hill is not enough for
        us: and all the Canaanites that dwell in the land of the
        valley have chariots of iron, both they who are of Bethshean
        and her towns, and they who are of the valley of Jezreel.

017:017 And Joshua spake unto the house of Joseph, even to Ephraim and
        to Manasseh, saying, Thou art a great people, and hast great
        power: thou shalt not have one lot only:

017:018 But the mountain shall be thine; for it is a wood, and thou
        shalt cut it down: and the outgoings of it shall be thine: for
        thou shalt drive out the Canaanites, though they have iron
        chariots, and though they be strong.

018:001 And the whole congregation of the children of Israel assembled
        together at Shiloh, and set up the tabernacle of the
        congregation there. And the land was subdued before them.

018:002 And there remained among the children of Israel seven tribes,
        which had not yet received their inheritance.

018:003 And Joshua said unto the children of Israel, How long are ye
        slack to go to possess the land, which the LORD God of your
        fathers hath given you?

018:004 Give out from among you three men for each tribe: and I will
        send them, and they shall rise, and go through the land, and
        describe it according to the inheritance of them; and they
        shall come again to me.

018:005 And they shall divide it into seven parts: Judah shall abide
        in their coast on the south, and the house of Joseph shall
        abide in their coasts on the north.

018:006 Ye shall therefore describe the land into seven parts, and
        bring the description hither to me, that I may cast lots for
        you here before the LORD our God.

018:007 But the Levites have no part among you; for the priesthood of
        the LORD is their inheritance: and Gad, and Reuben, and half
        the tribe of Manasseh, have received their inheritance beyond
        Jordan on the east, which Moses the servant of the LORD gave
        them.

018:008 And the men arose, and went away: and Joshua charged them that
        went to describe the land, saying, Go and walk through the
        land, and describe it, and come again to me, that I may here
        cast lots for you before the LORD in Shiloh.

018:009 And the men went and passed through the land, and described it
        by cities into seven parts in a book, and came again to Joshua
        to the host at Shiloh.

018:010 And Joshua cast lots for them in Shiloh before the LORD: and
        there Joshua divided the land unto the children of Israel
        according to their divisions.

018:011 And the lot of the tribe of the children of Benjamin came up
        according to their families: and the coast of their lot came
        forth between the children of Judah and the children of
        Joseph.

018:012 And their border on the north side was from Jordan; and the
        border went up to the side of Jericho on the north side, and
        went up through the mountains westward; and the goings out
        thereof were at the wilderness of Bethaven.

018:013 And the border went over from thence toward Luz, to the side
        of Luz, which is Bethel, southward; and the border descended
        to Atarothadar, near the hill that lieth on the south side of
        the nether Bethhoron.

018:014 And the border was drawn thence, and compassed the corner of
        the sea southward, from the hill that lieth before Bethhoron
        southward; and the goings out thereof were at Kirjathbaal,
        which is Kirjathjearim, a city of the children of Judah: this
        was the west quarter.

018:015 And the south quarter was from the end of Kirjathjearim, and
        the border went out on the west, and went out to the well of
        waters of Nephtoah:

018:016 And the border came down to the end of the mountain that lieth
        before the valley of the son of Hinnom, and which is in the
        valley of the giants on the north, and descended to the valley
        of Hinnom, to the side of Jebusi on the south, and descended
        to Enrogel,

018:017 And was drawn from the north, and went forth to Enshemesh, and
        went forth toward Geliloth, which is over against the going up
        of Adummim, and descended to the stone of Bohan the son of
        Reuben,

018:018 And passed along toward the side over against Arabah
        northward, and went down unto Arabah:

018:019 And the border passed along to the side of Bethhoglah
        northward: and the outgoings of the border were at the north
        bay of the salt sea at the south end of Jordan: this was the
        south coast.

018:020 And Jordan was the border of it on the east side. This was the
        inheritance of the children of Benjamin, by the coasts thereof
        round about, according to their families.

018:021 Now the cities of the tribe of the children of Benjamin
        according to their families were Jericho, and Bethhoglah, and
        the valley of Keziz,

018:022 And Betharabah, and Zemaraim, and Bethel,

018:023 And Avim, and Pharah, and Ophrah,

018:024 And Chepharhaammonai, and Ophni, and Gaba; twelve cities with
        their villages:

018:025 Gibeon, and Ramah, and Beeroth,

018:026 And Mizpeh, and Chephirah, and Mozah,

018:027 And Rekem, and Irpeel, and Taralah,

018:028 And Zelah, Eleph, and Jebusi, which is Jerusalem, Gibeath, and
        Kirjath; fourteen cities with their villages. This is the
        inheritance of the children of Benjamin according to their
        families.

019:001 And the second lot came forth to Simeon, even for the tribe of
        the children of Simeon according to their families: and their
        inheritance was within the inheritance of the children of
        Judah.

019:002 And they had in their inheritance Beersheba, and Sheba, and
        Moladah,

019:003 And Hazarshual, and Balah, and Azem,

019:004 And Eltolad, and Bethul, and Hormah,

019:005 And Ziklag, and Bethmarcaboth, and Hazarsusah,

019:006 And Bethlebaoth, and Sharuhen; thirteen cities and their
        villages:

019:007 Ain, Remmon, and Ether, and Ashan; four cities and their
        villages:

019:008 And all the villages that were round about these cities to
        Baalathbeer, Ramath of the south. This is the inheritance of
        the tribe of the children of Simeon according to their
        families.

019:009 Out of the portion of the children of Judah was the
        inheritance of the children of Simeon: for the part of the
        children of Judah was too much for them: therefore the
        children of Simeon had their inheritance within the
        inheritance of them.

019:010 And the third lot came up for the children of Zebulun
        according to their families: and the border of their
        inheritance was unto Sarid:

019:011 And their border went up toward the sea, and Maralah, and
        reached to Dabbasheth, and reached to the river that is before
        Jokneam;

019:012 And turned from Sarid eastward toward the sunrising unto the
        border of Chislothtabor, and then goeth out to Daberath, and
        goeth up to Japhia,

019:013 And from thence passeth on along on the east to Gittahhepher,
        to Ittahkazin, and goeth out to Remmonmethoar to Neah;

019:014 And the border compasseth it on the north side to Hannathon:
        and the outgoings thereof are in the valley of Jiphthahel:

019:015 And Kattath, and Nahallal, and Shimron, and Idalah, and
        Bethlehem: twelve cities with their villages.

019:016 This is the inheritance of the children of Zebulun according
        to their families, these cities with their villages.

019:017 And the fourth lot came out to Issachar, for the children of
        Issachar according to their families.

019:018 And their border was toward Jezreel, and Chesulloth, and
        Shunem,

019:019 And Haphraim, and Shihon, and Anaharath,

019:020 And Rabbith, and Kishion, and Abez,

019:021 And Remeth, and Engannim, and Enhaddah, and Bethpazzez;

019:022 And the coast reacheth to Tabor, and Shahazimah, and
        Bethshemesh; and the outgoings of their border were at Jordan:
        sixteen cities with their villages.

019:023 This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of
        Issachar according to their families, the cities and their
        villages.

019:024 And the fifth lot came out for the tribe of the children of
        Asher according to their families.

019:025 And their border was Helkath, and Hali, and Beten, and
        Achshaph,

019:026 And Alammelech, and Amad, and Misheal; and reacheth to Carmel
        westward, and to Shihorlibnath;

019:027 And turneth toward the sunrising to Bethdagon, and reacheth to
        Zebulun, and to the valley of Jiphthahel toward the north side
        of Bethemek, and Neiel, and goeth out to Cabul on the left
        hand,

019:028 And Hebron, and Rehob, and Hammon, and Kanah, even unto great
        Zidon;

019:029 And then the coast turneth to Ramah, and to the strong city
        Tyre; and the coast turneth to Hosah; and the outgoings
        thereof are at the sea from the coast to Achzib:

019:030 Ummah also, and Aphek, and Rehob: twenty and two cities with
        their villages.

019:031 This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Asher
        according to their families, these cities with their villages.

019:032 The sixth lot came out to the children of Naphtali, even for
        the children of Naphtali according to their families.

019:033 And their coast was from Heleph, from Allon to Zaanannim, and
        Adami, Nekeb, and Jabneel, unto Lakum; and the outgoings
        thereof were at Jordan:

019:034 And then the coast turneth westward to Aznothtabor, and goeth
        out from thence to Hukkok, and reacheth to Zebulun on the
        south side, and reacheth to Asher on the west side, and to
        Judah upon Jordan toward the sunrising.

019:035 And the fenced cities are Ziddim, Zer, and Hammath, Rakkath,
        and Chinnereth,

019:036 And Adamah, and Ramah, and Hazor,

019:037 And Kedesh, and Edrei, and Enhazor,

019:038 And Iron, and Migdalel, Horem, and Bethanath, and Bethshemesh;
        nineteen cities with their villages.

019:039 This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of
        Naphtali according to their families, the cities and their
        villages.

019:040 And the seventh lot came out for the tribe of the children of
        Dan according to their families.

019:041 And the coast of their inheritance was Zorah, and Eshtaol, and
        Irshemesh,

019:042 And Shaalabbin, and Ajalon, and Jethlah,

019:043 And Elon, and Thimnathah, and Ekron,

019:044 And Eltekeh, and Gibbethon, and Baalath,

019:045 And Jehud, and Beneberak, and Gathrimmon,

019:046 And Mejarkon, and Rakkon, with the border before Japho.

019:047 And the coast of the children of Dan went out too little for
        them: therefore the children of Dan went up to fight against
        Leshem, and took it, and smote it with the edge of the sword,
        and possessed it, and dwelt therein, and called Leshem, Dan,
        after the name of Dan their father.

019:048 This is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of Dan
        according to their families, these cities with their villages.

019:049 When they had made an end of dividing the land for inheritance
        by their coasts, the children of Israel gave an inheritance to
        Joshua the son of Nun among them:

019:050 According to the word of the LORD they gave him the city which
        he asked, even Timnathserah in mount Ephraim: and he built the
        city, and dwelt therein.

019:051 These are the inheritances, which Eleazar the priest, and
        Joshua the son of Nun, and the heads of the fathers of the
        tribes of the children of Israel, divided for an inheritance
        by lot in Shiloh before the LORD, at the door of the
        tabernacle of the congregation. So they made an end of
        dividing the country.

020:001 The LORD also spake unto Joshua, saying,

020:002 Speak to the children of Israel, saying, Appoint out for you
        cities of refuge, whereof I spake unto you by the hand of
        Moses:

020:003 That the slayer that killeth any person unawares and
        unwittingly may flee thither: and they shall be your refuge
        from the avenger of blood.

020:004 And when he that doth flee unto one of those cities shall
        stand at the entering of the gate of the city, and shall
        declare his cause in the ears of the elders of that city, they
        shall take him into the city unto them, and give him a place,
        that he may dwell among them.

020:005 And if the avenger of blood pursue after him, then they shall
        not deliver the slayer up into his hand; because he smote his
        neighbour unwittingly, and hated him not beforetime.

020:006 And he shall dwell in that city, until he stand before the
        congregation for judgment, and until the death of the high
        priest that shall be in those days: then shall the slayer
        return, and come unto his own city, and unto his own house,
        unto the city from whence he fled.

020:007 And they appointed Kedesh in Galilee in mount Naphtali, and
        Shechem in mount Ephraim, and Kirjatharba, which is Hebron, in
        the mountain of Judah.

020:008 And on the other side Jordan by Jericho eastward, they
        assigned Bezer in the wilderness upon the plain out of the
        tribe of Reuben, and Ramoth in Gilead out of the tribe of Gad,
        and Golan in Bashan out of the tribe of Manasseh.

020:009 These were the cities appointed for all the children of
        Israel, and for the stranger that sojourneth among them, that
        whosoever killeth any person at unawares might flee thither,
        and not die by the hand of the avenger of blood, until he
        stood before the congregation.

021:001 Then came near the heads of the fathers of the Levites unto
        Eleazar the priest, and unto Joshua the son of Nun, and unto
        the heads of the fathers of the tribes of the children of
        Israel;

021:002 And they spake unto them at Shiloh in the land of Canaan,
        saying, The LORD commanded by the hand of Moses to give us
        cities to dwell in, with the suburbs thereof for our cattle.

021:003 And the children of Israel gave unto the Levites out of their
        inheritance, at the commandment of the LORD, these cities and
        their suburbs.

021:004 And the lot came out for the families of the Kohathites: and
        the children of Aaron the priest, which were of the Levites,
        had by lot out of the tribe of Judah, and out of the tribe of
        Simeon, and out of the tribe of Benjamin, thirteen cities.

021:005 And the rest of the children of Kohath had by lot out of the
        families of the tribe of Ephraim, and out of the tribe of Dan,
        and out of the half tribe of Manasseh, ten cities.

021:006 And the children of Gershon had by lot out of the families of
        the tribe of Issachar, and out of the tribe of Asher, and out
        of the tribe of Naphtali, and out of the half tribe of
        Manasseh in Bashan, thirteen cities.

021:007 The children of Merari by their families had out of the tribe
        of Reuben, and out of the tribe of Gad, and out of the tribe
        of Zebulun, twelve cities.

021:008 And the children of Israel gave by lot unto the Levites these
        cities with their suburbs, as the LORD commanded by the hand
        of Moses.

021:009 And they gave out of the tribe of the children of Judah, and
        out of the tribe of the children of Simeon, these cities which
        are here mentioned by name.

021:010 Which the children of Aaron, being of the families of the
        Kohathites, who were of the children of Levi, had: for theirs
        was the first lot.

021:011 And they gave them the city of Arba the father of Anak, which
        city is Hebron, in the hill country of Judah, with the suburbs
        thereof round about it.

021:012 But the fields of the city, and the villages thereof, gave
        they to Caleb the son of Jephunneh for his possession.

021:013 Thus they gave to the children of Aaron the priest Hebron with
        her suburbs, to be a city of refuge for the slayer; and Libnah
        with her suburbs,

021:014 And Jattir with her suburbs, and Eshtemoa with her suburbs,

021:015 And Holon with her suburbs, and Debir with her suburbs,

021:016 And Ain with her suburbs, and Juttah with her suburbs, and
        Bethshemesh with her suburbs; nine cities out of those two
        tribes.

021:017 And out of the tribe of Benjamin, Gibeon with her suburbs,
        Geba with her suburbs,

021:018 Anathoth with her suburbs, and Almon with her suburbs; four
        cities.

021:019 All the cities of the children of Aaron, the priests, were
        thirteen cities with their suburbs.

021:020 And the families of the children of Kohath, the Levites which
        remained of the children of Kohath, even they had the cities
        of their lot out of the tribe of Ephraim.

021:021 For they gave them Shechem with her suburbs in mount Ephraim,
        to be a city of refuge for the slayer; and Gezer with her
        suburbs,

021:022 And Kibzaim with her suburbs, and Bethhoron with her suburbs;
        four cities.

021:023 And out of the tribe of Dan, Eltekeh with her suburbs,
        Gibbethon with her suburbs,

021:024 Aijalon with her suburbs, Gathrimmon with her suburbs; four
        cities.

021:025 And out of the half tribe of Manasseh, Tanach with her
        suburbs, and Gathrimmon with her suburbs; two cities.

021:026 All the cities were ten with their suburbs for the families of
        the children of Kohath that remained.

021:027 And unto the children of Gershon, of the families of the
        Levites, out of the other half tribe of Manasseh they gave
        Golan in Bashan with her suburbs, to be a city of refuge for
        the slayer; and Beeshterah with her suburbs; two cities.

021:028 And out of the tribe of Issachar, Kishon with her suburbs,
        Dabareh with her suburbs,

021:029 Jarmuth with her suburbs, Engannim with her suburbs; four
        cities.

021:030 And out of the tribe of Asher, Mishal with her suburbs, Abdon
        with her suburbs,

021:031 Helkath with her suburbs, and Rehob with her suburbs; four
        cities.

021:032 And out of the tribe of Naphtali, Kedesh in Galilee with her
        suburbs, to be a city of refuge for the slayer; and Hammothdor
        with her suburbs, and Kartan with her suburbs; three cities.

021:033 All the cities of the Gershonites according to their families
        were thirteen cities with their suburbs.

021:034 And unto the families of the children of Merari, the rest of
        the Levites, out of the tribe of Zebulun, Jokneam with her
        suburbs, and Kartah with her suburbs,

021:035 Dimnah with her suburbs, Nahalal with her suburbs; four
        cities.

021:036 And out of the tribe of Reuben, Bezer with her suburbs, and
        Jahazah with her suburbs,

021:037 Kedemoth with her suburbs, and Mephaath with her suburbs; four
        cities.

021:038 And out of the tribe of Gad, Ramoth in Gilead with her
        suburbs, to be a city of refuge for the slayer; and Mahanaim
        with her suburbs,

021:039 Heshbon with her suburbs, Jazer with her suburbs; four cities
        in all.

021:040 So all the cities for the children of Merari by their
        families, which were remaining of the families of the Levites,
        were by their lot twelve cities.

021:041 All the cities of the Levites within the possession of the
        children of Israel were forty and eight cities with their
        suburbs.

021:042 These cities were every one with their suburbs round about
        them: thus were all these cities.

021:043 And the LORD gave unto Israel all the land which he sware to
        give unto their fathers; and they possessed it, and dwelt
        therein.

021:044 And the LORD gave them rest round about, according to all that
        he sware unto their fathers: and there stood not a man of all
        their enemies before them; the LORD delivered all their
        enemies into their hand.

021:045 There failed not ought of any good thing which the LORD had
        spoken unto the house of Israel; all came to pass.

022:001 Then Joshua called the Reubenites, and the Gadites, and the
        half tribe of Manasseh,

022:002 And said unto them, Ye have kept all that Moses the servant of
        the LORD commanded you, and have obeyed my voice in all that I
        commanded you:

022:003 Ye have not left your brethren these many days unto this day,
        but have kept the charge of the commandment of the LORD your
        God.

022:004 And now the LORD your God hath given rest unto your brethren,
        as he promised them: therefore now return ye, and get you unto
        your tents, and unto the land of your possession, which Moses
        the servant of the LORD gave you on the other side Jordan.

022:005 But take diligent heed to do the commandment and the law,
        which Moses the servant of the LORD charged you, to love the
        LORD your God, and to walk in all his ways, and to keep his
        commandments, and to cleave unto him, and to serve him with
        all your heart and with all your soul.

022:006 So Joshua blessed them, and sent them away: and they went unto
        their tents.

022:007 Now to the one half of the tribe of Manasseh Moses had given
        possession in Bashan: but unto the other half thereof gave
        Joshua among their brethren on this side Jordan westward. And
        when Joshua sent them away also unto their tents, then he
        blessed them,

022:008 And he spake unto them, saying, Return with much riches unto
        your tents, and with very much cattle, with silver, and with
        gold, and with brass, and with iron, and with very much
        raiment: divide the spoil of your enemies with your brethren.

022:009 And the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the
        half tribe of Manasseh returned, and departed from the
        children of Israel out of Shiloh, which is in the land of
        Canaan, to go unto the country of Gilead, to the land of their
        possession, whereof they were possessed, according to the word
        of the LORD by the hand of Moses.

022:010 And when they came unto the borders of Jordan, that are in the
        land of Canaan, the children of Reuben and the children of Gad
        and the half tribe of Manasseh built there an altar by Jordan,
        a great altar to see to.

022:011 And the children of Israel heard say, Behold, the children of
        Reuben and the children of Gad and the half tribe of Manasseh
        have built an altar over against the land of Canaan, in the
        borders of Jordan, at the passage of the children of Israel.

022:012 And when the children of Israel heard of it, the whole
        congregation of the children of Israel gathered themselves
        together at Shiloh, to go up to war against them.

022:013 And the children of Israel sent unto the children of Reuben,
        and to the children of Gad, and to the half tribe of Manasseh,
        into the land of Gilead, Phinehas the son of Eleazar the
        priest,

022:014 And with him ten princes, of each chief house a prince
        throughout all the tribes of Israel; and each one was an head
        of the house of their fathers among the thousands of Israel.

022:015 And they came unto the children of Reuben, and to the children
        of Gad, and to the half tribe of Manasseh, unto the land of
        Gilead, and they spake with them, saying,

022:016 Thus saith the whole congregation of the LORD, What trespass
        is this that ye have committed against the God of Israel, to
        turn away this day from following the LORD, in that ye have
        builded you an altar, that ye might rebel this day against the
        LORD?

022:017 Is the iniquity of Peor too little for us, from which we are
        not cleansed until this day, although there was a plague in
        the congregation of the LORD,

022:018 But that ye must turn away this day from following the LORD?
        and it will be, seeing ye rebel to day against the LORD, that
        to morrow he will be wroth with the whole congregation of
        Israel.

022:019 Notwithstanding, if the land of your possession be unclean,
        then pass ye over unto the land of the possession of the LORD,
        wherein the LORD's tabernacle dwelleth, and take possession
        among us: but rebel not against the LORD, nor rebel against
        us, in building you an altar beside the altar of the LORD our
        God.

022:020 Did not Achan the son of Zerah commit a trespass in the
        accursed thing, and wrath fell on all the congregation of
        Israel? and that man perished not alone in his iniquity.

022:021 Then the children of Reuben and the children of Gad and the
        half tribe of Manasseh answered, and said unto the heads of
        the thousands of Israel,

022:022 The LORD God of gods, the LORD God of gods, he knoweth, and
        Israel he shall know; if it be in rebellion, or if in
        transgression against the LORD, (save us not this day,)

022:023 That we have built us an altar to turn from following the
        LORD, or if to offer thereon burnt offering or meat offering,
        or if to offer peace offerings thereon, let the LORD himself
        require it;

022:024 And if we have not rather done it for fear of this thing,
        saying, In time to come your children might speak unto our
        children, saying, What have ye to do with the LORD God of
        Israel?

022:025 For the LORD hath made Jordan a border between us and you, ye
        children of Reuben and children of Gad; ye have no part in the
        LORD: so shall your children make our children cease from
        fearing the LORD.

022:026 Therefore we said, Let us now prepare to build us an altar,
        not for burnt offering, nor for sacrifice:

022:027 But that it may be a witness between us, and you, and our
        generations after us, that we might do the service of the LORD
        before him with our burnt offerings, and with our sacrifices,
        and with our peace offerings; that your children may not say
        to our children in time to come, Ye have no part in the LORD.

022:028 Therefore said we, that it shall be, when they should so say
        to us or to our generations in time to come, that we may say
        again, Behold the pattern of the altar of the LORD, which our
        fathers made, not for burnt offerings, nor for sacrifices; but
        it is a witness between us and you.

022:029 God forbid that we should rebel against the LORD, and turn
        this day from following the LORD, to build an altar for burnt
        offerings, for meat offerings, or for sacrifices, beside the
        altar of the LORD our God that is before his tabernacle.

022:030 And when Phinehas the priest, and the princes of the
        congregation and heads of the thousands of Israel which were
        with him, heard the words that the children of Reuben and the
        children of Gad and the children of Manasseh spake, it pleased
        them.

022:031 And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest said unto the
        children of Reuben, and to the children of Gad, and to the
        children of Manasseh, This day we perceive that the LORD is
        among us, because ye have not committed this trespass against
        the LORD: now ye have delivered the children of Israel out of
        the hand of the LORD.

022:032 And Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, and the princes,
        returned from the children of Reuben, and from the children of
        Gad, out of the land of Gilead, unto the land of Canaan, to
        the children of Israel, and brought them word again.

022:033 And the thing pleased the children of Israel; and the children
        of Israel blessed God, and did not intend to go up against
        them in battle, to destroy the land wherein the children of
        Reuben and Gad dwelt.

022:034 And the children of Reuben and the children of Gad called the
        altar Ed: for it shall be a witness between us that the LORD
        is God.

023:001 And it came to pass a long time after that the LORD had given
        rest unto Israel from all their enemies round about, that
        Joshua waxed old and stricken in age.

023:002 And Joshua called for all Israel, and for their elders, and
        for their heads, and for their judges, and for their officers,
        and said unto them, I am old and stricken in age:

023:003 And ye have seen all that the LORD your God hath done unto all
        these nations because of you; for the LORD your God is he that
        hath fought for you.

023:004 Behold, I have divided unto you by lot these nations that
        remain, to be an inheritance for your tribes, from Jordan,
        with all the nations that I have cut off, even unto the great
        sea westward.

023:005 And the LORD your God, he shall expel them from before you,
        and drive them from out of your sight; and ye shall possess
        their land, as the LORD your God hath promised unto you.

023:006 Be ye therefore very courageous to keep and to do all that is
        written in the book of the law of Moses, that ye turn not
        aside therefrom to the right hand or to the left;

023:007 That ye come not among these nations, these that remain among
        you; neither make mention of the name of their gods, nor cause
        to swear by them, neither serve them, nor bow yourselves unto
        them:

023:008 But cleave unto the LORD your God, as ye have done unto this
        day.

023:009 For the LORD hath driven out from before you great nations and
        strong: but as for you, no man hath been able to stand before
        you unto this day.

023:010 One man of you shall chase a thousand: for the LORD your God,
        he it is that fighteth for you, as he hath promised you.

023:011 Take good heed therefore unto yourselves, that ye love the
        LORD your God.

023:012 Else if ye do in any wise go back, and cleave unto the remnant
        of these nations, even these that remain among you, and shall
        make marriages with them, and go in unto them, and they to
        you:

023:013 Know for a certainty that the LORD your God will no more drive
        out any of these nations from before you; but they shall be
        snares and traps unto you, and scourges in your sides, and
        thorns in your eyes, until ye perish from off this good land
        which the LORD your God hath given you.

023:014 And, behold, this day I am going the way of all the earth: and
        ye know in all your hearts and in all your souls, that not one
        thing hath failed of all the good things which the LORD your
        God spake concerning you; all are come to pass unto you, and
        not one thing hath failed thereof.

023:015 Therefore it shall come to pass, that as all good things are
        come upon you, which the LORD your God promised you; so shall
        the LORD bring upon you all evil things, until he have
        destroyed you from off this good land which the LORD your God
        hath given you.

023:016 When ye have transgressed the covenant of the LORD your God,
        which he commanded you, and have gone and served other gods,
        and bowed yourselves to them; then shall the anger of the LORD
        be kindled against you, and ye shall perish quickly from off
        the good land which he hath given unto you.

024:001 And Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel to Shechem, and
        called for the elders of Israel, and for their heads, and for
        their judges, and for their officers; and they presented
        themselves before God.

024:002 And Joshua said unto all the people, Thus saith the LORD God
        of Israel, Your fathers dwelt on the other side of the flood
        in old time, even Terah, the father of Abraham, and the father
        of Nachor: and they served other gods.

024:003 And I took your father Abraham from the other side of the
        flood, and led him throughout all the land of Canaan, and
        multiplied his seed, and gave him Isaac.

024:004 And I gave unto Isaac Jacob and Esau: and I gave unto Esau
        mount Seir, to possess it; but Jacob and his children went
        down into Egypt.

024:005 I sent Moses also and Aaron, and I plagued Egypt, according to
        that which I did among them: and afterward I brought you out.

024:006 And I brought your fathers out of Egypt: and ye came unto the
        sea; and the Egyptians pursued after your fathers with
        chariots and horsemen unto the Red sea.

024:007 And when they cried unto the LORD, he put darkness between you
        and the Egyptians, and brought the sea upon them, and covered
        them; and your eyes have seen what I have done in Egypt: and
        ye dwelt in the wilderness a long season.

024:008 And I brought you into the land of the Amorites, which dwelt
        on the other side Jordan; and they fought with you: and I gave
        them into your hand, that ye might possess their land; and I
        destroyed them from before you.

024:009 Then Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, arose and warred
        against Israel, and sent and called Balaam the son of Beor to
        curse you:

024:010 But I would not hearken unto Balaam; therefore he blessed you
        still: so I delivered you out of his hand.

024:011 And you went over Jordan, and came unto Jericho: and the men
        of Jericho fought against you, the Amorites, and the
        Perizzites, and the Canaanites, and the Hittites, and the
        Girgashites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites; and I delivered
        them into your hand.

024:012 And I sent the hornet before you, which drave them out from
        before you, even the two kings of the Amorites; but not with
        thy sword, nor with thy bow.

024:013 And I have given you a land for which ye did not labour, and
        cities which ye built not, and ye dwell in them; of the
        vineyards and oliveyards which ye planted not do ye eat.

024:014 Now therefore fear the LORD, and serve him in sincerity and in
        truth: and put away the gods which your fathers served on the
        other side of the flood, and in Egypt; and serve ye the LORD.

024:015 And if it seem evil unto you to serve the LORD, choose you
        this day whom ye will serve; whether the gods which your
        fathers served that were on the other side of the flood, or
        the gods of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell: but as for
        me and my house, we will serve the LORD.

024:016 And the people answered and said, God forbid that we should
        forsake the LORD, to serve other gods;

024:017 For the LORD our God, he it is that brought us up and our
        fathers out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage,
        and which did those great signs in our sight, and preserved us
        in all the way wherein we went, and among all the people
        through whom we passed:

024:018 And the LORD drave out from before us all the people, even the
        Amorites which dwelt in the land: therefore will we also serve
        the LORD; for he is our God.

024:019 And Joshua said unto the people, Ye cannot serve the LORD: for
        he is an holy God; he is a jealous God; he will not forgive
        your transgressions nor your sins.

024:020 If ye forsake the LORD, and serve strange gods, then he will
        turn and do you hurt, and consume you, after that he hath done
        you good.

024:021 And the people said unto Joshua, Nay; but we will serve the
        LORD.

024:022 And Joshua said unto the people, Ye are witnesses against
        yourselves that ye have chosen you the LORD, to serve him. And
        they said, We are witnesses.

024:023 Now therefore put away, said he, the strange gods which are
        among you, and incline your heart unto the LORD God of Israel.

024:024 And the people said unto Joshua, The LORD our God will we
        serve, and his voice will we obey.

024:025 So Joshua made a covenant with the people that day, and set
        them a statute and an ordinance in Shechem.

024:026 And Joshua wrote these words in the book of the law of God,
        and took a great stone, and set it up there under an oak, that
        was by the sanctuary of the LORD.

024:027 And Joshua said unto all the people, Behold, this stone shall
        be a witness unto us; for it hath heard all the words of the
        LORD which he spake unto us: it shall be therefore a witness
        unto you, lest ye deny your God.

024:028 So Joshua let the people depart, every man unto his
        inheritance.

024:029 And it came to pass after these things, that Joshua the son of
        Nun, the servant of the LORD, died, being an hundred and ten
        years old.

024:030 And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in
        Timnathserah, which is in mount Ephraim, on the north side of
        the hill of Gaash.

024:031 And Israel served the LORD all the days of Joshua, and all the
        days of the elders that overlived Joshua, and which had known
        all the works of the LORD, that he had done for Israel.

024:032 And the bones of Joseph, which the children of Israel brought
        up out of Egypt, buried they in Shechem, in a parcel of ground
        which Jacob bought of the sons of Hamor the father of Shechem
        for an hundred pieces of silver: and it became the inheritance
        of the children of Joseph.

024:033 And Eleazar the son of Aaron died; and they buried him in a
        hill that pertained to Phinehas his son, which was given him
        in mount Ephraim.

Book 07	Judges

001:001 Now after the death of Joshua it came to pass, that the
        children of Israel asked the LORD, saying, Who shall go up for
        us against the Canaanites first, to fight against them?

001:002 And the LORD said, Judah shall go up: behold, I have delivered
        the land into his hand.

001:003 And Judah said unto Simeon his brother, Come up with me into
        my lot, that we may fight against the Canaanites; and I
        likewise will go with thee into thy lot. So Simeon went with
        him.

001:004 And Judah went up; and the LORD delivered the Canaanites and
        the Perizzites into their hand: and they slew of them in Bezek
        ten thousand men.

001:005 And they found Adonibezek in Bezek: and they fought against
        him, and they slew the Canaanites and the Perizzites.

001:006 But Adonibezek fled; and they pursued after him, and caught
        him, and cut off his thumbs and his great toes.

001:007 And Adonibezek said, Threescore and ten kings, having their
        thumbs and their great toes cut off, gathered their meat under
        my table: as I have done, so God hath requited me. And they
        brought him to Jerusalem, and there he died.

001:008 Now the children of Judah had fought against Jerusalem, and
        had taken it, and smitten it with the edge of the sword, and
        set the city on fire.

001:009 And afterward the children of Judah went down to fight against
        the Canaanites, that dwelt in the mountain, and in the south,
        and in the valley.

001:010 And Judah went against the Canaanites that dwelt in Hebron:
        (now the name of Hebron before was Kirjatharba:) and they slew
        Sheshai, and Ahiman, and Talmai.

001:011 And from thence he went against the inhabitants of Debir: and
        the name of Debir before was Kirjathsepher:

001:012 And Caleb said, He that smiteth Kirjathsepher, and taketh it,
        to him will I give Achsah my daughter to wife.

001:013 And Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother, took
        it: and he gave him Achsah his daughter to wife.

001:014 And it came to pass, when she came to him, that she moved him
        to ask of her father a field: and she lighted from off her
        ass; and Caleb said unto her, What wilt thou?

001:015 And she said unto him, Give me a blessing: for thou hast given
        me a south land; give me also springs of water. And Caleb gave
        her the upper springs and the nether springs.

001:016 And the children of the Kenite, Moses' father in law, went up
        out of the city of palm trees with the children of Judah into
        the wilderness of Judah, which lieth in the south of Arad; and
        they went and dwelt among the people.

001:017 And Judah went with Simeon his brother, and they slew the
        Canaanites that inhabited Zephath, and utterly destroyed it.
        And the name of the city was called Hormah.

001:018 Also Judah took Gaza with the coast thereof, and Askelon with
        the coast thereof, and Ekron with the coast thereof.

001:019 And the LORD was with Judah; and he drave out the inhabitants
        of the mountain; but could not drive out the inhabitants of
        the valley, because they had chariots of iron.

001:020 And they gave Hebron unto Caleb, as Moses said: and he
        expelled thence the three sons of Anak.

001:021 And the children of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites
        that inhabited Jerusalem; but the Jebusites dwell with the
        children of Benjamin in Jerusalem unto this day.

001:022 And the house of Joseph, they also went up against Bethel: and
        the LORD was with them.

001:023 And the house of Joseph sent to descry Bethel. (Now the name
        of the city before was Luz.)

001:024 And the spies saw a man come forth out of the city, and they
        said unto him, Shew us, we pray thee, the entrance into the
        city, and we will shew thee mercy.

001:025 And when he shewed them the entrance into the city, they smote
        the city with the edge of the sword; but they let go the man
        and all his family.

001:026 And the man went into the land of the Hittites, and built a
        city, and called the name thereof Luz: which is the name
        thereof unto this day.

001:027 Neither did Manasseh drive out the inhabitants of Bethshean
        and her towns, nor Taanach and her towns, nor the inhabitants
        of Dor and her towns, nor the inhabitants of Ibleam and her
        towns, nor the inhabitants of Megiddo and her towns: but the
        Canaanites would dwell in that land.

001:028 And it came to pass, when Israel was strong, that they put the
        Canaanites to tribute, and did not utterly drive them out.

001:029 Neither did Ephraim drive out the Canaanites that dwelt in
        Gezer; but the Canaanites dwelt in Gezer among them.

001:030 Neither did Zebulun drive out the inhabitants of Kitron, nor
        the inhabitants of Nahalol; but the Canaanites dwelt among
        them, and became tributaries.

001:031 Neither did Asher drive out the inhabitants of Accho, nor the
        inhabitants of Zidon, nor of Ahlab, nor of Achzib, nor of
        Helbah, nor of Aphik, nor of Rehob:

001:032 But the Asherites dwelt among the Canaanites, the inhabitants
        of the land: for they did not drive them out.

001:033 Neither did Naphtali drive out the inhabitants of Bethshemesh,
        nor the inhabitants of Bethanath; but he dwelt among the
        Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land: nevertheless the
        inhabitants of Bethshemesh and of Bethanath became tributaries
        unto them.

001:034 And the Amorites forced the children of Dan into the mountain:
        for they would not suffer them to come down to the valley:

001:035 But the Amorites would dwell in mount Heres in Aijalon, and in
        Shaalbim: yet the hand of the house of Joseph prevailed, so
        that they became tributaries.

001:036 And the coast of the Amorites was from the going up to
        Akrabbim, from the rock, and upward.

002:001 And an angel of the LORD came up from Gilgal to Bochim, and
        said, I made you to go up out of Egypt, and have brought you
        unto the land which I sware unto your fathers; and I said, I
        will never break my covenant with you.

002:002 And ye shall make no league with the inhabitants of this land;
        ye shall throw down their altars: but ye have not obeyed my
        voice: why have ye done this?

002:003 Wherefore I also said, I will not drive them out from before
        you; but they shall be as thorns in your sides, and their gods
        shall be a snare unto you.

002:004 And it came to pass, when the angel of the LORD spake these
        words unto all the children of Israel, that the people lifted
        up their voice, and wept.

002:005 And they called the name of that place Bochim: and they
        sacrificed there unto the LORD.

002:006 And when Joshua had let the people go, the children of Israel
        went every man unto his inheritance to possess the land.

002:007 And the people served the LORD all the days of Joshua, and all
        the days of the elders that outlived Joshua, who had seen all
        the great works of the LORD, that he did for Israel.

002:008 And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the LORD, died,
        being an hundred and ten years old.

002:009 And they buried him in the border of his inheritance in
        Timnathheres, in the mount of Ephraim, on the north side of
        the hill Gaash.

002:010 And also all that generation were gathered unto their fathers:
        and there arose another generation after them, which knew not
        the LORD, nor yet the works which he had done for Israel.

002:011 And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD,
        and served Baalim:

002:012 And they forsook the LORD God of their fathers, which brought
        them out of the land of Egypt, and followed other gods, of the
        gods of the people that were round about them, and bowed
        themselves unto them, and provoked the LORD to anger.

002:013 And they forsook the LORD, and served Baal and Ashtaroth.

002:014 And the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel, and he
        delivered them into the hands of spoilers that spoiled them,
        and he sold them into the hands of their enemies round about,
        so that they could not any longer stand before their enemies.

002:015 Whithersoever they went out, the hand of the LORD was against
        them for evil, as the LORD had said, and as the LORD had sworn
        unto them: and they were greatly distressed.

002:016 Nevertheless the LORD raised up judges, which delivered them
        out of the hand of those that spoiled them.

002:017 And yet they would not hearken unto their judges, but they
        went a whoring after other gods, and bowed themselves unto
        them: they turned quickly out of the way which their fathers
        walked in, obeying the commandments of the LORD; but they did
        not so.

002:018 And when the LORD raised them up judges, then the LORD was
        with the judge, and delivered them out of the hand of their
        enemies all the days of the judge: for it repented the LORD
        because of their groanings by reason of them that oppressed
        them and vexed them.

002:019 And it came to pass, when the judge was dead, that they
        returned, and corrupted themselves more than their fathers, in
        following other gods to serve them, and to bow down unto them;
        they ceased not from their own doings, nor from their stubborn
        way.

002:020 And the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel; and he said,
        Because that this people hath transgressed my covenant which I
        commanded their fathers, and have not hearkened unto my voice;

002:021 I also will not henceforth drive out any from before them of
        the nations which Joshua left when he died:

002:022 That through them I may prove Israel, whether they will keep
        the way of the LORD to walk therein, as their fathers did keep
        it, or not.

002:023 Therefore the LORD left those nations, without driving them
        out hastily; neither delivered he them into the hand of
        Joshua.

003:001 Now these are the nations which the LORD left, to prove Israel
        by them, even as many of Israel as had not known all the wars
        of Canaan;

003:002 Only that the generations of the children of Israel might
        know, to teach them war, at the least such as before knew
        nothing thereof;

003:003 Namely, five lords of the Philistines, and all the Canaanites,
        and the Sidonians, and the Hivites that dwelt in mount
        Lebanon, from mount Baalhermon unto the entering in of Hamath.

003:004 And they were to prove Israel by them, to know whether they
        would hearken unto the commandments of the LORD, which he
        commanded their fathers by the hand of Moses.

003:005 And the children of Israel dwelt among the Canaanites,
        Hittites, and Amorites, and Perizzites, and Hivites, and
        Jebusites:

003:006 And they took their daughters to be their wives, and gave
        their daughters to their sons, and served their gods.

003:007 And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD,
        and forgat the LORD their God, and served Baalim and the
        groves.

003:008 Therefore the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel, and he
        sold them into the hand of Chushanrishathaim king of
        Mesopotamia: and the children of Israel served
        Chushanrishathaim eight years.

003:009 And when the children of Israel cried unto the LORD, the LORD
        raised up a deliverer to the children of Israel, who delivered
        them, even Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb's younger brother.

003:010 And the Spirit of the LORD came upon him, and he judged
        Israel, and went out to war: and the LORD delivered
        Chushanrishathaim king of Mesopotamia into his hand; and his
        hand prevailed against Chushanrishathaim.

003:011 And the land had rest forty years. And Othniel the son of
        Kenaz died.

003:012 And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the
        LORD: and the LORD strengthened Eglon the king of Moab against
        Israel, because they had done evil in the sight of the LORD.

003:013 And he gathered unto him the children of Ammon and Amalek, and
        went and smote Israel, and possessed the city of palm trees.

003:014 So the children of Israel served Eglon the king of Moab
        eighteen years.

003:015 But when the children of Israel cried unto the LORD, the LORD
        raised them up a deliverer, Ehud the son of Gera, a Benjamite,
        a man lefthanded: and by him the children of Israel sent a
        present unto Eglon the king of Moab.

003:016 But Ehud made him a dagger which had two edges, of a cubit
        length; and he did gird it under his raiment upon his right
        thigh.

003:017 And he brought the present unto Eglon king of Moab: and Eglon
        was a very fat man.

003:018 And when he had made an end to offer the present, he sent away
        the people that bare the present.

003:019 But he himself turned again from the quarries that were by
        Gilgal, and said, I have a secret errand unto thee, O king:
        who said, Keep silence. And all that stood by him went out
        from him.

003:020 And Ehud came unto him; and he was sitting in a summer
        parlour, which he had for himself alone. And Ehud said, I have
        a message from God unto thee. And he arose out of his seat.

003:021 And Ehud put forth his left hand, and took the dagger from his
        right thigh, and thrust it into his belly:

003:022 And the haft also went in after the blade; and the fat closed
        upon the blade, so that he could not draw the dagger out of
        his belly; and the dirt came out.

003:023 Then Ehud went forth through the porch, and shut the doors of
        the parlour upon him, and locked them.

003:024 When he was gone out, his servants came; and when they saw
        that, behold, the doors of the parlour were locked, they said,
        Surely he covereth his feet in his summer chamber.

003:025 And they tarried till they were ashamed: and, behold, he
        opened not the doors of the parlour; therefore they took a
        key, and opened them: and, behold, their lord was fallen down
        dead on the earth.

003:026 And Ehud escaped while they tarried, and passed beyond the
        quarries, and escaped unto Seirath.

003:027 And it came to pass, when he was come, that he blew a trumpet
        in the mountain of Ephraim, and the children of Israel went
        down with him from the mount, and he before them.

003:028 And he said unto them, Follow after me: for the LORD hath
        delivered your enemies the Moabites into your hand. And they
        went down after him, and took the fords of Jordan toward Moab,
        and suffered not a man to pass over.

003:029 And they slew of Moab at that time about ten thousand men, all
        lusty, and all men of valour; and there escaped not a man.

003:030 So Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel. And the
        land had rest fourscore years.

003:031 And after him was Shamgar the son of Anath, which slew of the
        Philistines six hundred men with an ox goad: and he also
        delivered Israel.

004:001 And the children of Israel again did evil in the sight of the
        LORD, when Ehud was dead.

004:002 And the LORD sold them into the hand of Jabin king of Canaan,
        that reigned in Hazor; the captain of whose host was Sisera,
        which dwelt in Harosheth of the Gentiles.

004:003 And the children of Israel cried unto the LORD: for he had
        nine hundred chariots of iron; and twenty years he mightily
        oppressed the children of Israel.

004:004 And Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lapidoth, she judged
        Israel at that time.

004:005 And she dwelt under the palm tree of Deborah between Ramah and
        Bethel in mount Ephraim: and the children of Israel came up to
        her for judgment.

004:006 And she sent and called Barak the son of Abinoam out of
        Kedeshnaphtali, and said unto him, Hath not the LORD God of
        Israel commanded, saying, Go and draw toward mount Tabor, and
        take with thee ten thousand men of the children of Naphtali
        and of the children of Zebulun?

004:007 And I will draw unto thee to the river Kishon Sisera, the
        captain of Jabin's army, with his chariots and his multitude;
        and I will deliver him into thine hand.

004:008 And Barak said unto her, If thou wilt go with me, then I will
        go: but if thou wilt not go with me, then I will not go.

004:009 And she said, I will surely go with thee: notwithstanding the
        journey that thou takest shall not be for thine honour; for
        the LORD shall sell Sisera into the hand of a woman. And
        Deborah arose, and went with Barak to Kedesh.

004:010 And Barak called Zebulun and Naphtali to Kedesh; and he went
        up with ten thousand men at his feet: and Deborah went up with
        him.

004:011 Now Heber the Kenite, which was of the children of Hobab the
        father in law of Moses, had severed himself from the Kenites,
        and pitched his tent unto the plain of Zaanaim, which is by
        Kedesh.

004:012 And they shewed Sisera that Barak the son of Abinoam was gone
        up to mount Tabor.

004:013 And Sisera gathered together all his chariots, even nine
        hundred chariots of iron, and all the people that were with
        him, from Harosheth of the Gentiles unto the river of Kishon.

004:014 And Deborah said unto Barak, Up; for this is the day in which
        the LORD hath delivered Sisera into thine hand: is not the
        LORD gone out before thee? So Barak went down from mount
        Tabor, and ten thousand men after him.

004:015 And the LORD discomfited Sisera, and all his chariots, and all
        his host, with the edge of the sword before Barak; so that
        Sisera lighted down off his chariot, and fled away on his
        feet.

004:016 But Barak pursued after the chariots, and after the host, unto
        Harosheth of the Gentiles: and all the host of Sisera fell
        upon the edge of the sword; and there was not a man left.

004:017 Howbeit Sisera fled away on his feet to the tent of Jael the
        wife of Heber the Kenite: for there was peace between Jabin
        the king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite.

004:018 And Jael went out to meet Sisera, and said unto him, Turn in,
        my lord, turn in to me; fear not. And when he had turned in
        unto her into the tent, she covered him with a mantle.

004:019 And he said unto her, Give me, I pray thee, a little water to
        drink; for I am thirsty. And she opened a bottle of milk, and
        gave him drink, and covered him.

004:020 Again he said unto her, Stand in the door of the tent, and it
        shall be, when any man doth come and enquire of thee, and say,
        Is there any man here? that thou shalt say, No.

004:021 Then Jael Heber's wife took a nail of the tent, and took an
        hammer in her hand, and went softly unto him, and smote the
        nail into his temples, and fastened it into the ground: for he
        was fast asleep and weary. So he died.

004:022 And, behold, as Barak pursued Sisera, Jael came out to meet
        him, and said unto him, Come, and I will shew thee the man
        whom thou seekest. And when he came into her tent, behold,
        Sisera lay dead, and the nail was in his temples.

004:023 So God subdued on that day Jabin the king of Canaan before the
        children of Israel.

004:024 And the hand of the children of Israel prospered, and
        prevailed against Jabin the king of Canaan, until they had
        destroyed Jabin king of Canaan.

005:001 Then sang Deborah and Barak the son of Abinoam on that day,
        saying,

005:002 Praise ye the LORD for the avenging of Israel, when the people
        willingly offered themselves.

005:003 Hear, O ye kings; give ear, O ye princes; I, even I, will sing
        unto the LORD; I will sing praise to the LORD God of Israel.

005:004 LORD, when thou wentest out of Seir, when thou marchedst out
        of the field of Edom, the earth trembled, and the heavens
        dropped, the clouds also dropped water.

005:005 The mountains melted from before the LORD, even that Sinai
        from before the LORD God of Israel.

005:006 In the days of Shamgar the son of Anath, in the days of Jael,
        the highways were unoccupied, and the travellers walked
        through byways.

005:007 The inhabitants of the villages ceased, they ceased in Israel,
        until that I Deborah arose, that I arose a mother in Israel.

005:008 They chose new gods; then was war in the gates: was there a
        shield or spear seen among forty thousand in Israel?

005:009 My heart is toward the governors of Israel, that offered
        themselves willingly among the people. Bless ye the LORD.

005:010 Speak, ye that ride on white asses, ye that sit in judgment,
        and walk by the way.

005:011 They that are delivered from the noise of archers in the
        places of drawing water, there shall they rehearse the
        righteous acts of the LORD, even the righteous acts toward the
        inhabitants of his villages in Israel: then shall the people
        of the LORD go down to the gates.

005:012 Awake, awake, Deborah: awake, awake, utter a song: arise,
        Barak, and lead thy captivity captive, thou son of Abinoam.

005:013 Then he made him that remaineth have dominion over the nobles
        among the people: the LORD made me have dominion over the
        mighty.

005:014 Out of Ephraim was there a root of them against Amalek; after
        thee, Benjamin, among thy people; out of Machir came down
        governors, and out of Zebulun they that handle the pen of the
        writer.

005:015 And the princes of Issachar were with Deborah; even Issachar,
        and also Barak: he was sent on foot into the valley. For the
        divisions of Reuben there were great thoughts of heart.

005:016 Why abodest thou among the sheepfolds, to hear the bleatings
        of the flocks? For the divisions of Reuben there were great
        searchings of heart.

005:017 Gilead abode beyond Jordan: and why did Dan remain in ships?
        Asher continued on the sea shore, and abode in his breaches.

005:018 Zebulun and Naphtali were a people that jeoparded their lives
        unto the death in the high places of the field.

005:019 The kings came and fought, then fought the kings of Canaan in
        Taanach by the waters of Megiddo; they took no gain of money.

005:020 They fought from heaven; the stars in their courses fought
        against Sisera.

005:021 The river of Kishon swept them away, that ancient river, the
        river Kishon. O my soul, thou hast trodden down strength.

005:022 Then were the horsehoofs broken by the means of the pransings,
        the pransings of their mighty ones.

005:023 Curse ye Meroz, said the angel of the LORD, curse ye bitterly
        the inhabitants thereof; because they came not to the help of
        the LORD, to the help of the LORD against the mighty.

005:024 Blessed above women shall Jael the wife of Heber the Kenite
        be, blessed shall she be above women in the tent.

005:025 He asked water, and she gave him milk; she brought forth
        butter in a lordly dish.

005:026 She put her hand to the nail, and her right hand to the
        workmen's hammer; and with the hammer she smote Sisera, she
        smote off his head, when she had pierced and stricken through
        his temples.

005:027 At her feet he bowed, he fell, he lay down: at her feet he
        bowed, he fell: where he bowed, there he fell down dead.

005:028 The mother of Sisera looked out at a window, and cried through
        the lattice, Why is his chariot so long in coming? why tarry
        the wheels of his chariots?

005:029 Her wise ladies answered her, yea, she returned answer to
        herself,

005:030 Have they not sped? have they not divided the prey; to every
        man a damsel or two; to Sisera a prey of divers colours, a
        prey of divers colours of needlework, of divers colours of
        needlework on both sides, meet for the necks of them that take
        the spoil?

005:031 So let all thine enemies perish, O LORD: but let them that
        love him be as the sun when he goeth forth in his might. And
        the land had rest forty years.

006:001 And the children of Israel did evil in the sight of the LORD:
        and the LORD delivered them into the hand of Midian seven
        years.

006:002 And the hand of Midian prevailed against Israel: and because
        of the Midianites the children of Israel made them the dens
        which are in the mountains, and caves, and strong holds.

006:003 And so it was, when Israel had sown, that the Midianites came
        up, and the Amalekites, and the children of the east, even
        they came up against them;

006:004 And they encamped against them, and destroyed the increase of
        the earth, till thou come unto Gaza, and left no sustenance
        for Israel, neither sheep, nor ox, nor ass.

006:005 For they came up with their cattle and their tents, and they
        came as grasshoppers for multitude; for both they and their
        camels were without number: and they entered into the land to
        destroy it.

006:006 And Israel was greatly impoverished because of the Midianites;
        and the children of Israel cried unto the LORD.

006:007 And it came to pass, when the children of Israel cried unto
        the LORD because of the Midianites,

006:008 That the LORD sent a prophet unto the children of Israel,
        which said unto them, Thus saith the LORD God of Israel, I
        brought you up from Egypt, and brought you forth out of the
        house of bondage;

006:009 And I delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out
        of the hand of all that oppressed you, and drave them out from
        before you, and gave you their land;

006:010 And I said unto you, I am the LORD your God; fear not the gods
        of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell: but ye have not
        obeyed my voice.

006:011 And there came an angel of the LORD, and sat under an oak
        which was in Ophrah, that pertained unto Joash the Abiezrite:
        and his son Gideon threshed wheat by the winepress, to hide it
        from the Midianites.

006:012 And the angel of the LORD appeared unto him, and said unto
        him, The LORD is with thee, thou mighty man of valour.

006:013 And Gideon said unto him, Oh my Lord, if the LORD be with us,
        why then is all this befallen us? and where be all his
        miracles which our fathers told us of, saying, Did not the
        LORD bring us up from Egypt? but now the LORD hath forsaken
        us, and delivered us into the hands of the Midianites.

006:014 And the LORD looked upon him, and said, Go in this thy might,
        and thou shalt save Israel from the hand of the Midianites:
        have not I sent thee?

006:015 And he said unto him, Oh my Lord, wherewith shall I save
        Israel? behold, my family is poor in Manasseh, and I am the
        least in my father's house.

006:016 And the LORD said unto him, Surely I will be with thee, and
        thou shalt smite the Midianites as one man.

006:017 And he said unto him, If now I have found grace in thy sight,
        then shew me a sign that thou talkest with me.

006:018 Depart not hence, I pray thee, until I come unto thee, and
        bring forth my present, and set it before thee. And he said, I
        will tarry until thou come again.

006:019 And Gideon went in, and made ready a kid, and unleavened cakes
        of an ephah of flour: the flesh he put in a basket, and he put
        the broth in a pot, and brought it out unto him under the oak,
        and presented it.

006:020 And the angel of God said unto him, Take the flesh and the
        unleavened cakes, and lay them upon this rock, and pour out
        the broth. And he did so.

006:021 Then the angel of the LORD put forth the end of the staff that
        was in his hand, and touched the flesh and the unleavened
        cakes; and there rose up fire out of the rock, and consumed
        the flesh and the unleavened cakes. Then the angel of the LORD
        departed out of his sight.

006:022 And when Gideon perceived that he was an angel of the LORD,
        Gideon said, Alas, O LORD God! for because I have seen an
        angel of the LORD face to face.

006:023 And the LORD said unto him, Peace be unto thee; fear not: thou
        shalt not die.

006:024 Then Gideon built an altar there unto the LORD, and called it
        Jehovahshalom: unto this day it is yet in Ophrah of the
        Abiezrites.

006:025 And it came to pass the same night, that the LORD said unto
        him, Take thy father's young bullock, even the second bullock
        of seven years old, and throw down the altar of Baal that thy
        father hath, and cut down the grove that is by it:

006:026 And build an altar unto the LORD thy God upon the top of this
        rock, in the ordered place, and take the second bullock, and
        offer a burnt sacrifice with the wood of the grove which thou
        shalt cut down.

006:027 Then Gideon took ten men of his servants, and did as the LORD
        had said unto him: and so it was, because he feared his
        father's household, and the men of the city, that he could not
        do it by day, that he did it by night.

006:028 And when the men of the city arose early in the morning,
        behold, the altar of Baal was cast down, and the grove was cut
        down that was by it, and the second bullock was offered upon
        the altar that was built.

006:029 And they said one to another, Who hath done this thing? And
        when they enquired and asked, they said, Gideon the son of
        Joash hath done this thing.

006:030 Then the men of the city said unto Joash, Bring out thy son,
        that he may die: because he hath cast down the altar of Baal,
        and because he hath cut down the grove that was by it.

006:031 And Joash said unto all that stood against him, Will ye plead
        for Baal? will ye save him? he that will plead for him, let
        him be put to death whilst it is yet morning: if he be a god,
        let him plead for himself, because one hath cast down his
        altar.

006:032 Therefore on that day he called him Jerubbaal, saying, Let
        Baal plead against him, because he hath thrown down his altar.

006:033 Then all the Midianites and the Amalekites and the children of
        the east were gathered together, and went over, and pitched in
        the valley of Jezreel.

006:034 But the Spirit of the LORD came upon Gideon, and he blew a
        trumpet; and Abiezer was gathered after him.

006:035 And he sent messengers throughout all Manasseh; who also was
        gathered after him: and he sent messengers unto Asher, and
        unto Zebulun, and unto Naphtali; and they came up to meet
        them.

006:036 And Gideon said unto God, If thou wilt save Israel by mine
        hand, as thou hast said,

006:037 Behold, I will put a fleece of wool in the floor; and if the
        dew be on the fleece only, and it be dry upon all the earth
        beside, then shall I know that thou wilt save Israel by mine
        hand, as thou hast said.

006:038 And it was so: for he rose up early on the morrow, and thrust
        the fleece together, and wringed the dew out of the fleece, a
        bowl full of water.

006:039 And Gideon said unto God, Let not thine anger be hot against
        me, and I will speak but this once: let me prove, I pray thee,
        but this once with the fleece; let it now be dry only upon the
        fleece, and upon all the ground let there be dew.

006:040 And God did so that night: for it was dry upon the fleece
        only, and there was dew on all the ground.

007:001 Then Jerubbaal, who is Gideon, and all the people that were
        with him, rose up early, and pitched beside the well of Harod:
        so that the host of the Midianites were on the north side of
        them, by the hill of Moreh, in the valley.

007:002 And the LORD said unto Gideon, The people that are with thee
        are too many for me to give the Midianites into their hands,
        lest Israel vaunt themselves against me, saying, Mine own hand
        hath saved me.

007:003 Now therefore go to, proclaim in the ears of the people,
        saying, Whosoever is fearful and afraid, let him return and
        depart early from mount Gilead. And there returned of the
        people twenty and two thousand; and there remained ten
        thousand.

007:004 And the LORD said unto Gideon, The people are yet too many;
        bring them down unto the water, and I will try them for thee
        there: and it shall be, that of whom I say unto thee, This
        shall go with thee, the same shall go with thee; and of
        whomsoever I say unto thee, This shall not go with thee, the
        same shall not go.

007:005 So he brought down the people unto the water: and the LORD
        said unto Gideon, Every one that lappeth of the water with his
        tongue, as a dog lappeth, him shalt thou set by himself;
        likewise every one that boweth down upon his knees to drink.

007:006 And the number of them that lapped, putting their hand to
        their mouth, were three hundred men: but all the rest of the
        people bowed down upon their knees to drink water.

007:007 And the LORD said unto Gideon, By the three hundred men that
        lapped will I save you, and deliver the Midianites into thine
        hand: and let all the other people go every man unto his
        place.

007:008 So the people took victuals in their hand, and their trumpets:
        and he sent all the rest of Israel every man unto his tent,
        and retained those three hundred men: and the host of Midian
        was beneath him in the valley.

007:009 And it came to pass the same night, that the LORD said unto
        him, Arise, get thee down unto the host; for I have delivered
        it into thine hand.

007:010 But if thou fear to go down, go thou with Phurah thy servant
        down to the host:

007:011 And thou shalt hear what they say; and afterward shall thine
        hands be strengthened to go down unto the host. Then went he
        down with Phurah his servant unto the outside of the armed men
        that were in the host.

007:012 And the Midianites and the Amalekites and all the children of
        the east lay along in the valley like grasshoppers for
        multitude; and their camels were without number, as the sand
        by the sea side for multitude.

007:013 And when Gideon was come, behold, there was a man that told a
        dream unto his fellow, and said, Behold, I dreamed a dream,
        and, lo, a cake of barley bread tumbled into the host of
        Midian, and came unto a tent, and smote it that it fell, and
        overturned it, that the tent lay along.

007:014 And his fellow answered and said, This is nothing else save
        the sword of Gideon the son of Joash, a man of Israel: for
        into his hand hath God delivered Midian, and all the host.

007:015 And it was so, when Gideon heard the telling of the dream, and
        the interpretation thereof, that he worshipped, and returned
        into the host of Israel, and said, Arise; for the LORD hath
        delivered into your hand the host of Midian.

007:016 And he divided the three hundred men into three companies, and
        he put a trumpet in every man's hand, with empty pitchers, and
        lamps within the pitchers.

007:017 And he said unto them, Look on me, and do likewise: and,
        behold, when I come to the outside of the camp, it shall be
        that, as I do, so shall ye do.

007:018 When I blow with a trumpet, I and all that are with me, then
        blow ye the trumpets also on every side of all the camp, and
        say, The sword of the LORD, and of Gideon.

007:019 So Gideon, and the hundred men that were with him, came unto
        the outside of the camp in the beginning of the middle watch;
        and they had but newly set the watch: and they blew the
        trumpets, and brake the pitchers that were in their hands.

007:020 And the three companies blew the trumpets, and brake the
        pitchers, and held the lamps in their left hands, and the
        trumpets in their right hands to blow withal: and they cried,
        The sword of the LORD, and of Gideon.

007:021 And they stood every man in his place round about the camp;
        and all the host ran, and cried, and fled.

007:022 And the three hundred blew the trumpets, and the LORD set
        every man's sword against his fellow, even throughout all the
        host: and the host fled to Bethshittah in Zererath, and to the
        border of Abelmeholah, unto Tabbath.

007:023 And the men of Israel gathered themselves together out of
        Naphtali, and out of Asher, and out of all Manasseh, and
        pursued after the Midianites.

007:024 And Gideon sent messengers throughout all mount Ephraim,
        saying, come down against the Midianites, and take before them
        the waters unto Bethbarah and Jordan. Then all the men of
        Ephraim gathered themselves together, and took the waters unto
        Bethbarah and Jordan.

007:025 And they took two princes of the Midianites, Oreb and Zeeb;
        and they slew Oreb upon the rock Oreb, and Zeeb they slew at
        the winepress of Zeeb, and pursued Midian, and brought the
        heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon on the other side Jordan.

008:001 And the men of Ephraim said unto him, Why hast thou served us
        thus, that thou calledst us not, when thou wentest to fight
        with the Midianites? And they did chide with him sharply.

008:002 And he said unto them, What have I done now in comparison of
        you? Is not the gleaning of the grapes of Ephraim better than
        the vintage of Abiezer?

008:003 God hath delivered into your hands the princes of Midian, Oreb
        and Zeeb: and what was I able to do in comparison of you? Then
        their anger was abated toward him, when he had said that.

008:004 And Gideon came to Jordan, and passed over, he, and the three
        hundred men that were with him, faint, yet pursuing them.

008:005 And he said unto the men of Succoth, Give, I pray you, loaves
        of bread unto the people that follow me; for they be faint,
        and I am pursuing after Zebah and Zalmunna, kings of Midian.

008:006 And the princes of Succoth said, Are the hands of Zebah and
        Zalmunna now in thine hand, that we should give bread unto
        thine army?

008:007 And Gideon said, Therefore when the LORD hath delivered Zebah
        and Zalmunna into mine hand, then I will tear your flesh with
        the thorns of the wilderness and with briers.

008:008 And he went up thence to Penuel, and spake unto them likewise:
        and the men of Penuel answered him as the men of Succoth had
        answered him.

008:009 And he spake also unto the men of Penuel, saying, When I come
        again in peace, I will break down this tower.

008:010 Now Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor, and their hosts with
        them, about fifteen thousand men, all that were left of all
        the hosts of the children of the east: for there fell an
        hundred and twenty thousand men that drew sword.

008:011 And Gideon went up by the way of them that dwelt in tents on
        the east of Nobah and Jogbehah, and smote the host; for the
        host was secure.

008:012 And when Zebah and Zalmunna fled, he pursued after them, and
        took the two kings of Midian, Zebah and Zalmunna, and
        discomfited all the host.

008:013 And Gideon the son of Joash returned from battle before the
        sun was up,

008:014 And caught a young man of the men of Succoth, and enquired of
        him: and he described unto him the princes of Succoth, and the
        elders thereof, even threescore and seventeen men.

008:015 And he came unto the men of Succoth, and said, Behold Zebah
        and Zalmunna, with whom ye did upbraid me, saying, Are the
        hands of Zebah and Zalmunna now in thine hand, that we should
        give bread unto thy men that are weary?

008:016 And he took the elders of the city, and thorns of the
        wilderness and briers, and with them he taught the men of
        Succoth.

008:017 And he beat down the tower of Penuel, and slew the men of the
        city.

008:018 Then said he unto Zebah and Zalmunna, What manner of men were
        they whom ye slew at Tabor? And they answered, As thou art, so
        were they; each one resembled the children of a king.

008:019 And he said, They were my brethren, even the sons of my
        mother: as the LORD liveth, if ye had saved them alive, I
        would not slay you.

008:020 And he said unto Jether his firstborn, Up, and slay them. But
        the youth drew not his sword: for he feared, because he was
        yet a youth.

008:021 Then Zebah and Zalmunna said, Rise thou, and fall upon us: for
        as the man is, so is his strength. And Gideon arose, and slew
        Zebah and Zalmunna, and took away the ornaments that were on
        their camels' necks.

008:022 Then the men of Israel said unto Gideon, Rule thou over us,
        both thou, and thy son, and thy son's son also: for thou hast
        delivered us from the hand of Midian.

008:023 And Gideon said unto them, I will not rule over you, neither
        shall my son rule over you: the LORD shall rule over you.

008:024 And Gideon said unto them, I would desire a request of you,
        that ye would give me every man the earrings of his prey. (For
        they had golden earrings, because they were Ishmaelites.)

008:025 And they answered, We will willingly give them. And they
        spread a garment, and did cast therein every man the earrings
        of his prey.

008:026 And the weight of the golden earrings that he requested was a
        thousand and seven hundred shekels of gold; beside ornaments,
        and collars, and purple raiment that was on the kings of
        Midian, and beside the chains that were about their camels'
        necks.

008:027 And Gideon made an ephod thereof, and put it in his city, even
        in Ophrah: and all Israel went thither a whoring after it:
        which thing became a snare unto Gideon, and to his house.

008:028 Thus was Midian subdued before the children of Israel, so that
        they lifted up their heads no more. And the country was in
        quietness forty years in the days of Gideon.

008:029 And Jerubbaal the son of Joash went and dwelt in his own
        house.

008:030 And Gideon had threescore and ten sons of his body begotten:
        for he had many wives.

008:031 And his concubine that was in Shechem, she also bare him a
        son, whose name he called Abimelech.

008:032 And Gideon the son of Joash died in a good old age, and was
        buried in the sepulchre of Joash his father, in Ophrah of the
        Abiezrites.

008:033 And it came to pass, as soon as Gideon was dead, that the
        children of Israel turned again, and went a whoring after
        Baalim, and made Baalberith their god.

008:034 And the children of Israel remembered not the LORD their God,
        who had delivered them out of the hands of all their enemies
        on every side:

008:035 Neither shewed they kindness to the house of Jerubbaal,
        namely, Gideon, according to all the goodness which he had
        shewed unto Israel.

009:001 And Abimelech the son of Jerubbaal went to Shechem unto his
        mother's brethren, and communed with them, and with all the
        family of the house of his mother's father, saying,

009:002 Speak, I pray you, in the ears of all the men of Shechem,
        Whether is better for you, either that all the sons of
        Jerubbaal, which are threescore and ten persons, reign over
        you, or that one reign over you? remember also that I am your
        bone and your flesh.

009:003 And his mother's brethren spake of him in the ears of all the
        men of Shechem all these words: and their hearts inclined to
        follow Abimelech; for they said, He is our brother.

009:004 And they gave him threescore and ten pieces of silver out of
        the house of Baalberith, wherewith Abimelech hired vain and
        light persons, which followed him.

009:005 And he went unto his father's house at Ophrah, and slew his
        brethren the sons of Jerubbaal, being threescore and ten
        persons, upon one stone: notwithstanding yet Jotham the
        youngest son of Jerubbaal was left; for he hid himself.

009:006 And all the men of Shechem gathered together, and all the
        house of Millo, and went, and made Abimelech king, by the
        plain of the pillar that was in Shechem.

009:007 And when they told it to Jotham, he went and stood in the top
        of mount Gerizim, and lifted up his voice, and cried, and said
        unto them, Hearken unto me, ye men of Shechem, that God may
        hearken unto you.

009:008 The trees went forth on a time to anoint a king over them; and
        they said unto the olive tree, Reign thou over us.

009:009 But the olive tree said unto them, Should I leave my fatness,
        wherewith by me they honour God and man, and go to be promoted
        over the trees?

009:010 And the trees said to the fig tree, Come thou, and reign over
        us.

009:011 But the fig tree said unto them, Should I forsake my
        sweetness, and my good fruit, and go to be promoted over the
        trees?

009:012 Then said the trees unto the vine, Come thou, and reign over
        us.

009:013 And the vine said unto them, Should I leave my wine, which
        cheereth God and man, and go to be promoted over the trees?

009:014 Then said all the trees unto the bramble, Come thou, and reign
        over us.

009:015 And the bramble said unto the trees, If in truth ye anoint me
        king over you, then come and put your trust in my shadow: and
        if not, let fire come out of the bramble, and devour the
        cedars of Lebanon.

009:016 Now therefore, if ye have done truly and sincerely, in that ye
        have made Abimelech king, and if ye have dealt well with
        Jerubbaal and his house, and have done unto him according to
        the deserving of his hands;

009:017 (For my father fought for you, and adventured his life far,
        and delivered you out of the hand of Midian:

009:018 And ye are risen up against my father's house this day, and
        have slain his sons, threescore and ten persons, upon one
        stone, and have made Abimelech, the son of his maidservant,
        king over the men of Shechem, because he is your brother;)

009:019 If ye then have dealt truly and sincerely with Jerubbaal and
        with his house this day, then rejoice ye in Abimelech, and let
        him also rejoice in you:

009:020 But if not, let fire come out from Abimelech, and devour the
        men of Shechem, and the house of Millo; and let fire come out
        from the men of Shechem, and from the house of Millo, and
        devour Abimelech.

009:021 And Jotham ran away, and fled, and went to Beer, and dwelt
        there, for fear of Abimelech his brother.

009:022 When Abimelech had reigned three years over Israel,

009:023 Then God sent an evil spirit between Abimelech and the men of
        Shechem; and the men of Shechem dealt treacherously with
        Abimelech:

009:024 That the cruelty done to the threescore and ten sons of
        Jerubbaal might come, and their blood be laid upon Abimelech
        their brother, which slew them; and upon the men of Shechem,
        which aided him in the killing of his brethren.

009:025 And the men of Shechem set liers in wait for him in the top of
        the mountains, and they robbed all that came along that way by
        them: and it was told Abimelech.

009:026 And Gaal the son of Ebed came with his brethren, and went over
        to Shechem: and the men of Shechem put their confidence in
        him.

009:027 And they went out into the fields, and gathered their
        vineyards, and trode the grapes, and made merry, and went into
        the house of their god, and did eat and drink, and cursed
        Abimelech.

009:028 And Gaal the son of Ebed said, Who is Abimelech, and who is
        Shechem, that we should serve him? is not he the son of
        Jerubbaal? and Zebul his officer? serve the men of Hamor the
        father of Shechem: for why should we serve him?

009:029 And would to God this people were under my hand! then would I
        remove Abimelech. And he said to Abimelech, Increase thine
        army, and come out.

009:030 And when Zebul the ruler of the city heard the words of Gaal
        the son of Ebed, his anger was kindled.

009:031 And he sent messengers unto Abimelech privily, saying, Behold,
        Gaal the son of Ebed and his brethren be come to Shechem; and,
        behold, they fortify the city against thee.

009:032 Now therefore up by night, thou and the people that is with
        thee, and lie in wait in the field:

009:033 And it shall be, that in the morning, as soon as the sun is
        up, thou shalt rise early, and set upon the city: and, behold,
        when he and the people that is with him come out against thee,
        then mayest thou do to them as thou shalt find occasion.

009:034 And Abimelech rose up, and all the people that were with him,
        by night, and they laid wait against Shechem in four
        companies.

009:035 And Gaal the son of Ebed went out, and stood in the entering
        of the gate of the city: and Abimelech rose up, and the people
        that were with him, from lying in wait.

009:036 And when Gaal saw the people, he said to Zebul, Behold, there
        come people down from the top of the mountains. And Zebul said
        unto him, Thou seest the shadow of the mountains as if they
        were men.

009:037 And Gaal spake again, and said, See there come people down by
        the middle of the land, and another company come along by the
        plain of Meonenim.

009:038 Then said Zebul unto him, Where is now thy mouth, wherewith
        thou saidst, Who is Abimelech, that we should serve him? is
        not this the people that thou hast despised? go out, I pray
        now, and fight with them.

009:039 And Gaal went out before the men of Shechem, and fought with
        Abimelech.

009:040 And Abimelech chased him, and he fled before him, and many
        were overthrown and wounded, even unto the entering of the
        gate.

009:041 And Abimelech dwelt at Arumah: and Zebul thrust out Gaal and
        his brethren, that they should not dwell in Shechem.

009:042 And it came to pass on the morrow, that the people went out
        into the field; and they told Abimelech.

009:043 And he took the people, and divided them into three companies,
        and laid wait in the field, and looked, and, behold, the
        people were come forth out of the city; and he rose up against
        them, and smote them.

009:044 And Abimelech, and the company that was with him, rushed
        forward, and stood in the entering of the gate of the city:
        and the two other companies ran upon all the people that were
        in the fields, and slew them.

009:045 And Abimelech fought against the city all that day; and he
        took the city, and slew the people that was therein, and beat
        down the city, and sowed it with salt.

009:046 And when all the men of the tower of Shechem heard that, they
        entered into an hold of the house of the god Berith.

009:047 And it was told Abimelech, that all the men of the tower of
        Shechem were gathered together.

009:048 And Abimelech gat him up to mount Zalmon, he and all the
        people that were with him; and Abimelech took an axe in his
        hand, and cut down a bough from the trees, and took it, and
        laid it on his shoulder, and said unto the people that were
        with him, What ye have seen me do, make haste, and do as I
        have done.

009:049 And all the people likewise cut down every man his bough, and
        followed Abimelech, and put them to the hold, and set the hold
        on fire upon them; so that all the men of the tower of Shechem
        died also, about a thousand men and women.

009:050 Then went Abimelech to Thebez, and encamped against Thebez,
        and took it.

009:051 But there was a strong tower within the city, and thither fled
        all the men and women, and all they of the city, and shut it
        to them, and gat them up to the top of the tower.

009:052 And Abimelech came unto the tower, and fought against it, and
        went hard unto the door of the tower to burn it with fire.

009:053 And a certain woman cast a piece of a millstone upon
        Abimelech's head, and all to brake his skull.

009:054 Then he called hastily unto the young man his armourbearer,
        and said unto him, Draw thy sword, and slay me, that men say
        not of me, A women slew him. And his young man thrust him
        through, and he died.

009:055 And when the men of Israel saw that Abimelech was dead, they
        departed every man unto his place.

009:056 Thus God rendered the wickedness of Abimelech, which he did
        unto his father, in slaying his seventy brethren:

009:057 And all the evil of the men of Shechem did God render upon
        their heads: and upon them came the curse of Jotham the son of
        Jerubbaal.

010:001 And after Abimelech there arose to defend Israel Tola the son
        of Puah, the son of Dodo, a man of Issachar; and he dwelt in
        Shamir in mount Ephraim.

010:002 And he judged Israel twenty and three years, and died, and was
        buried in Shamir.

010:003 And after him arose Jair, a Gileadite, and judged Israel
        twenty and two years.

010:004 And he had thirty sons that rode on thirty ass colts, and they
        had thirty cities, which are called Havothjair unto this day,
        which are in the land of Gilead.

010:005 And Jair died, and was buried in Camon.

010:006 And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the
        LORD, and served Baalim, and Ashtaroth, and the gods of Syria,
        and the gods of Zidon, and the gods of Moab, and the gods of
        the children of Ammon, and the gods of the Philistines, and
        forsook the LORD, and served not him.

010:007 And the anger of the LORD was hot against Israel, and he sold
        them into the hands of the Philistines, and into the hands of
        the children of Ammon.

010:008 And that year they vexed and oppressed the children of Israel:
        eighteen years, all the children of Israel that were on the
        other side Jordan in the land of the Amorites, which is in
        Gilead.

010:009 Moreover the children of Ammon passed over Jordan to fight
        also against Judah, and against Benjamin, and against the
        house of Ephraim; so that Israel was sore distressed.

010:010 And the children of Israel cried unto the LORD, saying, We
        have sinned against thee, both because we have forsaken our
        God, and also served Baalim.

010:011 And the LORD said unto the children of Israel, Did not I
        deliver you from the Egyptians, and from the Amorites, from
        the children of Ammon, and from the Philistines?

010:012 The Zidonians also, and the Amalekites, and the Maonites, did
        oppress you; and ye cried to me, and I delivered you out of
        their hand.

010:013 Yet ye have forsaken me, and served other gods: wherefore I
        will deliver you no more.

010:014 Go and cry unto the gods which ye have chosen; let them
        deliver you in the time of your tribulation.

010:015 And the children of Israel said unto the LORD, We have sinned:
        do thou unto us whatsoever seemeth good unto thee; deliver us
        only, we pray thee, this day.

010:016 And they put away the strange gods from among them, and served
        the LORD: and his soul was grieved for the misery of Israel.

010:017 Then the children of Ammon were gathered together, and
        encamped in Gilead. And the children of Israel assembled
        themselves together, and encamped in Mizpeh.

010:018 And the people and princes of Gilead said one to another, What
        man is he that will begin to fight against the children of
        Ammon? he shall be head over all the inhabitants of Gilead.

011:001 Now Jephthah the Gileadite was a mighty man of valour, and he
        was the son of an harlot: and Gilead begat Jephthah.

011:002 And Gilead's wife bare him sons; and his wife's sons grew up,
        and they thrust out Jephthah, and said unto him, Thou shalt
        not inherit in our father's house; for thou art the son of a
        strange woman.

011:003 Then Jephthah fled from his brethren, and dwelt in the land of
        Tob: and there were gathered vain men to Jephthah, and went
        out with him.

011:004 And it came to pass in process of time, that the children of
        Ammon made war against Israel.

011:005 And it was so, that when the children of Ammon made war
        against Israel, the elders of Gilead went to fetch Jephthah
        out of the land of Tob:

011:006 And they said unto Jephthah, Come, and be our captain, that we
        may fight with the children of Ammon.

011:007 And Jephthah said unto the elders of Gilead, Did not ye hate
        me, and expel me out of my father's house? and why are ye come
        unto me now when ye are in distress?

011:008 And the elders of Gilead said unto Jephthah, Therefore we turn
        again to thee now, that thou mayest go with us, and fight
        against the children of Ammon, and be our head over all the
        inhabitants of Gilead.

011:009 And Jephthah said unto the elders of Gilead, If ye bring me
        home again to fight against the children of Ammon, and the
        LORD deliver them before me, shall I be your head?

011:010 And the elders of Gilead said unto Jephthah, The LORD be
        witness between us, if we do not so according to thy words.

011:011 Then Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead, and the people
        made him head and captain over them: and Jephthah uttered all
        his words before the LORD in Mizpeh.

011:012 And Jephthah sent messengers unto the king of the children of
        Ammon, saying, What hast thou to do with me, that thou art
        come against me to fight in my land?

011:013 And the king of the children of Ammon answered unto the
        messengers of Jephthah, Because Israel took away my land, when
        they came up out of Egypt, from Arnon even unto Jabbok, and
        unto Jordan: now therefore restore those lands again
        peaceably.

011:014 And Jephthah sent messengers again unto the king of the
        children of Ammon:

011:015 And said unto him, Thus saith Jephthah, Israel took not away
        the land of Moab, nor the land of the children of Ammon:

011:016 But when Israel came up from Egypt, and walked through the
        wilderness unto the Red sea, and came to Kadesh;

011:017 Then Israel sent messengers unto the king of Edom, saying, Let
        me, I pray thee, pass through thy land: but the king of Edom
        would not hearken thereto. And in like manner they sent unto
        the king of Moab: but he would not consent: and Israel abode
        in Kadesh.

011:018 Then they went along through the wilderness, and compassed the
        land of Edom, and the land of Moab, and came by the east side
        of the land of Moab, and pitched on the other side of Arnon,
        but came not within the border of Moab: for Arnon was the
        border of Moab.

011:019 And Israel sent messengers unto Sihon king of the Amorites,
        the king of Heshbon; and Israel said unto him, Let us pass, we
        pray thee, through thy land into my place.

011:020 But Sihon trusted not Israel to pass through his coast: but
        Sihon gathered all his people together, and pitched in Jahaz,
        and fought against Israel.

011:021 And the LORD God of Israel delivered Sihon and all his people
        into the hand of Israel, and they smote them: so Israel
        possessed all the land of the Amorites, the inhabitants of
        that country.

011:022 And they possessed all the coasts of the Amorites, from Arnon
        even unto Jabbok, and from the wilderness even unto Jordan.

011:023 So now the LORD God of Israel hath dispossessed the Amorites
        from before his people Israel, and shouldest thou possess it?

011:024 Wilt not thou possess that which Chemosh thy god giveth thee
        to possess? So whomsoever the LORD our God shall drive out
        from before us, them will we possess.

011:025 And now art thou any thing better than Balak the son of
        Zippor, king of Moab? did he ever strive against Israel, or
        did he ever fight against them,

011:026 While Israel dwelt in Heshbon and her towns, and in Aroer and
        her towns, and in all the cities that be along by the coasts
        of Arnon, three hundred years? why therefore did ye not
        recover them within that time?

011:027 Wherefore I have not sinned against thee, but thou doest me
        wrong to war against me: the LORD the Judge be judge this day
        between the children of Israel and the children of Ammon.

011:028 Howbeit the king of the children of Ammon hearkened not unto
        the words of Jephthah which he sent him.

011:029 Then the Spirit of the LORD came upon Jephthah, and he passed
        over Gilead, and Manasseh, and passed over Mizpeh of Gilead,
        and from Mizpeh of Gilead he passed over unto the children of
        Ammon.

011:030 And Jephthah vowed a vow unto the LORD, and said, If thou
        shalt without fail deliver the children of Ammon into mine
        hands,

011:031 Then it shall be, that whatsoever cometh forth of the doors of
        my house to meet me, when I return in peace from the children
        of Ammon, shall surely be the LORD's, and I will offer it up
        for a burnt offering.

011:032 So Jephthah passed over unto the children of Ammon to fight
        against them; and the LORD delivered them into his hands.

011:033 And he smote them from Aroer, even till thou come to Minnith,
        even twenty cities, and unto the plain of the vineyards, with
        a very great slaughter. Thus the children of Ammon were
        subdued before the children of Israel.

011:034 And Jephthah came to Mizpeh unto his house, and, behold, his
        daughter came out to meet him with timbrels and with dances:
        and she was his only child; beside her he had neither son nor
        daughter.

011:035 And it came to pass, when he saw her, that he rent his
        clothes, and said, Alas, my daughter! thou hast brought me
        very low, and thou art one of them that trouble me: for I have
        opened my mouth unto the LORD, and I cannot go back.

011:036 And she said unto him, My father, if thou hast opened thy
        mouth unto the LORD, do to me according to that which hath
        proceeded out of thy mouth; forasmuch as the LORD hath taken
        vengeance for thee of thine enemies, even of the children of
        Ammon.

011:037 And she said unto her father, Let this thing be done for me:
        let me alone two months, that I may go up and down upon the
        mountains, and bewail my virginity, I and my fellows.

011:038 And he said, Go. And he sent her away for two months: and she
        went with her companions, and bewailed her virginity upon the
        mountains.

011:039 And it came to pass at the end of two months, that she
        returned unto her father, who did with her according to his
        vow which he had vowed: and she knew no man. And it was a
        custom in Israel,

011:040 That the daughters of Israel went yearly to lament the
        daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite four days in a year.

012:001 And the men of Ephraim gathered themselves together, and went
        northward, and said unto Jephthah, Wherefore passedst thou
        over to fight against the children of Ammon, and didst not
        call us to go with thee? we will burn thine house upon thee
        with fire.

012:002 And Jephthah said unto them, I and my people were at great
        strife with the children of Ammon; and when I called you, ye
        delivered me not out of their hands.

012:003 And when I saw that ye delivered me not, I put my life in my
        hands, and passed over against the children of Ammon, and the
        LORD delivered them into my hand: wherefore then are ye come
        up unto me this day, to fight against me?

012:004 Then Jephthah gathered together all the men of Gilead, and
        fought with Ephraim: and the men of Gilead smote Ephraim,
        because they said, Ye Gileadites are fugitives of Ephraim
        among the Ephraimites, and among the Manassites.

012:005 And the Gileadites took the passages of Jordan before the
        Ephraimites: and it was so, that when those Ephraimites which
        were escaped said, Let me go over; that the men of Gilead said
        unto him, Art thou an Ephraimite? If he said, Nay;

012:006 Then said they unto him, Say now Shibboleth: and he said
        Sibboleth: for he could not frame to pronounce it right. Then
        they took him, and slew him at the passages of Jordan: and
        there fell at that time of the Ephraimites forty and two
        thousand.

012:007 And Jephthah judged Israel six years. Then died Jephthah the
        Gileadite, and was buried in one of the cities of Gilead.

012:008 And after him Ibzan of Bethlehem judged Israel.

012:009 And he had thirty sons, and thirty daughters, whom he sent
        abroad, and took in thirty daughters from abroad for his sons.
        And he judged Israel seven years.

012:010 Then died Ibzan, and was buried at Bethlehem.

012:011 And after him Elon, a Zebulonite, judged Israel; and he judged
        Israel ten years.

012:012 And Elon the Zebulonite died, and was buried in Aijalon in the
        country of Zebulun.

012:013 And after him Abdon the son of Hillel, a Pirathonite, judged
        Israel.

012:014 And he had forty sons and thirty nephews, that rode on
        threescore and ten ass colts: and he judged Israel eight
        years.

012:015 And Abdon the son of Hillel the Pirathonite died, and was
        buried in Pirathon in the land of Ephraim, in the mount of the
        Amalekites.

013:001 And the children of Israel did evil again in the sight of the
        LORD; and the LORD delivered them into the hand of the
        Philistines forty years.

013:002 And there was a certain man of Zorah, of the family of the
        Danites, whose name was Manoah; and his wife was barren, and
        bare not.

013:003 And the angel of the LORD appeared unto the woman, and said
        unto her, Behold now, thou art barren, and bearest not: but
        thou shalt conceive, and bear a son.

013:004 Now therefore beware, I pray thee, and drink not wine nor
        strong drink, and eat not any unclean thing:

013:005 For, lo, thou shalt conceive, and bear a son; and no razor
        shall come on his head: for the child shall be a Nazarite unto
        God from the womb: and he shall begin to deliver Israel out of
        the hand of the Philistines.

013:006 Then the woman came and told her husband, saying, A man of God
        came unto me, and his countenance was like the countenance of
        an angel of God, very terrible: but I asked him not whence he
        was, neither told he me his name:

013:007 But he said unto me, Behold, thou shalt conceive, and bear a
        son; and now drink no wine nor strong drink, neither eat any
        unclean thing: for the child shall be a Nazarite to God from
        the womb to the day of his death.

013:008 Then Manoah intreated the LORD, and said, O my Lord, let the
        man of God which thou didst send come again unto us, and teach
        us what we shall do unto the child that shall be born.

013:009 And God hearkened to the voice of Manoah; and the angel of God
        came again unto the woman as she sat in the field: but Manoah
        her husband was not with her.

013:010 And the woman made haste, and ran, and shewed her husband, and
        said unto him, Behold, the man hath appeared unto me, that
        came unto me the other day.

013:011 And Manoah arose, and went after his wife, and came to the
        man, and said unto him, Art thou the man that spakest unto the
        woman? And he said, I am.

013:012 And Manoah said, Now let thy words come to pass. How shall we
        order the child, and how shall we do unto him?

013:013 And the angel of the LORD said unto Manoah, Of all that I said
        unto the woman let her beware.

013:014 She may not eat of any thing that cometh of the vine, neither
        let her drink wine or strong drink, nor eat any unclean thing:
        all that I commanded her let her observe.

013:015 And Manoah said unto the angel of the LORD, I pray thee, let
        us detain thee, until we shall have made ready a kid for thee.

013:016 And the angel of the LORD said unto Manoah, Though thou detain
        me, I will not eat of thy bread: and if thou wilt offer a
        burnt offering, thou must offer it unto the LORD. For Manoah
        knew not that he was an angel of the LORD.

013:017 And Manoah said unto the angel of the LORD, What is thy name,
        that when thy sayings come to pass we may do thee honour?

013:018 And the angel of the LORD said unto him, Why askest thou thus
        after my name, seeing it is secret?

013:019 So Manoah took a kid with a meat offering, and offered it upon
        a rock unto the LORD: and the angel did wonderously; and
        Manoah and his wife looked on.

013:020 For it came to pass, when the flame went up toward heaven from
        off the altar, that the angel of the LORD ascended in the
        flame of the altar. And Manoah and his wife looked on it, and
        fell on their faces to the ground.

013:021 But the angel of the LORD did no more appear to Manoah and to
        his wife. Then Manoah knew that he was an angel of the LORD.

013:022 And Manoah said unto his wife, We shall surely die, because we
        have seen God.

013:023 But his wife said unto him, If the LORD were pleased to kill
        us, he would not have received a burnt offering and a meat
        offering at our hands, neither would he have shewed us all
        these things, nor would as at this time have told us such
        things as these.

013:024 And the woman bare a son, and called his name Samson: and the
        child grew, and the LORD blessed him.

013:025 And the Spirit of the LORD began to move him at times in the
        camp of Dan between Zorah and Eshtaol.

014:001 And Samson went down to Timnath, and saw a woman in Timnath of
        the daughters of the Philistines.

014:002 And he came up, and told his father and his mother, and said,
        I have seen a woman in Timnath of the daughters of the
        Philistines: now therefore get her for me to wife.

014:003 Then his father and his mother said unto him, Is there never a
        woman among the daughters of thy brethren, or among all my
        people, that thou goest to take a wife of the uncircumcised
        Philistines? And Samson said unto his father, Get her for me;
        for she pleaseth me well.

014:004 But his father and his mother knew not that it was of the
        LORD, that he sought an occasion against the Philistines: for
        at that time the Philistines had dominion over Israel.

014:005 Then went Samson down, and his father and his mother, to
        Timnath, and came to the vineyards of Timnath: and, behold, a
        young lion roared against him.

014:006 And the Spirit of the LORD came mightily upon him, and he rent
        him as he would have rent a kid, and he had nothing in his
        hand: but he told not his father or his mother what he had
        done.

014:007 And he went down, and talked with the woman; and she pleased
        Samson well.

014:008 And after a time he returned to take her, and he turned aside
        to see the carcase of the lion: and, behold, there was a swarm
        of bees and honey in the carcase of the lion.

014:009 And he took thereof in his hands, and went on eating, and came
        to his father and mother, and he gave them, and they did eat:
        but he told not them that he had taken the honey out of the
        carcase of the lion.

014:010 So his father went down unto the woman: and Samson made there
        a feast; for so used the young men to do.

014:011 And it came to pass, when they saw him, that they brought
        thirty companions to be with him.

014:012 And Samson said unto them, I will now put forth a riddle unto
        you: if ye can certainly declare it me within the seven days
        of the feast, and find it out, then I will give you thirty
        sheets and thirty change of garments:

014:013 But if ye cannot declare it me, then shall ye give me thirty
        sheets and thirty change of garments. And they said unto him,
        Put forth thy riddle, that we may hear it.

014:014 And he said unto them, Out of the eater came forth meat, and
        out of the strong came forth sweetness. And they could not in
        three days expound the riddle.

014:015 And it came to pass on the seventh day, that they said unto
        Samson's wife, Entice thy husband, that he may declare unto us
        the riddle, lest we burn thee and thy father's house with
        fire: have ye called us to take that we have? is it not so?

014:016 And Samson's wife wept before him, and said, Thou dost but
        hate me, and lovest me not: thou hast put forth a riddle unto
        the children of my people, and hast not told it me. And he
        said unto her, Behold, I have not told it my father nor my
        mother, and shall I tell it thee?

014:017 And she wept before him the seven days, while their feast
        lasted: and it came to pass on the seventh day, that he told
        her, because she lay sore upon him: and she told the riddle to
        the children of her people.

014:018 And the men of the city said unto him on the seventh day
        before the sun went down, What is sweeter than honey? And what
        is stronger than a lion? and he said unto them, If ye had not
        plowed with my heifer, ye had not found out my riddle.

014:019 And the Spirit of the LORD came upon him, and he went down to
        Ashkelon, and slew thirty men of them, and took their spoil,
        and gave change of garments unto them which expounded the
        riddle. And his anger was kindled, and he went up to his
        father's house.

014:020 But Samson's wife was given to his companion, whom he had used
        as his friend.

015:001 But it came to pass within a while after, in the time of wheat
        harvest, that Samson visited his wife with a kid; and he said,
        I will go in to my wife into the chamber. But her father would
        not suffer him to go in.

015:002 And her father said, I verily thought that thou hadst utterly
        hated her; therefore I gave her to thy companion: is not her
        younger sister fairer than she? take her, I pray thee, instead
        of her.

015:003 And Samson said concerning them, Now shall I be more blameless
        than the Philistines, though I do them a displeasure.

015:004 And Samson went and caught three hundred foxes, and took
        firebrands, and turned tail to tail, and put a firebrand in
        the midst between two tails.

015:005 And when he had set the brands on fire, he let them go into
        the standing corn of the Philistines, and burnt up both the
        shocks, and also the standing corn, with the vineyards and
        olives.

015:006 Then the Philistines said, Who hath done this? And they
        answered, Samson, the son in law of the Timnite, because he
        had taken his wife, and given her to his companion. And the
        Philistines came up, and burnt her and her father with fire.

015:007 And Samson said unto them, Though ye have done this, yet will
        I be avenged of you, and after that I will cease.

015:008 And he smote them hip and thigh with a great slaughter: and he
        went down and dwelt in the top of the rock Etam.

015:009 Then the Philistines went up, and pitched in Judah, and spread
        themselves in Lehi.

015:010 And the men of Judah said, Why are ye come up against us? And
        they answered, To bind Samson are we come up, to do to him as
        he hath done to us.

015:011 Then three thousand men of Judah went to the top of the rock
        Etam, and said to Samson, Knowest thou not that the
        Philistines are rulers over us? what is this that thou hast
        done unto us? And he said unto them, As they did unto me, so
        have I done unto them.

015:012 And they said unto him, We are come down to bind thee, that we
        may deliver thee into the hand of the Philistines. And Samson
        said unto them, Swear unto me, that ye will not fall upon me
        yourselves.

015:013 And they spake unto him, saying, No; but we will bind thee
        fast, and deliver thee into their hand: but surely we will not
        kill thee. And they bound him with two new cords, and brought
        him up from the rock.

015:014 And when he came unto Lehi, the Philistines shouted against
        him: and the Spirit of the LORD came mightily upon him, and
        the cords that were upon his arms became as flax that was
        burnt with fire, and his bands loosed from off his hands.

015:015 And he found a new jawbone of an ass, and put forth his hand,
        and took it, and slew a thousand men therewith.

015:016 And Samson said, With the jawbone of an ass, heaps upon heaps,
        with the jaw of an ass have I slain a thousand men.

015:017 And it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking, that
        he cast away the jawbone out of his hand, and called that
        place Ramathlehi.

015:018 And he was sore athirst, and called on the LORD, and said,
        Thou hast given this great deliverance into the hand of thy
        servant: and now shall I die for thirst, and fall into the
        hand of the uncircumcised?

015:019 But God clave an hollow place that was in the jaw, and there
        came water thereout; and when he had drunk, his spirit came
        again, and he revived: wherefore he called the name thereof
        Enhakkore, which is in Lehi unto this day.

015:020 And he judged Israel in the days of the Philistines twenty
        years.

016:001 Then went Samson to Gaza, and saw there an harlot, and went in
        unto her.

016:002 And it was told the Gazites, saying, Samson is come hither.
        And they compassed him in, and laid wait for him all night in
        the gate of the city, and were quiet all the night, saying, In
        the morning, when it is day, we shall kill him.

016:003 And Samson lay till midnight, and arose at midnight, and took
        the doors of the gate of the city, and the two posts, and went
        away with them, bar and all, and put them upon his shoulders,
        and carried them up to the top of an hill that is before
        Hebron.

016:004 And it came to pass afterward, that he loved a woman in the
        valley of Sorek, whose name was Delilah.

016:005 And the lords of the Philistines came up unto her, and said
        unto her, Entice him, and see wherein his great strength
        lieth, and by what means we may prevail against him, that we
        may bind him to afflict him; and we will give thee every one
        of us eleven hundred pieces of silver.

016:006 And Delilah said to Samson, Tell me, I pray thee, wherein thy
        great strength lieth, and wherewith thou mightest be bound to
        afflict thee.

016:007 And Samson said unto her, If they bind me with seven green
        withs that were never dried, then shall I be weak, and be as
        another man.

016:008 Then the lords of the Philistines brought up to her seven
        green withs which had not been dried, and she bound him with
        them.

016:009 Now there were men lying in wait, abiding with her in the
        chamber. And she said unto him, The Philistines be upon thee,
        Samson. And he brake the withs, as a thread of tow is broken
        when it toucheth the fire. So his strength was not known.

016:010 And Delilah said unto Samson, Behold, thou hast mocked me, and
        told me lies: now tell me, I pray thee, wherewith thou
        mightest be bound.

016:011 And he said unto her, If they bind me fast with new ropes that
        never were occupied, then shall I be weak, and be as another
        man.

016:012 Delilah therefore took new ropes, and bound him therewith, and
        said unto him, The Philistines be upon thee, Samson. And there
        were liers in wait abiding in the chamber. And he brake them
        from off his arms like a thread.

016:013 And Delilah said unto Samson, Hitherto thou hast mocked me,
        and told me lies: tell me wherewith thou mightest be bound.
        And he said unto her, If thou weavest the seven locks of my
        head with the web.

016:014 And she fastened it with the pin, and said unto him, The
        Philistines be upon thee, Samson. And he awaked out of his
        sleep, and went away with the pin of the beam, and with the
        web.

016:015 And she said unto him, How canst thou say, I love thee, when
        thine heart is not with me? thou hast mocked me these three
        times, and hast not told me wherein thy great strength lieth.

016:016 And it came to pass, when she pressed him daily with her
        words, and urged him, so that his soul was vexed unto death;

016:017 That he told her all his heart, and said unto her, There hath
        not come a razor upon mine head; for I have been a Nazarite
        unto God from my mother's womb: if I be shaven, then my
        strength will go from me, and I shall become weak, and be like
        any other man.

016:018 And when Delilah saw that he had told her all his heart, she
        sent and called for the lords of the Philistines, saying, Come
        up this once, for he hath shewed me all his heart. Then the
        lords of the Philistines came up unto her, and brought money
        in their hand.

016:019 And she made him sleep upon her knees; and she called for a
        man, and she caused him to shave off the seven locks of his
        head; and she began to afflict him, and his strength went from
        him.

016:020 And she said, The Philistines be upon thee, Samson. And he
        awoke out of his sleep, and said, I will go out as at other
        times before, and shake myself. And he wist not that the LORD
        was departed from him.

016:021 But the Philistines took him, and put out his eyes, and
        brought him down to Gaza, and bound him with fetters of brass;
        and he did grind in the prison house.

016:022 Howbeit the hair of his head began to grow again after he was
        shaven.

016:023 Then the lords of the Philistines gathered them together for
        to offer a great sacrifice unto Dagon their god, and to
        rejoice: for they said, Our god hath delivered Samson our
        enemy into our hand.

016:024 And when the people saw him, they praised their god: for they
        said, Our god hath delivered into our hands our enemy, and the
        destroyer of our country, which slew many of us.

016:025 And it came to pass, when their hearts were merry, that they
        said, Call for Samson, that he may make us sport. And they
        called for Samson out of the prison house; and he made them
        sport: and they set him between the pillars.

016:026 And Samson said unto the lad that held him by the hand, Suffer
        me that I may feel the pillars whereupon the house standeth,
        that I may lean upon them.

016:027 Now the house was full of men and women; and all the lords of
        the Philistines were there; and there were upon the roof about
        three thousand men and women, that beheld while Samson made
        sport.

016:028 And Samson called unto the LORD, and said, O Lord God,
        remember me, I pray thee, and strengthen me, I pray thee, only
        this once, O God, that I may be at once avenged of the
        Philistines for my two eyes.

016:029 And Samson took hold of the two middle pillars upon which the
        house stood, and on which it was borne up, of the one with his
        right hand, and of the other with his left.

016:030 And Samson said, Let me die with the Philistines. And he bowed
        himself with all his might; and the house fell upon the lords,
        and upon all the people that were therein. So the dead which
        he slew at his death were more than they which he slew in his
        life.

016:031 Then his brethren and all the house of his father came down,
        and took him, and brought him up, and buried him between Zorah
        and Eshtaol in the buryingplace of Manoah his father. And he
        judged Israel twenty years.

017:001 And there was a man of mount Ephraim, whose name was Micah.

017:002 And he said unto his mother, The eleven hundred shekels of
        silver that were taken from thee, about which thou cursedst,
        and spakest of also in mine ears, behold, the silver is with
        me; I took it. And his mother said, Blessed be thou of the
        LORD, my son.

017:003 And when he had restored the eleven hundred shekels of silver
        to his mother, his mother said, I had wholly dedicated the
        silver unto the LORD from my hand for my son, to make a graven
        image and a molten image: now therefore I will restore it unto
        thee.

017:004 Yet he restored the money unto his mother; and his mother took
        two hundred shekels of silver, and gave them to the founder,
        who made thereof a graven image and a molten image: and they
        were in the house of Micah.

017:005 And the man Micah had an house of gods, and made an ephod, and
        teraphim, and consecrated one of his sons, who became his
        priest.

017:006 In those days there was no king in Israel, but every man did
        that which was right in his own eyes.

017:007 And there was a young man out of Bethlehemjudah of the family
        of Judah, who was a Levite, and he sojourned there.

017:008 And the man departed out of the city from Bethlehemjudah to
        sojourn where he could find a place: and he came to mount
        Ephraim to the house of Micah, as he journeyed.

017:009 And Micah said unto him, Whence comest thou? And he said unto
        him, I am a Levite of Bethlehemjudah, and I go to sojourn
        where I may find a place.

017:010 And Micah said unto him, Dwell with me, and be unto me a
        father and a priest, and I will give thee ten shekels of
        silver by the year, and a suit of apparel, and thy victuals.
        So the Levite went in.

017:011 And the Levite was content to dwell with the man; and the
        young man was unto him as one of his sons.

017:012 And Micah consecrated the Levite; and the young man became his
        priest, and was in the house of Micah.

017:013 Then said Micah, Now know I that the LORD will do me good,
        seeing I have a Levite to my priest.

018:001 In those days there was no king in Israel: and in those days
        the tribe of the Danites sought them an inheritance to dwell
        in; for unto that day all their inheritance had not fallen
        unto them among the tribes of Israel.

018:002 And the children of Dan sent of their family five men from
        their coasts, men of valour, from Zorah, and from Eshtaol, to
        spy out the land, and to search it; and they said unto them,
        Go, search the land: who when they came to mount Ephraim, to
        the house of Micah, they lodged there.

018:003 When they were by the house of Micah, they knew the voice of
        the young man the Levite: and they turned in thither, and said
        unto him, Who brought thee hither? and what makest thou in
        this place? and what hast thou here?

018:004 And he said unto them, Thus and thus dealeth Micah with me,
        and hath hired me, and I am his priest.

018:005 And they said unto him, Ask counsel, we pray thee, of God,
        that we may know whether our way which we go shall be
        prosperous.

018:006 And the priest said unto them, Go in peace: before the LORD is
        your way wherein ye go.

018:007 Then the five men departed, and came to Laish, and saw the
        people that were therein, how they dwelt careless, after the
        manner of the Zidonians, quiet and secure; and there was no
        magistrate in the land, that might put them to shame in any
        thing; and they were far from the Zidonians, and had no
        business with any man.

018:008 And they came unto their brethren to Zorah and Eshtaol: and
        their brethren said unto them, What say ye?

018:009 And they said, Arise, that we may go up against them: for we
        have seen the land, and, behold, it is very good: and are ye
        still? be not slothful to go, and to enter to possess the
        land.

018:010 When ye go, ye shall come unto a people secure, and to a large
        land: for God hath given it into your hands; a place where
        there is no want of any thing that is in the earth.

018:011 And there went from thence of the family of the Danites, out
        of Zorah and out of Eshtaol, six hundred men appointed with
        weapons of war.

018:012 And they went up, and pitched in Kirjathjearim, in Judah:
        wherefore they called that place Mahanehdan unto this day:
        behold, it is behind Kirjathjearim.

018:013 And they passed thence unto mount Ephraim, and came unto the
        house of Micah.

018:014 Then answered the five men that went to spy out the country of
        Laish, and said unto their brethren, Do ye know that there is
        in these houses an ephod, and teraphim, and a graven image,
        and a molten image? now therefore consider what ye have to do.

018:015 And they turned thitherward, and came to the house of the
        young man the Levite, even unto the house of Micah, and
        saluted him.

018:016 And the six hundred men appointed with their weapons of war,
        which were of the children of Dan, stood by the entering of
        the gate.

018:017 And the five men that went to spy out the land went up, and
        came in thither, and took the graven image, and the ephod, and
        the teraphim, and the molten image: and the priest stood in
        the entering of the gate with the six hundred men that were
        appointed with weapons of war.

018:018 And these went into Micah's house, and fetched the carved
        image, the ephod, and the teraphim, and the molten image. Then
        said the priest unto them, What do ye?

018:019 And they said unto him, Hold thy peace, lay thine hand upon
        thy mouth, and go with us, and be to us a father and a priest:
        is it better for thee to be a priest unto the house of one
        man, or that thou be a priest unto a tribe and a family in
        Israel?

018:020 And the priest's heart was glad, and he took the ephod, and
        the teraphim, and the graven image, and went in the midst of
        the people.

018:021 So they turned and departed, and put the little ones and the
        cattle and the carriage before them.

018:022 And when they were a good way from the house of Micah, the men
        that were in the houses near to Micah's house were gathered
        together, and overtook the children of Dan.

018:023 And they cried unto the children of Dan. And they turned their
        faces, and said unto Micah, What aileth thee, that thou comest
        with such a company?

018:024 And he said, Ye have taken away my gods which I made, and the
        priest, and ye are gone away: and what have I more? and what
        is this that ye say unto me, What aileth thee?

018:025 And the children of Dan said unto him, Let not thy voice be
        heard among us, lest angry fellows run upon thee, and thou
        lose thy life, with the lives of thy household.

018:026 And the children of Dan went their way: and when Micah saw
        that they were too strong for him, he turned and went back
        unto his house.

018:027 And they took the things which Micah had made, and the priest
        which he had, and came unto Laish, unto a people that were at
        quiet and secure: and they smote them with the edge of the
        sword, and burnt the city with fire.

018:028 And there was no deliverer, because it was far from Zidon, and
        they had no business with any man; and it was in the valley
        that lieth by Bethrehob. And they built a city, and dwelt
        therein.

018:029 And they called the name of the city Dan, after the name of
        Dan their father, who was born unto Israel: howbeit the name
        of the city was Laish at the first.

018:030 And the children of Dan set up the graven image: and Jonathan,
        the son of Gershom, the son of Manasseh, he and his sons were
        priests to the tribe of Dan until the day of the captivity of
        the land.

018:031 And they set them up Micah's graven image, which he made, all
        the time that the house of God was in Shiloh.

019:001 And it came to pass in those days, when there was no king in
        Israel, that there was a certain Levite sojourning on the side
        of mount Ephraim, who took to him a concubine out of
        Bethlehemjudah.

019:002 And his concubine played the whore against him, and went away
        from him unto her father's house to Bethlehemjudah, and was
        there four whole months.

019:003 And her husband arose, and went after her, to speak friendly
        unto her, and to bring her again, having his servant with him,
        and a couple of asses: and she brought him into her father's
        house: and when the father of the damsel saw him, he rejoiced
        to meet him.

019:004 And his father in law, the damsel's father, retained him; and
        he abode with him three days: so they did eat and drink, and
        lodged there.

019:005 And it came to pass on the fourth day, when they arose early
        in the morning, that he rose up to depart: and the damsel's
        father said unto his son in law, Comfort thine heart with a
        morsel of bread, and afterward go your way.

019:006 And they sat down, and did eat and drink both of them
        together: for the damsel's father had said unto the man, Be
        content, I pray thee, and tarry all night, and let thine heart
        be merry.

019:007 And when the man rose up to depart, his father in law urged
        him: therefore he lodged there again.

019:008 And he arose early in the morning on the fifth day to depart;
        and the damsel's father said, Comfort thine heart, I pray
        thee. And they tarried until afternoon, and they did eat both
        of them.

019:009 And when the man rose up to depart, he, and his concubine, and
        his servant, his father in law, the damsel's father, said unto
        him, Behold, now the day draweth toward evening, I pray you
        tarry all night: behold, the day groweth to an end, lodge
        here, that thine heart may be merry; and to morrow get you
        early on your way, that thou mayest go home.

019:010 But the man would not tarry that night, but he rose up and
        departed, and came over against Jebus, which is Jerusalem; and
        there were with him two asses saddled, his concubine also was
        with him.

019:011 And when they were by Jebus, the day was far spent; and the
        servant said unto his master, Come, I pray thee, and let us
        turn in into this city of the Jebusites, and lodge in it.

019:012 And his master said unto him, We will not turn aside hither
        into the city of a stranger, that is not of the children of
        Israel; we will pass over to Gibeah.

019:013 And he said unto his servant, Come, and let us draw near to
        one of these places to lodge all night, in Gibeah, or in
        Ramah.

019:014 And they passed on and went their way; and the sun went down
        upon them when they were by Gibeah, which belongeth to
        Benjamin.

019:015 And they turned aside thither, to go in and to lodge in
        Gibeah: and when he went in, he sat him down in a street of
        the city: for there was no man that took them into his house
        to lodging.

019:016 And, behold, there came an old man from his work out of the
        field at even, which was also of mount Ephraim; and he
        sojourned in Gibeah: but the men of the place were Benjamites.

019:017 And when he had lifted up his eyes, he saw a wayfaring man in
        the street of the city: and the old man said, Whither goest
        thou? and whence comest thou?

019:018 And he said unto him, We are passing from Bethlehemjudah
        toward the side of mount Ephraim; from thence am I: and I went
        to Bethlehemjudah, but I am now going to the house of the
        LORD; and there is no man that receiveth me to house.

019:019 Yet there is both straw and provender for our asses; and there
        is bread and wine also for me, and for thy handmaid, and for
        the young man which is with thy servants: there is no want of
        any thing.

019:020 And the old man said, Peace be with thee; howsoever let all
        thy wants lie upon me; only lodge not in the street.

019:021 So he brought him into his house, and gave provender unto the
        asses: and they washed their feet, and did eat and drink.

019:022 Now as they were making their hearts merry, behold, the men of
        the city, certain sons of Belial, beset the house round about,
        and beat at the door, and spake to the master of the house,
        the old man, saying, Bring forth the man that came into thine
        house, that we may know him.

019:023 And the man, the master of the house, went out unto them, and
        said unto them, Nay, my brethren, nay, I pray you, do not so
        wickedly; seeing that this man is come into mine house, do not
        this folly.

019:024 Behold, here is my daughter a maiden, and his concubine; them
        I will bring out now, and humble ye them, and do with them
        what seemeth good unto you: but unto this man do not so vile a
        thing.

019:025 But the men would not hearken to him: so the man took his
        concubine, and brought her forth unto them; and they knew her,
        and abused her all the night until the morning: and when the
        day began to spring, they let her go.

019:026 Then came the woman in the dawning of the day, and fell down
        at the door of the man's house where her lord was, till it was
        light.

019:027 And her lord rose up in the morning, and opened the doors of
        the house, and went out to go his way: and, behold, the woman
        his concubine was fallen down at the door of the house, and
        her hands were upon the threshold.

019:028 And he said unto her, Up, and let us be going. But none
        answered. Then the man took her up upon an ass, and the man
        rose up, and gat him unto his place.

019:029 And when he was come into his house, he took a knife, and laid
        hold on his concubine, and divided her, together with her
        bones, into twelve pieces, and sent her into all the coasts of
        Israel.

019:030 And it was so, that all that saw it said, There was no such
        deed done nor seen from the day that the children of Israel
        came up out of the land of Egypt unto this day: consider of
        it, take advice, and speak your minds.

020:001 Then all the children of Israel went out, and the congregation
        was gathered together as one man, from Dan even to Beersheba,
        with the land of Gilead, unto the LORD in Mizpeh.

020:002 And the chief of all the people, even of all the tribes of
        Israel, presented themselves in the assembly of the people of
        God, four hundred thousand footmen that drew sword.

020:003 (Now the children of Benjamin heard that the children of
        Israel were gone up to Mizpeh.) Then said the children of
        Israel, Tell us, how was this wickedness?

020:004 And the Levite, the husband of the woman that was slain,
        answered and said, I came into Gibeah that belongeth to
        Benjamin, I and my concubine, to lodge.

020:005 And the men of Gibeah rose against me, and beset the house
        round about upon me by night, and thought to have slain me:
        and my concubine have they forced, that she is dead.

020:006 And I took my concubine, and cut her in pieces, and sent her
        throughout all the country of the inheritance of Israel: for
        they have committed lewdness and folly in Israel.

020:007 Behold, ye are all children of Israel; give here your advice
        and counsel.

020:008 And all the people arose as one man, saying, We will not any
        of us go to his tent, neither will we any of us turn into his
        house.

020:009 But now this shall be the thing which we will do to Gibeah; we
        will go up by lot against it;

020:010 And we will take ten men of an hundred throughout all the
        tribes of Israel, and an hundred of a thousand, and a thousand
        out of ten thousand, to fetch victual for the people, that
        they may do, when they come to Gibeah of Benjamin, according
        to all the folly that they have wrought in Israel.

020:011 So all the men of Israel were gathered against the city, knit
        together as one man.

020:012 And the tribes of Israel sent men through all the tribe of
        Benjamin, saying, What wickedness is this that is done among
        you?

020:013 Now therefore deliver us the men, the children of Belial,
        which are in Gibeah, that we may put them to death, and put
        away evil from Israel. But the children of Benjamin would not
        hearken to the voice of their brethren the children of Israel.

020:014 But the children of Benjamin gathered themselves together out
        of the cities unto Gibeah, to go out to battle against the
        children of Israel.

020:015 And the children of Benjamin were numbered at that time out of
        the cities twenty and six thousand men that drew sword, beside
        the inhabitants of Gibeah, which were numbered seven hundred
        chosen men.

020:016 Among all this people there were seven hundred chosen men
        lefthanded; every one could sling stones at an hair breadth,
        and not miss.

020:017 And the men of Israel, beside Benjamin, were numbered four
        hundred thousand men that drew sword: all these were men of
        war.

020:018 And the children of Israel arose, and went up to the house of
        God, and asked counsel of God, and said, Which of us shall go
        up first to the battle against the children of Benjamin? And
        the LORD said, Judah shall go up first.

020:019 And the children of Israel rose up in the morning, and
        encamped against Gibeah.

020:020 And the men of Israel went out to battle against Benjamin; and
        the men of Israel put themselves in array to fight against
        them at Gibeah.

020:021 And the children of Benjamin came forth out of Gibeah, and
        destroyed down to the ground of the Israelites that day twenty
        and two thousand men.

020:022 And the people the men of Israel encouraged themselves, and
        set their battle again in array in the place where they put
        themselves in array the first day.

020:023 (And the children of Israel went up and wept before the LORD
        until even, and asked counsel of the LORD, saying, Shall I go
        up again to battle against the children of Benjamin my
        brother? And the LORD said, Go up against him.)

020:024 And the children of Israel came near against the children of
        Benjamin the second day.

020:025 And Benjamin went forth against them out of Gibeah the second
        day, and destroyed down to the ground of the children of
        Israel again eighteen thousand men; all these drew the sword.

020:026 Then all the children of Israel, and all the people, went up,
        and came unto the house of God, and wept, and sat there before
        the LORD, and fasted that day until even, and offered burnt
        offerings and peace offerings before the LORD.

020:027 And the children of Israel enquired of the LORD, (for the ark
        of the covenant of God was there in those days,

020:028 And Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, stood
        before it in those days,) saying, Shall I yet again go out to
        battle against the children of Benjamin my brother, or shall I
        cease? And the LORD said, Go up; for to morrow I will deliver
        them into thine hand.

020:029 And Israel set liers in wait round about Gibeah.

020:030 And the children of Israel went up against the children of
        Benjamin on the third day, and put themselves in array against
        Gibeah, as at other times.

020:031 And the children of Benjamin went out against the people, and
        were drawn away from the city; and they began to smite of the
        people, and kill, as at other times, in the highways, of which
        one goeth up to the house of God, and the other to Gibeah in
        the field, about thirty men of Israel.

020:032 And the children of Benjamin said, They are smitten down
        before us, as at the first. But the children of Israel said,
        Let us flee, and draw them from the city unto the highways.

020:033 And all the men of Israel rose up out of their place, and put
        themselves in array at Baaltamar: and the liers in wait of
        Israel came forth out of their places, even out of the meadows
        of Gibeah.

020:034 And there came against Gibeah ten thousand chosen men out of
        all Israel, and the battle was sore: but they knew not that
        evil was near them.

020:035 And the LORD smote Benjamin before Israel: and the children of
        Israel destroyed of the Benjamites that day twenty and five
        thousand and an hundred men: all these drew the sword.

020:036 So the children of Benjamin saw that they were smitten: for
        the men of Israel gave place to the Benjamites, because they
        trusted unto the liers in wait which they had set beside
        Gibeah.

020:037 And the liers in wait hasted, and rushed upon Gibeah; and the
        liers in wait drew themselves along, and smote all the city
        with the edge of the sword.

020:038 Now there was an appointed sign between the men of Israel and
        the liers in wait, that they should make a great flame with
        smoke rise up out of the city.

020:039 And when the men of Israel retired in the battle, Benjamin
        began to smite and kill of the men of Israel about thirty
        persons: for they said, Surely they are smitten down before
        us, as in the first battle.

020:040 But when the flame began to arise up out of the city with a
        pillar of smoke, the Benjamites looked behind them, and,
        behold, the flame of the city ascended up to heaven.

020:041 And when the men of Israel turned again, the men of Benjamin
        were amazed: for they saw that evil was come upon them.

020:042 Therefore they turned their backs before the men of Israel
        unto the way of the wilderness; but the battle overtook them;
        and them which came out of the cities they destroyed in the
        midst of them.

020:043 Thus they inclosed the Benjamites round about, and chased
        them, and trode them down with ease over against Gibeah toward
        the sunrising.

020:044 And there fell of Benjamin eighteen thousand men; all these
        were men of valour.

020:045 And they turned and fled toward the wilderness unto the rock
        of Rimmon: and they gleaned of them in the highways five
        thousand men; and pursued hard after them unto Gidom, and slew
        two thousand men of them.

020:046 So that all which fell that day of Benjamin were twenty and
        five thousand men that drew the sword; all these were men of
        valour.

020:047 But six hundred men turned and fled to the wilderness unto the
        rock Rimmon, and abode in the rock Rimmon four months.

020:048 And the men of Israel turned again upon the children of
        Benjamin, and smote them with the edge of the sword, as well
        the men of every city, as the beast, and all that came to
        hand: also they set on fire all the cities that they came to.

021:001 Now the men of Israel had sworn in Mizpeh, saying, There shall
        not any of us give his daughter unto Benjamin to wife.

021:002 And the people came to the house of God, and abode there till
        even before God, and lifted up their voices, and wept sore;

021:003 And said, O LORD God of Israel, why is this come to pass in
        Israel, that there should be to day one tribe lacking in
        Israel?

021:004 And it came to pass on the morrow, that the people rose early,
        and built there an altar, and offered burnt offerings and
        peace offerings.

021:005 And the children of Israel said, Who is there among all the
        tribes of Israel that came not up with the congregation unto
        the LORD? For they had made a great oath concerning him that
        came not up to the LORD to Mizpeh, saying, He shall surely be
        put to death.

021:006 And the children of Israel repented them for Benjamin their
        brother, and said, There is one tribe cut off from Israel this
        day.

021:007 How shall we do for wives for them that remain, seeing we have
        sworn by the LORD that we will not give them of our daughters
        to wives?

021:008 And they said, What one is there of the tribes of Israel that
        came not up to Mizpeh to the LORD? And, behold, there came
        none to the camp from Jabeshgilead to the assembly.

021:009 For the people were numbered, and, behold, there were none of
        the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead there.

021:010 And the congregation sent thither twelve thousand men of the
        valiantest, and commanded them, saying, Go and smite the
        inhabitants of Jabeshgilead with the edge of the sword, with
        the women and the children.

021:011 And this is the thing that ye shall do, Ye shall utterly
        destroy every male, and every woman that hath lain by man.

021:012 And they found among the inhabitants of Jabeshgilead four
        hundred young virgins, that had known no man by lying with any
        male: and they brought them unto the camp to Shiloh, which is
        in the land of Canaan.

021:013 And the whole congregation sent some to speak to the children
        of Benjamin that were in the rock Rimmon, and to call
        peaceably unto them.

021:014 And Benjamin came again at that time; and they gave them wives
        which they had saved alive of the women of Jabeshgilead: and
        yet so they sufficed them not.

021:015 And the people repented them for Benjamin, because that the
        LORD had made a breach in the tribes of Israel.

021:016 Then the elders of the congregation said, How shall we do for
        wives for them that remain, seeing the women are destroyed out
        of Benjamin?

021:017 And they said, There must be an inheritance for them that be
        escaped of Benjamin, that a tribe be not destroyed out of
        Israel.

021:018 Howbeit we may not give them wives of our daughters: for the
        children of Israel have sworn, saying, Cursed be he that
        giveth a wife to Benjamin.

021:019 Then they said, Behold, there is a feast of the LORD in Shiloh
        yearly in a place which is on the north side of Bethel, on the
        east side of the highway that goeth up from Bethel to Shechem,
        and on the south of Lebonah.

021:020 Therefore they commanded the children of Benjamin, saying, Go
        and lie in wait in the vineyards;

021:021 And see, and, behold, if the daughters of Shiloh come out to
        dance in dances, then come ye out of the vineyards, and catch
        you every man his wife of the daughters of Shiloh, and go to
        the land of Benjamin.

021:022 And it shall be, when their fathers or their brethren come
        unto us to complain, that we will say unto them, Be favourable
        unto them for our sakes: because we reserved not to each man
        his wife in the war: for ye did not give unto them at this
        time, that ye should be guilty.

021:023 And the children of Benjamin did so, and took them wives,
        according to their number, of them that danced, whom they
        caught: and they went and returned unto their inheritance, and
        repaired the cities, and dwelt in them.

021:024 And the children of Israel departed thence at that time, every
        man to his tribe and to his family, and they went out from
        thence every man to his inheritance.

021:025 In those days there was no king in Israel: every man did that
        which was right in his own eyes.

Book 08	Ruth

001:001 Now it came to pass in the days when the judges ruled, that
        there was a famine in the land. And a certain man of
        Bethlehemjudah went to sojourn in the country of Moab, he, and
        his wife, and his two sons.

001:002 And the name of the man was Elimelech, and the name of his
        wife Naomi, and the name of his two sons Mahlon and Chilion,
        Ephrathites of Bethlehemjudah. And they came into the country
        of Moab, and continued there.

001:003 And Elimelech Naomi's husband died; and she was left, and her
        two sons.

001:004 And they took them wives of the women of Moab; the name of the
        one was Orpah, and the name of the other Ruth: and they
        dwelled there about ten years.

001:005 And Mahlon and Chilion died also both of them; and the woman
        was left of her two sons and her husband.

001:006 Then she arose with her daughters in law, that she might
        return from the country of Moab: for she had heard in the
        country of Moab how that the LORD had visited his people in
        giving them bread.

001:007 Wherefore she went forth out of the place where she was, and
        her two daughters in law with her; and they went on the way to
        return unto the land of Judah.

001:008 And Naomi said unto her two daughters in law, Go, return each
        to her mother's house: the LORD deal kindly with you, as ye
        have dealt with the dead, and with me.

001:009 The LORD grant you that ye may find rest, each of you in the
        house of her husband. Then she kissed them; and they lifted up
        their voice, and wept.

001:010 And they said unto her, Surely we will return with thee unto
        thy people.

001:011 And Naomi said, Turn again, my daughters: why will ye go with
        me? are there yet any more sons in my womb, that they may be
        your husbands?

001:012 Turn again, my daughters, go your way; for I am too old to
        have an husband. If I should say, I have hope, if I should
        have an husband also to night, and should also bear sons;

001:013 Would ye tarry for them till they were grown? would ye stay
        for them from having husbands? nay, my daughters; for it
        grieveth me much for your sakes that the hand of the LORD is
        gone out against me.

001:014 And they lifted up their voice, and wept again: and Orpah
        kissed her mother in law; but Ruth clave unto her.

001:015 And she said, Behold, thy sister in law is gone back unto her
        people, and unto her gods: return thou after thy sister in
        law.

001:016 And Ruth said, Intreat me not to leave thee, or to return from
        following after thee: for whither thou goest, I will go; and
        where thou lodgest, I will lodge: thy people shall be my
        people, and thy God my God:

001:017 Where thou diest, will I die, and there will I be buried: the
        LORD do so to me, and more also, if ought but death part thee
        and me.

001:018 When she saw that she was stedfastly minded to go with her,
        then she left speaking unto her.

001:019 So they two went until they came to Bethlehem. And it came to
        pass, when they were come to Bethlehem, that all the city was
        moved about them, and they said, Is this Naomi?

001:020 And she said unto them, Call me not Naomi, call me Mara: for
        the Almighty hath dealt very bitterly with me.

001:021 I went out full and the LORD hath brought me home again empty:
        why then call ye me Naomi, seeing the LORD hath testified
        against me, and the Almighty hath afflicted me?

001:022 So Naomi returned, and Ruth the Moabitess, her daughter in
        law, with her, which returned out of the country of Moab: and
        they came to Bethlehem in the beginning of barley harvest.

002:001 And Naomi had a kinsman of her husband's, a mighty man of
        wealth, of the family of Elimelech; and his name was Boaz.

002:002 And Ruth the Moabitess said unto Naomi, Let me now go to the
        field, and glean ears of corn after him in whose sight I shall
        find grace. And she said unto her, Go, my daughter.

002:003 And she went, and came, and gleaned in the field after the
        reapers: and her hap was to light on a part of the field
        belonging unto Boaz, who was of the kindred of Elimelech.

002:004 And, behold, Boaz came from Bethlehem, and said unto the
        reapers, The LORD be with you. And they answered him, The LORD
        bless thee.

002:005 Then said Boaz unto his servant that was set over the reapers,
        Whose damsel is this?

002:006 And the servant that was set over the reapers answered and
        said, It is the Moabitish damsel that came back with Naomi out
        of the country of Moab:

002:007 And she said, I pray you, let me glean and gather after the
        reapers among the sheaves: so she came, and hath continued
        even from the morning until now, that she tarried a little in
        the house.

002:008 Then said Boaz unto Ruth, Hearest thou not, my daughter? Go
        not to glean in another field, neither go from hence, but
        abide here fast by my maidens:

002:009 Let thine eyes be on the field that they do reap, and go thou
        after them: have I not charged the young men that they shall
        not touch thee? and when thou art athirst, go unto the
        vessels, and drink of that which the young men have drawn.

002:010 Then she fell on her face, and bowed herself to the ground,
        and said unto him, Why have I found grace in thine eyes, that
        thou shouldest take knowledge of me, seeing I am a stranger?

002:011 And Boaz answered and said unto her, It hath fully been shewed
        me, all that thou hast done unto thy mother in law since the
        death of thine husband: and how thou hast left thy father and
        thy mother, and the land of thy nativity, and art come unto a
        people which thou knewest not heretofore.

002:012 The LORD recompense thy work, and a full reward be given thee
        of the LORD God of Israel, under whose wings thou art come to
        trust.

002:013 Then she said, Let me find favour in thy sight, my lord; for
        that thou hast comforted me, and for that thou hast spoken
        friendly unto thine handmaid, though I be not like unto one of
        thine handmaidens.

002:014 And Boaz said unto her, At mealtime come thou hither, and eat
        of the bread, and dip thy morsel in the vinegar. And she sat
        beside the reapers: and he reached her parched corn, and she
        did eat, and was sufficed, and left.

002:015 And when she was risen up to glean, Boaz commanded his young
        men, saying, Let her glean even among the sheaves, and
        reproach her not:

002:016 And let fall also some of the handfuls of purpose for her, and
        leave them, that she may glean them, and rebuke her not.

002:017 So she gleaned in the field until even, and beat out that she
        had gleaned: and it was about an ephah of barley.

002:018 And she took it up, and went into the city: and her mother in
        law saw what she had gleaned: and she brought forth, and gave
        to her that she had reserved after she was sufficed.

002:019 And her mother in law said unto her, Where hast thou gleaned
        to day? and where wroughtest thou? blessed be he that did take
        knowledge of thee. And she shewed her mother in law with whom
        she had wrought, and said, The man's name with whom I wrought
        to day is Boaz.

002:020 And Naomi said unto her daughter in law, Blessed be he of the
        LORD, who hath not left off his kindness to the living and to
        the dead. And Naomi said unto her, The man is near of kin unto
        us, one of our next kinsmen.

002:021 And Ruth the Moabitess said, He said unto me also, Thou shalt
        keep fast by my young men, until they have ended all my
        harvest.

002:022 And Naomi said unto Ruth her daughter in law, It is good, my
        daughter, that thou go out with his maidens, that they meet
        thee not in any other field.

002:023 So she kept fast by the maidens of Boaz to glean unto the end
        of barley harvest and of wheat harvest; and dwelt with her
        mother in law.

003:001 Then Naomi her mother in law said unto her, My daughter, shall
        I not seek rest for thee, that it may be well with thee?

003:002 And now is not Boaz of our kindred, with whose maidens thou
        wast? Behold, he winnoweth barley to night in the
        threshingfloor.

003:003 Wash thyself therefore, and anoint thee, and put thy raiment
        upon thee, and get thee down to the floor: but make not
        thyself known unto the man, until he shall have done eating
        and drinking.

003:004 And it shall be, when he lieth down, that thou shalt mark the
        place where he shall lie, and thou shalt go in, and uncover
        his feet, and lay thee down; and he will tell thee what thou
        shalt do.

003:005 And she said unto her, All that thou sayest unto me I will do.

003:006 And she went down unto the floor, and did according to all
        that her mother in law bade her.

003:007 And when Boaz had eaten and drunk, and his heart was merry, he
        went to lie down at the end of the heap of corn: and she came
        softly, and uncovered his feet, and laid her down.

003:008 And it came to pass at midnight, that the man was afraid, and
        turned himself: and, behold, a woman lay at his feet.

003:009 And he said, Who art thou? And she answered, I am Ruth thine
        handmaid: spread therefore thy skirt over thine handmaid; for
        thou art a near kinsman.

003:010 And he said, Blessed be thou of the LORD, my daughter: for
        thou hast shewed more kindness in the latter end than at the
        beginning, inasmuch as thou followedst not young men, whether
        poor or rich.

003:011 And now, my daughter, fear not; I will do to thee all that
        thou requirest: for all the city of my people doth know that
        thou art a virtuous woman.

003:012 And now it is true that I am thy near kinsman: howbeit there
        is a kinsman nearer than I.

003:013 Tarry this night, and it shall be in the morning, that if he
        will perform unto thee the part of a kinsman, well; let him do
        the kinsman's part: but if he will not do the part of a
        kinsman to thee, then will I do the part of a kinsman to thee,
        as the LORD liveth: lie down until the morning.

003:014 And she lay at his feet until the morning: and she rose up
        before one could know another. And he said, Let it not be
        known that a woman came into the floor.

003:015 Also he said, Bring the vail that thou hast upon thee, and
        hold it. And when she held it, he measured six measures of
        barley, and laid it on her: and she went into the city.

003:016 And when she came to her mother in law, she said, Who art
        thou, my daughter? And she told her all that the man had done
        to her.

003:017 And she said, These six measures of barley gave he me; for he
        said to me, Go not empty unto thy mother in law.

003:018 Then said she, Sit still, my daughter, until thou know how the
        matter will fall: for the man will not be in rest, until he
        have finished the thing this day.

004:001 Then went Boaz up to the gate, and sat him down there: and,
        behold, the kinsman of whom Boaz spake came by; unto whom he
        said, Ho, such a one! turn aside, sit down here. And he turned
        aside, and sat down.

004:002 And he took ten men of the elders of the city, and said, Sit
        ye down here. And they sat down.

004:003 And he said unto the kinsman, Naomi, that is come again out of
        the country of Moab, selleth a parcel of land, which was our
        brother Elimelech's:

004:004 And I thought to advertise thee, saying, Buy it before the
        inhabitants, and before the elders of my people. If thou wilt
        redeem it, redeem it: but if thou wilt not redeem it, then
        tell me, that I may know: for there is none to redeem it
        beside thee; and I am after thee. And he said, I will redeem
        it.

004:005 Then said Boaz, What day thou buyest the field of the hand of
        Naomi, thou must buy it also of Ruth the Moabitess, the wife
        of the dead, to raise up the name of the dead upon his
        inheritance.

004:006 And the kinsman said, I cannot redeem it for myself, lest I
        mar mine own inheritance: redeem thou my right to thyself; for
        I cannot redeem it.

004:007 Now this was the manner in former time in Israel concerning
        redeeming and concerning changing, for to confirm all things;
        a man plucked off his shoe, and gave it to his neighbour: and
        this was a testimony in Israel.

004:008 Therefore the kinsman said unto Boaz, Buy it for thee. So he
        drew off his shoe.

004:009 And Boaz said unto the elders, and unto all the people, Ye are
        witnesses this day, that I have bought all that was
        Elimelech's, and all that was Chilion's and Mahlon's, of the
        hand of Naomi.

004:010 Moreover Ruth the Moabitess, the wife of Mahlon, have I
        purchased to be my wife, to raise up the name of the dead upon
        his inheritance, that the name of the dead be not cut off from
        among his brethren, and from the gate of his place: ye are
        witnesses this day.

004:011 And all the people that were in the gate, and the elders,
        said, We are witnesses. The LORD make the woman that is come
        into thine house like Rachel and like Leah, which two did
        build the house of Israel: and do thou worthily in Ephratah,
        and be famous in Bethlehem:

004:012 And let thy house be like the house of Pharez, whom Tamar bare
        unto Judah, of the seed which the LORD shall give thee of this
        young woman.

004:013 So Boaz took Ruth, and she was his wife: and when he went in
        unto her, the LORD gave her conception, and she bare a son.

004:014 And the women said unto Naomi, Blessed be the LORD, which hath
        not left thee this day without a kinsman, that his name may be
        famous in Israel.

004:015 And he shall be unto thee a restorer of thy life, and a
        nourisher of thine old age: for thy daughter in law, which
        loveth thee, which is better to thee than seven sons, hath
        born him.

004:016 And Naomi took the child, and laid it in her bosom, and became
        nurse unto it.

004:017 And the women her neighbours gave it a name, saying, There is
        a son born to Naomi; and they called his name Obed: he is the
        father of Jesse, the father of David.

004:018 Now these are the generations of Pharez: Pharez begat Hezron,

004:019 And Hezron begat Ram, and Ram begat Amminadab,

004:020 And Amminadab begat Nahshon, and Nahshon begat Salmon,

004:021 And Salmon begat Boaz, and Boaz begat Obed,

004:022 And Obed begat Jesse, and Jesse begat David.

Book 09	1 Samuel

001:001 Now there was a certain man of Ramathaimzophim, of mount
        Ephraim, and his name was Elkanah, the son of Jeroham, the son
        of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephrathite:

001:002 And he had two wives; the name of the one was Hannah, and the
        name of the other Peninnah: and Peninnah had children, but
        Hannah had no children.

001:003 And this man went up out of his city yearly to worship and to
        sacrifice unto the LORD of hosts in Shiloh. And the two sons
        of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, the priests of the LORD, were
        there.

001:004 And when the time was that Elkanah offered, he gave to
        Peninnah his wife, and to all her sons and her daughters,
        portions:

001:005 But unto Hannah he gave a worthy portion; for he loved Hannah:
        but the LORD had shut up her womb.

001:006 And her adversary also provoked her sore, for to make her
        fret, because the LORD had shut up her womb.

001:007 And as he did so year by year, when she went up to the house
        of the LORD, so she provoked her; therefore she wept, and did
        not eat.

001:008 Then said Elkanah her husband to her, Hannah, why weepest
        thou? and why eatest thou not? and why is thy heart grieved?
        am not I better to thee than ten sons?

001:009 So Hannah rose up after they had eaten in Shiloh, and after
        they had drunk. Now Eli the priest sat upon a seat by a post
        of the temple of the LORD.

001:010 And she was in bitterness of soul, and prayed unto the LORD,
        and wept sore.

001:011 And she vowed a vow, and said, O LORD of hosts, if thou wilt
        indeed look on the affliction of thine handmaid, and remember
        me, and not forget thine handmaid, but wilt give unto thine
        handmaid a man child, then I will give him unto the LORD all
        the days of his life, and there shall no razor come upon his
        head.

001:012 And it came to pass, as she continued praying before the LORD,
        that Eli marked her mouth.

001:013 Now Hannah, she spake in her heart; only her lips moved, but
        her voice was not heard: therefore Eli thought she had been
        drunken.

001:014 And Eli said unto her, How long wilt thou be drunken? put away
        thy wine from thee.

001:015 And Hannah answered and said, No, my lord, I am a woman of a
        sorrowful spirit: I have drunk neither wine nor strong drink,
        but have poured out my soul before the LORD.

001:016 Count not thine handmaid for a daughter of Belial: for out of
        the abundance of my complaint and grief have I spoken
        hitherto.

001:017 Then Eli answered and said, Go in peace: and the God of Israel
        grant thee thy petition that thou hast asked of him.

001:018 And she said, Let thine handmaid find grace in thy sight. So
        the woman went her way, and did eat, and her countenance was
        no more sad.

001:019 And they rose up in the morning early, and worshipped before
        the LORD, and returned, and came to their house to Ramah: and
        Elkanah knew Hannah his wife; and the LORD remembered her.

001:020 Wherefore it came to pass, when the time was come about after
        Hannah had conceived, that she bare a son, and called his name
        Samuel, saying, Because I have asked him of the LORD.

001:021 And the man Elkanah, and all his house, went up to offer unto
        the LORD the yearly sacrifice, and his vow.

001:022 But Hannah went not up; for she said unto her husband, I will
        not go up until the child be weaned, and then I will bring
        him, that he may appear before the LORD, and there abide for
        ever.

001:023 And Elkanah her husband said unto her, Do what seemeth thee
        good; tarry until thou have weaned him; only the LORD
        establish his word. So the woman abode, and gave her son suck
        until she weaned him.

001:024 And when she had weaned him, she took him up with her, with
        three bullocks, and one ephah of flour, and a bottle of wine,
        and brought him unto the house of the LORD in Shiloh: and the
        child was young.

001:025 And they slew a bullock, and brought the child to Eli.

001:026 And she said, Oh my lord, as thy soul liveth, my lord, I am
        the woman that stood by thee here, praying unto the LORD.

001:027 For this child I prayed; and the LORD hath given me my
        petition which I asked of him:

001:028 Therefore also I have lent him to the LORD; as long as he
        liveth he shall be lent to the LORD. And he worshipped the
        LORD there.

002:001 And Hannah prayed, and said, My heart rejoiceth in the LORD,
        mine horn is exalted in the LORD: my mouth is enlarged over
        mine enemies; because I rejoice in thy salvation.

002:002 There is none holy as the LORD: for there is none beside thee:
        neither is there any rock like our God.

002:003 Talk no more so exceeding proudly; let not arrogancy come out
        of your mouth: for the LORD is a God of knowledge, and by him
        actions are weighed.

002:004 The bows of the mighty men are broken, and they that stumbled
        are girded with strength.

002:005 They that were full have hired out themselves for bread; and
        they that were hungry ceased: so that the barren hath born
        seven; and she that hath many children is waxed feeble.

002:006 The LORD killeth, and maketh alive: he bringeth down to the
        grave, and bringeth up.

002:007 The LORD maketh poor, and maketh rich: he bringeth low, and
        lifteth up.

002:008 He raiseth up the poor out of the dust, and lifteth up the
        beggar from the dunghill, to set them among princes, and to
        make them inherit the throne of glory: for the pillars of the
        earth are the LORD's, and he hath set the world upon them.

002:009 He will keep the feet of his saints, and the wicked shall be
        silent in darkness; for by strength shall no man prevail.

002:010 The adversaries of the LORD shall be broken to pieces; out of
        heaven shall he thunder upon them: the LORD shall judge the
        ends of the earth; and he shall give strength unto his king,
        and exalt the horn of his anointed.

002:011 And Elkanah went to Ramah to his house. And the child did
        minister unto the LORD before Eli the priest.

002:012 Now the sons of Eli were sons of Belial; they knew not the
        LORD.

002:013 And the priest's custom with the people was, that, when any
        man offered sacrifice, the priest's servant came, while the
        flesh was in seething, with a fleshhook of three teeth in his
        hand;

002:014 And he struck it into the pan, or kettle, or caldron, or pot;
        all that the fleshhook brought up the priest took for himself.
        So they did in Shiloh unto all the Israelites that came
        thither.

002:015 Also before they burnt the fat, the priest's servant came, and
        said to the man that sacrificed, Give flesh to roast for the
        priest; for he will not have sodden flesh of thee, but raw.

002:016 And if any man said unto him, Let them not fail to burn the
        fat presently, and then take as much as thy soul desireth;
        then he would answer him, Nay; but thou shalt give it me now:
        and if not, I will take it by force.

002:017 Wherefore the sin of the young men was very great before the
        LORD: for men abhorred the offering of the LORD.

002:018 But Samuel ministered before the LORD, being a child, girded
        with a linen ephod.

002:019 Moreover his mother made him a little coat, and brought it to
        him from year to year, when she came up with her husband to
        offer the yearly sacrifice.

002:020 And Eli blessed Elkanah and his wife, and said, The LORD give
        thee seed of this woman for the loan which is lent to the
        LORD. And they went unto their own home.

002:021 And the LORD visited Hannah, so that she conceived, and bare
        three sons and two daughters. And the child Samuel grew before
        the LORD.

002:022 Now Eli was very old, and heard all that his sons did unto all
        Israel; and how they lay with the women that assembled at the
        door of the tabernacle of the congregation.

002:023 And he said unto them, Why do ye such things? for I hear of
        your evil dealings by all this people.

002:024 Nay, my sons; for it is no good report that I hear: ye make
        the LORD's people to transgress.

002:025 If one man sin against another, the judge shall judge him: but
        if a man sin against the LORD, who shall intreat for him?
        Notwithstanding they hearkened not unto the voice of their
        father, because the LORD would slay them.

002:026 And the child Samuel grew on, and was in favour both with the
        LORD, and also with men.

002:027 And there came a man of God unto Eli, and said unto him, Thus
        saith the LORD, Did I plainly appear unto the house of thy
        father, when they were in Egypt in Pharaoh's house?

002:028 And did I choose him out of all the tribes of Israel to be my
        priest, to offer upon mine altar, to burn incense, to wear an
        ephod before me? and did I give unto the house of thy father
        all the offerings made by fire of the children of Israel?

002:029 Wherefore kick ye at my sacrifice and at mine offering, which
        I have commanded in my habitation; and honourest thy sons
        above me, to make yourselves fat with the chiefest of all the
        offerings of Israel my people?

002:030 Wherefore the LORD God of Israel saith, I said indeed that thy
        house, and the house of thy father, should walk before me for
        ever: but now the LORD saith, Be it far from me; for them that
        honour me I will honour, and they that despise me shall be
        lightly esteemed.

002:031 Behold, the days come, that I will cut off thine arm, and the
        arm of thy father's house, that there shall not be an old man
        in thine house.

002:032 And thou shalt see an enemy in my habitation, in all the
        wealth which God shall give Israel: and there shall not be an
        old man in thine house for ever.

002:033 And the man of thine, whom I shall not cut off from mine
        altar, shall be to consume thine eyes, and to grieve thine
        heart: and all the increase of thine house shall die in the
        flower of their age.

002:034 And this shall be a sign unto thee, that shall come upon thy
        two sons, on Hophni and Phinehas; in one day they shall die
        both of them.

002:035 And I will raise me up a faithful priest, that shall do
        according to that which is in mine heart and in my mind: and I
        will build him a sure house; and he shall walk before mine
        anointed for ever.

002:036 And it shall come to pass, that every one that is left in
        thine house shall come and crouch to him for a piece of silver
        and a morsel of bread, and shall say, Put me, I pray thee,
        into one of the priests' offices, that I may eat a piece of
        bread.

003:001 And the child Samuel ministered unto the LORD before Eli. And
        the word of the LORD was precious in those days; there was no
        open vision.

003:002 And it came to pass at that time, when Eli was laid down in
        his place, and his eyes began to wax dim, that he could not
        see;

003:003 And ere the lamp of God went out in the temple of the LORD,
        where the ark of God was, and Samuel was laid down to sleep;

003:004 That the LORD called Samuel: and he answered, Here am I.

003:005 And he ran unto Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou calledst
        me. And he said, I called not; lie down again. And he went and
        lay down.

003:006 And the LORD called yet again, Samuel. And Samuel arose and
        went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou didst call me. And
        he answered, I called not, my son; lie down again.

003:007 Now Samuel did not yet know the LORD, neither was the word of
        the LORD yet revealed unto him.

003:008 And the LORD called Samuel again the third time. And he arose
        and went to Eli, and said, Here am I; for thou didst call me.
        And Eli perceived that the LORD had called the child.

003:009 Therefore Eli said unto Samuel, Go, lie down: and it shall be,
        if he call thee, that thou shalt say, Speak, LORD; for thy
        servant heareth. So Samuel went and lay down in his place.

003:010 And the LORD came, and stood, and called as at other times,
        Samuel, Samuel. Then Samuel answered, Speak; for thy servant
        heareth.

003:011 And the LORD said to Samuel, Behold, I will do a thing in
        Israel, at which both the ears of every one that heareth it
        shall tingle.

003:012 In that day I will perform against Eli all things which I have
        spoken concerning his house: when I begin, I will also make an
        end.

003:013 For I have told him that I will judge his house for ever for
        the iniquity which he knoweth; because his sons made
        themselves vile, and he restrained them not.

003:014 And therefore I have sworn unto the house of Eli, that the
        iniquity of Eli's house shall not be purged with sacrifice nor
        offering for ever.

003:015 And Samuel lay until the morning, and opened the doors of the
        house of the LORD. And Samuel feared to shew Eli the vision.

003:016 Then Eli called Samuel, and said, Samuel, my son. And he
        answered, Here am I.

003:017 And he said, What is the thing that the LORD hath said unto
        thee? I pray thee hide it not from me: God do so to thee, and
        more also, if thou hide any thing from me of all the things
        that he said unto thee.

003:018 And Samuel told him every whit, and hid nothing from him. And
        he said, It is the LORD: let him do what seemeth him good.

003:019 And Samuel grew, and the LORD was with him, and did let none
        of his words fall to the ground.

003:020 And all Israel from Dan even to Beersheba knew that Samuel was
        established to be a prophet of the LORD.

003:021 And the LORD appeared again in Shiloh: for the LORD revealed
        himself to Samuel in Shiloh by the word of the LORD.

004:001 And the word of Samuel came to all Israel. Now Israel went out
        against the Philistines to battle, and pitched beside
        Ebenezer: and the Philistines pitched in Aphek.

004:002 And the Philistines put themselves in array against Israel:
        and when they joined battle, Israel was smitten before the
        Philistines: and they slew of the army in the field about four
        thousand men.

004:003 And when the people were come into the camp, the elders of
        Israel said, Wherefore hath the LORD smitten us to day before
        the Philistines? Let us fetch the ark of the covenant of the
        LORD out of Shiloh unto us, that, when it cometh among us, it
        may save us out of the hand of our enemies.

004:004 So the people sent to Shiloh, that they might bring from
        thence the ark of the covenant of the LORD of hosts, which
        dwelleth between the cherubims: and the two sons of Eli,
        Hophni and Phinehas, were there with the ark of the covenant
        of God.

004:005 And when the ark of the covenant of the LORD came into the
        camp, all Israel shouted with a great shout, so that the earth
        rang again.

004:006 And when the Philistines heard the noise of the shout, they
        said, What meaneth the noise of this great shout in the camp
        of the Hebrews? And they understood that the ark of the LORD
        was come into the camp.

004:007 And the Philistines were afraid, for they said, God is come
        into the camp. And they said, Woe unto us! for there hath not
        been such a thing heretofore.

004:008 Woe unto us! who shall deliver us out of the hand of these
        mighty Gods? these are the Gods that smote the Egyptians with
        all the plagues in the wilderness.

004:009 Be strong and quit yourselves like men, O ye Philistines, that
        ye be not servants unto the Hebrews, as they have been to you:
        quit yourselves like men, and fight.

004:010 And the Philistines fought, and Israel was smitten, and they
        fled every man into his tent: and there was a very great
        slaughter; for there fell of Israel thirty thousand footmen.

004:011 And the ark of God was taken; and the two sons of Eli, Hophni
        and Phinehas, were slain.

004:012 And there ran a man of Benjamin out of the army, and came to
        Shiloh the same day with his clothes rent, and with earth upon
        his head.

004:013 And when he came, lo, Eli sat upon a seat by the wayside
        watching: for his heart trembled for the ark of God. And when
        the man came into the city, and told it, all the city cried
        out.

004:014 And when Eli heard the noise of the crying, he said, What
        meaneth the noise of this tumult? And the man came in hastily,
        and told Eli.

004:015 Now Eli was ninety and eight years old; and his eyes were dim,
        that he could not see.

004:016 And the man said unto Eli, I am he that came out of the army,
        and I fled to day out of the army. And he said, What is there
        done, my son?

004:017 And the messenger answered and said, Israel is fled before the
        Philistines, and there hath been also a great slaughter among
        the people, and thy two sons also, Hophni and Phinehas, are
        dead, and the ark of God is taken.

004:018 And it came to pass, when he made mention of the ark of God,
        that he fell from off the seat backward by the side of the
        gate, and his neck brake, and he died: for he was an old man,
        and heavy. And he had judged Israel forty years.

004:019 And his daughter in law, Phinehas' wife, was with child, near
        to be delivered: and when she heard the tidings that the ark
        of God was taken, and that her father in law and her husband
        were dead, she bowed herself and travailed; for her pains came
        upon her.

004:020 And about the time of her death the women that stood by her
        said unto her, Fear not; for thou hast born a son. But she
        answered not, neither did she regard it.

004:021 And she named the child Ichabod, saying, The glory is departed
        from Israel: because the ark of God was taken, and because of
        her father in law and her husband.

004:022 And she said, The glory is departed from Israel: for the ark
        of God is taken.

005:001 And the Philistines took the ark of God, and brought it from
        Ebenezer unto Ashdod.

005:002 When the Philistines took the ark of God, they brought it into
        the house of Dagon, and set it by Dagon.

005:003 And when they of Ashdod arose early on the morrow, behold,
        Dagon was fallen upon his face to the earth before the ark of
        the LORD. And they took Dagon, and set him in his place again.

005:004 And when they arose early on the morrow morning, behold, Dagon
        was fallen upon his face to the ground before the ark of the
        LORD; and the head of Dagon and both the palms of his hands
        were cut off upon the threshold; only the stump of Dagon was
        left to him.

005:005 Therefore neither the priests of Dagon, nor any that come into
        Dagon's house, tread on the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod unto
        this day.

005:006 But the hand of the LORD was heavy upon them of Ashdod, and he
        destroyed them, and smote them with emerods, even Ashdod and
        the coasts thereof.

005:007 And when the men of Ashdod saw that it was so, they said, The
        ark of the God of Israel shall not abide with us: for his hand
        is sore upon us, and upon Dagon our god.

005:008 They sent therefore and gathered all the lords of the
        Philistines unto them, and said, What shall we do with the ark
        of the God of Israel? And they answered, Let the ark of the
        God of Israel be carried about unto Gath. And they carried the
        ark of the God of Israel about thither.

005:009 And it was so, that, after they had carried it about, the hand
        of the LORD was against the city with a very great
        destruction: and he smote the men of the city, both small and
        great, and they had emerods in their secret parts.

005:010 Therefore they sent the ark of God to Ekron. And it came to
        pass, as the ark of God came to Ekron, that the Ekronites
        cried out, saying, They have brought about the ark of the God
        of Israel to us, to slay us and our people.

005:011 So they sent and gathered together all the lords of the
        Philistines, and said, Send away the ark of the God of Israel,
        and let it go again to his own place, that it slay us not, and
        our people: for there was a deadly destruction throughout all
        the city; the hand of God was very heavy there.

005:012 And the men that died not were smitten with the emerods: and
        the cry of the city went up to heaven.

006:001 And the ark of the LORD was in the country of the Philistines
        seven months.

006:002 And the Philistines called for the priests and the diviners,
        saying, What shall we do to the ark of the LORD? tell us
        wherewith we shall send it to his place.

006:003 And they said, If ye send away the ark of the God of Israel,
        send it not empty; but in any wise return him a trespass
        offering: then ye shall be healed, and it shall be known to
        you why his hand is not removed from you.

006:004 Then said they, What shall be the trespass offering which we
        shall return to him? They answered, Five golden emerods, and
        five golden mice, according to the number of the lords of the
        Philistines: for one plague was on you all, and on your lords.

006:005 Wherefore ye shall make images of your emerods, and images of
        your mice that mar the land; and ye shall give glory unto the
        God of Israel: peradventure he will lighten his hand from off
        you, and from off your gods, and from off your land.

006:006 Wherefore then do ye harden your hearts, as the Egyptians and
        Pharaoh hardened their hearts? when he had wrought wonderfully
        among them, did they not let the people go, and they departed?

006:007 Now therefore make a new cart, and take two milch kine, on
        which there hath come no yoke, and tie the kine to the cart,
        and bring their calves home from them:

006:008 And take the ark of the LORD, and lay it upon the cart; and
        put the jewels of gold, which ye return him for a trespass
        offering, in a coffer by the side thereof; and send it away,
        that it may go.

006:009 And see, if it goeth up by the way of his own coast to
        Bethshemesh, then he hath done us this great evil: but if not,
        then we shall know that it is not his hand that smote us: it
        was a chance that happened to us.

006:010 And the men did so; and took two milch kine, and tied them to
        the cart, and shut up their calves at home:

006:011 And they laid the ark of the LORD upon the cart, and the
        coffer with the mice of gold and the images of their emerods.

006:012 And the kine took the straight way to the way of Bethshemesh,
        and went along the highway, lowing as they went, and turned
        not aside to the right hand or to the left; and the lords of
        the Philistines went after them unto the border of
        Bethshemesh.

006:013 And they of Bethshemesh were reaping their wheat harvest in
        the valley: and they lifted up their eyes, and saw the ark,
        and rejoiced to see it.

006:014 And the cart came into the field of Joshua, a Bethshemite, and
        stood there, where there was a great stone: and they clave the
        wood of the cart, and offered the kine a burnt offering unto
        the LORD.

006:015 And the Levites took down the ark of the LORD, and the coffer
        that was with it, wherein the jewels of gold were, and put
        them on the great stone: and the men of Bethshemesh offered
        burnt offerings and sacrificed sacrifices the same day unto
        the LORD.

006:016 And when the five lords of the Philistines had seen it, they
        returned to Ekron the same day.

006:017 And these are the golden emerods which the Philistines
        returned for a trespass offering unto the LORD; for Ashdod
        one, for Gaza one, for Askelon one, for Gath one, for Ekron
        one;

006:018 And the golden mice, according to the number of all the cities
        of the Philistines belonging to the five lords, both of fenced
        cities, and of country villages, even unto the great stone of
        Abel, whereon they set down the ark of the LORD: which stone
        remaineth unto this day in the field of Joshua, the
        Bethshemite.

006:019 And he smote the men of Bethshemesh, because they had looked
        into the ark of the LORD, even he smote of the people fifty
        thousand and threescore and ten men: and the people lamented,
        because the LORD had smitten many of the people with a great
        slaughter.

006:020 And the men of Bethshemesh said, Who is able to stand before
        this holy LORD God? and to whom shall he go up from us?

006:021 And they sent messengers to the inhabitants of Kirjathjearim,
        saying, The Philistines have brought again the ark of the
        LORD; come ye down, and fetch it up to you.

007:001 And the men of Kirjathjearim came, and fetched up the ark of
        the LORD, and brought it into the house of Abinadab in the
        hill, and sanctified Eleazar his son to keep the ark of the
        LORD.

007:002 And it came to pass, while the ark abode in Kirjathjearim,
        that the time was long; for it was twenty years: and all the
        house of Israel lamented after the LORD.

007:003 And Samuel spake unto all the house of Israel, saying, If ye
        do return unto the LORD with all your hearts, then put away
        the strange gods and Ashtaroth from among you, and prepare
        your hearts unto the LORD, and serve him only: and he will
        deliver you out of the hand of the Philistines.

007:004 Then the children of Israel did put away Baalim and Ashtaroth,
        and served the LORD only.

007:005 And Samuel said, Gather all Israel to Mizpeh, and I will pray
        for you unto the LORD.

007:006 And they gathered together to Mizpeh, and drew water, and
        poured it out before the LORD, and fasted on that day, and
        said there, We have sinned against the LORD. And Samuel judged
        the children of Israel in Mizpeh.

007:007 And when the Philistines heard that the children of Israel
        were gathered together to Mizpeh, the lords of the Philistines
        went up against Israel. And when the children of Israel heard
        it, they were afraid of the Philistines.

007:008 And the children of Israel said to Samuel, Cease not to cry
        unto the LORD our God for us, that he will save us out of the
        hand of the Philistines.

007:009 And Samuel took a sucking lamb, and offered it for a burnt
        offering wholly unto the LORD: and Samuel cried unto the LORD
        for Israel; and the LORD heard him.

007:010 And as Samuel was offering up the burnt offering, the
        Philistines drew near to battle against Israel: but the LORD
        thundered with a great thunder on that day upon the
        Philistines, and discomfited them; and they were smitten
        before Israel.

007:011 And the men of Israel went out of Mizpeh, and pursued the
        Philistines, and smote them, until they came under Bethcar.

007:012 Then Samuel took a stone, and set it between Mizpeh and Shen,
        and called the name of it Ebenezer, saying, Hitherto hath the
        LORD helped us.

007:013 So the Philistines were subdued, and they came no more into
        the coast of Israel: and the hand of the LORD was against the
        Philistines all the days of Samuel.

007:014 And the cities which the Philistines had taken from Israel
        were restored to Israel, from Ekron even unto Gath; and the
        coasts thereof did Israel deliver out of the hands of the
        Philistines. And there was peace between Israel and the
        Amorites.

007:015 And Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life.

007:016 And he went from year to year in circuit to Bethel, and
        Gilgal, and Mizpeh, and judged Israel in all those places.

007:017 And his return was to Ramah; for there was his house; and
        there he judged Israel; and there he built an altar unto the
        LORD.

008:001 And it came to pass, when Samuel was old, that he made his
        sons judges over Israel.

008:002 Now the name of his firstborn was Joel; and the name of his
        second, Abiah: they were judges in Beersheba.

008:003 And his sons walked not in his ways, but turned aside after
        lucre, and took bribes, and perverted judgment.

008:004 Then all the elders of Israel gathered themselves together,
        and came to Samuel unto Ramah,

008:005 And said unto him, Behold, thou art old, and thy sons walk not
        in thy ways: now make us a king to judge us like all the
        nations.

008:006 But the thing displeased Samuel, when they said, Give us a
        king to judge us. And Samuel prayed unto the LORD.

008:007 And the LORD said unto Samuel, Hearken unto the voice of the
        people in all that they say unto thee: for they have not
        rejected thee, but they have rejected me, that I should not
        reign over them.

008:008 According to all the works which they have done since the day
        that I brought them up out of Egypt even unto this day,
        wherewith they have forsaken me, and served other gods, so do
        they also unto thee.

008:009 Now therefore hearken unto their voice: howbeit yet protest
        solemnly unto them, and shew them the manner of the king that
        shall reign over them.

008:010 And Samuel told all the words of the LORD unto the people that
        asked of him a king.

008:011 And he said, This will be the manner of the king that shall
        reign over you: He will take your sons, and appoint them for
        himself, for his chariots, and to be his horsemen; and some
        shall run before his chariots.

008:012 And he will appoint him captains over thousands, and captains
        over fifties; and will set them to ear his ground, and to reap
        his harvest, and to make his instruments of war, and
        instruments of his chariots.

008:013 And he will take your daughters to be confectionaries, and to
        be cooks, and to be bakers.

008:014 And he will take your fields, and your vineyards, and your
        oliveyards, even the best of them, and give them to his
        servants.

008:015 And he will take the tenth of your seed, and of your
        vineyards, and give to his officers, and to his servants.

008:016 And he will take your menservants, and your maidservants, and
        your goodliest young men, and your asses, and put them to his
        work.

008:017 He will take the tenth of your sheep: and ye shall be his
        servants.

008:018 And ye shall cry out in that day because of your king which ye
        shall have chosen you; and the LORD will not hear you in that
        day.

008:019 Nevertheless the people refused to obey the voice of Samuel;
        and they said, Nay; but we will have a king over us;

008:020 That we also may be like all the nations; and that our king
        may judge us, and go out before us, and fight our battles.

008:021 And Samuel heard all the words of the people, and he rehearsed
        them in the ears of the LORD.

008:022 And the LORD said to Samuel, Hearken unto their voice, and
        make them a king. And Samuel said unto the men of Israel, Go
        ye every man unto his city.

009:001 Now there was a man of Benjamin, whose name was Kish, the son
        of Abiel, the son of Zeror, the son of Bechorath, the son of
        Aphiah, a Benjamite, a mighty man of power.

009:002 And he had a son, whose name was Saul, a choice young man, and
        a goodly: and there was not among the children of Israel a
        goodlier person than he: from his shoulders and upward he was
        higher than any of the people.

009:003 And the asses of Kish Saul's father were lost. And Kish said
        to Saul his son, Take now one of the servants with thee, and
        arise, go seek the asses.

009:004 And he passed through mount Ephraim, and passed through the
        land of Shalisha, but they found them not: then they passed
        through the land of Shalim, and there they were not: and he
        passed through the land of the Benjamites, but they found them
        not.

009:005 And when they were come to the land of Zuph, Saul said to his
        servant that was with him, Come, and let us return; lest my
        father leave caring for the asses, and take thought for us.

009:006 And he said unto him, Behold now, there is in this city a man
        of God, and he is an honourable man; all that he saith cometh
        surely to pass: now let us go thither; peradventure he can
        shew us our way that we should go.

009:007 Then said Saul to his servant, But, behold, if we go, what
        shall we bring the man? for the bread is spent in our vessels,
        and there is not a present to bring to the man of God: what
        have we?

009:008 And the servant answered Saul again, and said, Behold, I have
        here at hand the fourth part of a shekel of silver: that will
        I give to the man of God, to tell us our way.

009:009 (Beforetime in Israel, when a man went to enquire of God, thus
        he spake, Come, and let us go to the seer: for he that is now
        called a Prophet was beforetime called a Seer.)

009:010 Then said Saul to his servant, Well said; come, let us go. So
        they went unto the city where the man of God was.

009:011 And as they went up the hill to the city, they found young
        maidens going out to draw water, and said unto them, Is the
        seer here?

009:012 And they answered them, and said, He is; behold, he is before
        you: make haste now, for he came to day to the city; for there
        is a sacrifice of the people to day in the high place:

009:013 As soon as ye be come into the city, ye shall straightway find
        him, before he go up to the high place to eat: for the people
        will not eat until he come, because he doth bless the
        sacrifice; and afterwards they eat that be bidden. Now
        therefore get you up; for about this time ye shall find him.

009:014 And they went up into the city: and when they were come into
        the city, behold, Samuel came out against them, for to go up
        to the high place.

009:015 Now the LORD had told Samuel in his ear a day before Saul
        came, saying,

009:016 To morrow about this time I will send thee a man out of the
        land of Benjamin, and thou shalt anoint him to be captain over
        my people Israel, that he may save my people out of the hand
        of the Philistines: for I have looked upon my people, because
        their cry is come unto me.

009:017 And when Samuel saw Saul, the LORD said unto him, Behold the
        man whom I spake to thee of! this same shall reign over my
        people.

009:018 Then Saul drew near to Samuel in the gate, and said, Tell me,
        I pray thee, where the seer's house is.

009:019 And Samuel answered Saul, and said, I am the seer: go up
        before me unto the high place; for ye shall eat with me to
        day, and to morrow I will let thee go, and will tell thee all
        that is in thine heart.

009:020 And as for thine asses that were lost three days ago, set not
        thy mind on them; for they are found. And on whom is all the
        desire of Israel? Is it not on thee, and on all thy father's
        house?

009:021 And Saul answered and said, Am not I a Benjamite, of the
        smallest of the tribes of Israel? and my family the least of
        all the families of the tribe of Benjamin? wherefore then
        speakest thou so to me?

009:022 And Samuel took Saul and his servant, and brought them into
        the parlour, and made them sit in the chiefest place among
        them that were bidden, which were about thirty persons.

009:023 And Samuel said unto the cook, Bring the portion which I gave
        thee, of which I said unto thee, Set it by thee.

009:024 And the cook took up the shoulder, and that which was upon it,
        and set it before Saul. And Samuel said, Behold that which is
        left! set it before thee, and eat: for unto this time hath it
        been kept for thee since I said, I have invited the people. So
        Saul did eat with Samuel that day.

009:025 And when they were come down from the high place into the
        city, Samuel communed with Saul upon the top of the house.

009:026 And they arose early: and it came to pass about the spring of
        the day, that Samuel called Saul to the top of the house,
        saying, Up, that I may send thee away. And Saul arose, and
        they went out both of them, he and Samuel, abroad.

009:027 And as they were going down to the end of the city, Samuel
        said to Saul, Bid the servant pass on before us, (and he
        passed on), but stand thou still a while, that I may shew thee
        the word of God.

010:001 Then Samuel took a vial of oil, and poured it upon his head,
        and kissed him, and said, Is it not because the LORD hath
        anointed thee to be captain over his inheritance?

010:002 When thou art departed from me to day, then thou shalt find
        two men by Rachel's sepulchre in the border of Benjamin at
        Zelzah; and they will say unto thee, The asses which thou
        wentest to seek are found: and, lo, thy father hath left the
        care of the asses, and sorroweth for you, saying, What shall I
        do for my son?

010:003 Then shalt thou go on forward from thence, and thou shalt come
        to the plain of Tabor, and there shall meet thee three men
        going up to God to Bethel, one carrying three kids, and
        another carrying three loaves of bread, and another carrying a
        bottle of wine:

010:004 And they will salute thee, and give thee two loaves of bread;
        which thou shalt receive of their hands.

010:005 After that thou shalt come to the hill of God, where is the
        garrison of the Philistines: and it shall come to pass, when
        thou art come thither to the city, that thou shalt meet a
        company of prophets coming down from the high place with a
        psaltery, and a tabret, and a pipe, and a harp, before them;
        and they shall prophesy:

010:006 And the Spirit of the LORD will come upon thee, and thou shalt
        prophesy with them, and shalt be turned into another man.

010:007 And let it be, when these signs are come unto thee, that thou
        do as occasion serve thee; for God is with thee.

010:008 And thou shalt go down before me to Gilgal; and, behold, I
        will come down unto thee, to offer burnt offerings, and to
        sacrifice sacrifices of peace offerings: seven days shalt thou
        tarry, till I come to thee, and shew thee what thou shalt do.

010:009 And it was so, that when he had turned his back to go from
        Samuel, God gave him another heart: and all those signs came
        to pass that day.

010:010 And when they came thither to the hill, behold, a company of
        prophets met him; and the Spirit of God came upon him, and he
        prophesied among them.

010:011 And it came to pass, when all that knew him beforetime saw
        that, behold, he prophesied among the prophets, then the
        people said one to another, What is this that is come unto the
        son of Kish? Is Saul also among the prophets?

010:012 And one of the same place answered and said, But who is their
        father? Therefore it became a proverb, Is Saul also among the
        prophets?

010:013 And when he had made an end of prophesying, he came to the
        high place.

010:014 And Saul's uncle said unto him and to his servant, Whither
        went ye? And he said, To seek the asses: and when we saw that
        they were no where, we came to Samuel.

010:015 And Saul's uncle said, Tell me, I pray thee, what Samuel said
        unto you.

010:016 And Saul said unto his uncle, He told us plainly that the
        asses were found. But of the matter of the kingdom, whereof
        Samuel spake, he told him not.

010:017 And Samuel called the people together unto the LORD to Mizpeh;

010:018 And said unto the children of Israel, Thus saith the LORD God
        of Israel, I brought up Israel out of Egypt, and delivered you
        out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of all
        kingdoms, and of them that oppressed you:

010:019 And ye have this day rejected your God, who himself saved you
        out of all your adversities and your tribulations; and ye have
        said unto him, Nay, but set a king over us. Now therefore
        present yourselves before the LORD by your tribes, and by your
        thousands.

010:020 And when Samuel had caused all the tribes of Israel to come
        near, the tribe of Benjamin was taken.

010:021 When he had caused the tribe of Benjamin to come near by their
        families, the family of Matri was taken, and Saul the son of
        Kish was taken: and when they sought him, he could not be
        found.

010:022 Therefore they enquired of the LORD further, if the man should
        yet come thither. And the LORD answered, Behold he hath hid
        himself among the stuff.

010:023 And they ran and fetched him thence: and when he stood among
        the people, he was higher than any of the people from his
        shoulders and upward.

010:024 And Samuel said to all the people, See ye him whom the LORD
        hath chosen, that there is none like him among all the people?
        And all the people shouted, and said, God save the king.

010:025 Then Samuel told the people the manner of the kingdom, and
        wrote it in a book, and laid it up before the LORD. And Samuel
        sent all the people away, every man to his house.

010:026 And Saul also went home to Gibeah; and there went with him a
        band of men, whose hearts God had touched.

010:027 But the children of Belial said, How shall this man save us?
        And they despised him, and brought no presents. But he held
        his peace.

011:001 Then Nahash the Ammonite came up, and encamped against
        Jabeshgilead: and all the men of Jabesh said unto Nahash, Make
        a covenant with us, and we will serve thee.

011:002 And Nahash the Ammonite answered them, On this condition will
        I make a covenant with you, that I may thrust out all your
        right eyes, and lay it for a reproach upon all Israel.

011:003 And the elders of Jabesh said unto him, Give us seven days'
        respite, that we may send messengers unto all the coasts of
        Israel: and then, if there be no man to save us, we will come
        out to thee.

011:004 Then came the messengers to Gibeah of Saul, and told the
        tidings in the ears of the people: and all the people lifted
        up their voices, and wept.

011:005 And, behold, Saul came after the herd out of the field; and
        Saul said, What aileth the people that they weep? And they
        told him the tidings of the men of Jabesh.

011:006 And the Spirit of God came upon Saul when he heard those
        tidings, and his anger was kindled greatly.

011:007 And he took a yoke of oxen, and hewed them in pieces, and sent
        them throughout all the coasts of Israel by the hands of
        messengers, saying, Whosoever cometh not forth after Saul and
        after Samuel, so shall it be done unto his oxen. And the fear
        of the LORD fell on the people, and they came out with one
        consent.

011:008 And when he numbered them in Bezek, the children of Israel
        were three hundred thousand, and the men of Judah thirty
        thousand.

011:009 And they said unto the messengers that came, Thus shall ye say
        unto the men of Jabeshgilead, To morrow, by that time the sun
        be hot, ye shall have help. And the messengers came and shewed
        it to the men of Jabesh; and they were glad.

011:010 Therefore the men of Jabesh said, To morrow we will come out
        unto you, and ye shall do with us all that seemeth good unto
        you.

011:011 And it was so on the morrow, that Saul put the people in three
        companies; and they came into the midst of the host in the
        morning watch, and slew the Ammonites until the heat of the
        day: and it came to pass, that they which remained were
        scattered, so that two of them were not left together.

011:012 And the people said unto Samuel, Who is he that said, Shall
        Saul reign over us? bring the men, that we may put them to
        death.

011:013 And Saul said, There shall not a man be put to death this day:
        for to day the LORD hath wrought salvation in Israel.

011:014 Then said Samuel to the people, Come, and let us go to Gilgal,
        and renew the kingdom there.

011:015 And all the people went to Gilgal; and there they made Saul
        king before the LORD in Gilgal; and there they sacrificed
        sacrifices of peace offerings before the LORD; and there Saul
        and all the men of Israel rejoiced greatly.

012:001 And Samuel said unto all Israel, Behold, I have hearkened unto
        your voice in all that ye said unto me, and have made a king
        over you.

012:002 And now, behold, the king walketh before you: and I am old and
        grayheaded; and, behold, my sons are with you: and I have
        walked before you from my childhood unto this day.

012:003 Behold, here I am: witness against me before the LORD, and
        before his anointed: whose ox have I taken? or whose ass have
        I taken? or whom have I defrauded? whom have I oppressed? or
        of whose hand have I received any bribe to blind mine eyes
        therewith? and I will restore it you.

012:004 And they said, Thou hast not defrauded us, nor oppressed us,
        neither hast thou taken ought of any man's hand.

012:005 And he said unto them, The LORD is witness against you, and
        his anointed is witness this day, that ye have not found ought
        in my hand. And they answered, He is witness.

012:006 And Samuel said unto the people, It is the LORD that advanced
        Moses and Aaron, and that brought your fathers up out of the
        land of Egypt.

012:007 Now therefore stand still, that I may reason with you before
        the LORD of all the righteous acts of the LORD, which he did
        to you and to your fathers.

012:008 When Jacob was come into Egypt, and your fathers cried unto
        the LORD, then the LORD sent Moses and Aaron, which brought
        forth your fathers out of Egypt, and made them dwell in this
        place.

012:009 And when they forgat the LORD their God, he sold them into the
        hand of Sisera, captain of the host of Hazor, and into the
        hand of the Philistines, and into the hand of the king of
        Moab, and they fought against them.

012:010 And they cried unto the LORD, and said, We have sinned,
        because we have forsaken the LORD, and have served Baalim and
        Ashtaroth: but now deliver us out of the hand of our enemies,
        and we will serve thee.

012:011 And the LORD sent Jerubbaal, and Bedan, and Jephthah, and
        Samuel, and delivered you out of the hand of your enemies on
        every side, and ye dwelled safe.

012:012 And when ye saw that Nahash the king of the children of Ammon
        came against you, ye said unto me, Nay; but a king shall reign
        over us: when the LORD your God was your king.

012:013 Now therefore behold the king whom ye have chosen, and whom ye
        have desired! and, behold, the LORD hath set a king over you.

012:014 If ye will fear the LORD, and serve him, and obey his voice,
        and not rebel against the commandment of the LORD, then shall
        both ye and also the king that reigneth over you continue
        following the LORD your God:

012:015 But if ye will not obey the voice of the LORD, but rebel
        against the commandment of the LORD, then shall the hand of
        the LORD be against you, as it was against your fathers.

012:016 Now therefore stand and see this great thing, which the LORD
        will do before your eyes.

012:017 Is it not wheat harvest to day? I will call unto the LORD, and
        he shall send thunder and rain; that ye may perceive and see
        that your wickedness is great, which ye have done in the sight
        of the LORD, in asking you a king.

012:018 So Samuel called unto the LORD; and the LORD sent thunder and
        rain that day: and all the people greatly feared the LORD and
        Samuel.

012:019 And all the people said unto Samuel, Pray for thy servants
        unto the LORD thy God, that we die not: for we have added unto
        all our sins this evil, to ask us a king.

012:020 And Samuel said unto the people, Fear not: ye have done all
        this wickedness: yet turn not aside from following the LORD,
        but serve the LORD with all your heart;

012:021 And turn ye not aside: for then should ye go after vain
        things, which cannot profit nor deliver; for they are vain.

012:022 For the LORD will not forsake his people for his great name's
        sake: because it hath pleased the LORD to make you his people.

012:023 Moreover as for me, God forbid that I should sin against the
        LORD in ceasing to pray for you: but I will teach you the good
        and the right way:

012:024 Only fear the LORD, and serve him in truth with all your
        heart: for consider how great things he hath done for you.

012:025 But if ye shall still do wickedly, ye shall be consumed, both
        ye and your king.

013:001 Saul reigned one year; and when he had reigned two years over
        Israel,

013:002 Saul chose him three thousand men of Israel; whereof two
        thousand were with Saul in Michmash and in mount Bethel, and a
        thousand were with Jonathan in Gibeah of Benjamin: and the
        rest of the people he sent every man to his tent.

013:003 And Jonathan smote the garrison of the Philistines that was in
        Geba, and the Philistines heard of it. And Saul blew the
        trumpet throughout all the land, saying, Let the Hebrews hear.

013:004 And all Israel heard say that Saul had smitten a garrison of
        the Philistines, and that Israel also was had in abomination
        with the Philistines. And the people were called together
        after Saul to Gilgal.

013:005 And the Philistines gathered themselves together to fight with
        Israel, thirty thousand chariots, and six thousand horsemen,
        and people as the sand which is on the sea shore in multitude:
        and they came up, and pitched in Michmash, eastward from
        Bethaven.

013:006 When the men of Israel saw that they were in a strait, (for
        the people were distressed,) then the people did hide
        themselves in caves, and in thickets, and in rocks, and in
        high places, and in pits.

013:007 And some of the Hebrews went over Jordan to the land of Gad
        and Gilead. As for Saul, he was yet in Gilgal, and all the
        people followed him trembling.

013:008 And he tarried seven days, according to the set time that
        Samuel had appointed: but Samuel came not to Gilgal; and the
        people were scattered from him.

013:009 And Saul said, Bring hither a burnt offering to me, and peace
        offerings. And he offered the burnt offering.

013:010 And it came to pass, that as soon as he had made an end of
        offering the burnt offering, behold, Samuel came; and Saul
        went out to meet him, that he might salute him.

013:011 And Samuel said, What hast thou done? And Saul said, Because I
        saw that the people were scattered from me, and that thou
        camest not within the days appointed, and that the Philistines
        gathered themselves together at Michmash;

013:012 Therefore said I, The Philistines will come down now upon me
        to Gilgal, and I have not made supplication unto the LORD: I
        forced myself therefore, and offered a burnt offering.

013:013 And Samuel said to Saul, Thou hast done foolishly: thou hast
        not kept the commandment of the LORD thy God, which he
        commanded thee: for now would the LORD have established thy
        kingdom upon Israel for ever.

013:014 But now thy kingdom shall not continue: the LORD hath sought
        him a man after his own heart, and the LORD hath commanded him
        to be captain over his people, because thou hast not kept that
        which the LORD commanded thee.

013:015 And Samuel arose, and gat him up from Gilgal unto Gibeah of
        Benjamin. And Saul numbered the people that were present with
        him, about six hundred men.

013:016 And Saul, and Jonathan his son, and the people that were
        present with them, abode in Gibeah of Benjamin: but the
        Philistines encamped in Michmash.

013:017 And the spoilers came out of the camp of the Philistines in
        three companies: one company turned unto the way that leadeth
        to Ophrah, unto the land of Shual:

013:018 And another company turned the way to Bethhoron: and another
        company turned to the way of the border that looketh to the
        valley of Zeboim toward the wilderness.

013:019 Now there was no smith found throughout all the land of
        Israel: for the Philistines said, Lest the Hebrews make them
        swords or spears:

013:020 But all the Israelites went down to the Philistines, to
        sharpen every man his share, and his coulter, and his axe, and
        his mattock.

013:021 Yet they had a file for the mattocks, and for the coulters,
        and for the forks, and for the axes, and to sharpen the goads.

013:022 So it came to pass in the day of battle, that there was
        neither sword nor spear found in the hand of any of the people
        that were with Saul and Jonathan: but with Saul and with
        Jonathan his son was there found.

013:023 And the garrison of the Philistines went out to the passage of
        Michmash.

014:001 Now it came to pass upon a day, that Jonathan the son of Saul
        said unto the young man that bare his armour, Come, and let us
        go over to the Philistines' garrison, that is on the other
        side. But he told not his father.

014:002 And Saul tarried in the uttermost part of Gibeah under a
        pomegranate tree which is in Migron: and the people that were
        with him were about six hundred men;

014:003 And Ahiah, the son of Ahitub, Ichabod's brother, the son of
        Phinehas, the son of Eli, the LORD's priest in Shiloh, wearing
        an ephod. And the people knew not that Jonathan was gone.

014:004 And between the passages, by which Jonathan sought to go over
        unto the Philistines' garrison, there was a sharp rock on the
        one side, and a sharp rock on the other side: and the name of
        the one was Bozez, and the name of the other Seneh.

014:005 The forefront of the one was situate northward over against
        Michmash, and the other southward over against Gibeah.

014:006 And Jonathan said to the young man that bare his armour, Come,
        and let us go over unto the garrison of these uncircumcised:
        it may be that the LORD will work for us: for there is no
        restraint to the LORD to save by many or by few.

014:007 And his armourbearer said unto him, Do all that is in thine
        heart: turn thee; behold, I am with thee according to thy
        heart.

014:008 Then said Jonathan, Behold, we will pass over unto these men,
        and we will discover ourselves unto them.

014:009 If they say thus unto us, Tarry until we come to you; then we
        will stand still in our place, and will not go up unto them.

014:010 But if they say thus, Come up unto us; then we will go up: for
        the LORD hath delivered them into our hand: and this shall be
        a sign unto us.

014:011 And both of them discovered themselves unto the garrison of
        the Philistines: and the Philistines said, Behold, the Hebrews
        come forth out of the holes where they had hid themselves.

014:012 And the men of the garrison answered Jonathan and his
        armourbearer, and said, Come up to us, and we will shew you a
        thing. And Jonathan said unto his armourbearer, Come up after
        me: for the LORD hath delivered them into the hand of Israel.

014:013 And Jonathan climbed up upon his hands and upon his feet, and
        his armourbearer after him: and they fell before Jonathan; and
        his armourbearer slew after him.

014:014 And that first slaughter, which Jonathan and his armourbearer
        made, was about twenty men, within as it were an half acre of
        land, which a yoke of oxen might plow.

014:015 And there was trembling in the host, in the field, and among
        all the people: the garrison, and the spoilers, they also
        trembled, and the earth quaked: so it was a very great
        trembling.

014:016 And the watchmen of Saul in Gibeah of Benjamin looked; and,
        behold, the multitude melted away, and they went on beating
        down one another.

014:017 Then said Saul unto the people that were with him, Number now,
        and see who is gone from us. And when they had numbered,
        behold, Jonathan and his armourbearer were not there.

014:018 And Saul said unto Ahiah, Bring hither the ark of God. For the
        ark of God was at that time with the children of Israel.

014:019 And it came to pass, while Saul talked unto the priest, that
        the noise that was in the host of the Philistines went on and
        increased: and Saul said unto the priest, Withdraw thine hand.

014:020 And Saul and all the people that were with him assembled
        themselves, and they came to the battle: and, behold, every
        man's sword was against his fellow, and there was a very great
        discomfiture.

014:021 Moreover the Hebrews that were with the Philistines before
        that time, which went up with them into the camp from the
        country round about, even they also turned to be with the
        Israelites that were with Saul and Jonathan.

014:022 Likewise all the men of Israel which had hid themselves in
        mount Ephraim, when they heard that the Philistines fled, even
        they also followed hard after them in the battle.

014:023 So the LORD saved Israel that day: and the battle passed over
        unto Bethaven.

014:024 And the men of Israel were distressed that day: for Saul had
        adjured the people, saying, Cursed be the man that eateth any
        food until evening, that I may be avenged on mine enemies. So
        none of the people tasted any food.

014:025 And all they of the land came to a wood; and there was honey
        upon the ground.

014:026 And when the people were come into the wood, behold, the honey
        dropped; but no man put his hand to his mouth: for the people
        feared the oath.

014:027 But Jonathan heard not when his father charged the people with
        the oath: wherefore he put forth the end of the rod that was
        in his hand, and dipped it in an honeycomb, and put his hand
        to his mouth; and his eyes were enlightened.

014:028 Then answered one of the people, and said, Thy father straitly
        charged the people with an oath, saying, Cursed be the man
        that eateth any food this day. And the people were faint.

014:029 Then said Jonathan, My father hath troubled the land: see, I
        pray you, how mine eyes have been enlightened, because I
        tasted a little of this honey.

014:030 How much more, if haply the people had eaten freely to day of
        the spoil of their enemies which they found? for had there not
        been now a much greater slaughter among the Philistines?

014:031 And they smote the Philistines that day from Michmash to
        Aijalon: and the people were very faint.

014:032 And the people flew upon the spoil, and took sheep, and oxen,
        and calves, and slew them on the ground: and the people did
        eat them with the blood.

014:033 Then they told Saul, saying, Behold, the people sin against
        the LORD, in that they eat with the blood. And he said, Ye
        have transgressed: roll a great stone unto me this day.

014:034 And Saul said, Disperse yourselves among the people, and say
        unto them, Bring me hither every man his ox, and every man his
        sheep, and slay them here, and eat; and sin not against the
        LORD in eating with the blood. And all the people brought
        every man his ox with him that night, and slew them there.

014:035 And Saul built an altar unto the LORD: the same was the first
        altar that he built unto the LORD.

014:036 And Saul said, Let us go down after the Philistines by night,
        and spoil them until the morning light, and let us not leave a
        man of them. And they said, Do whatsoever seemeth good unto
        thee. Then said the priest, Let us draw near hither unto God.

014:037 And Saul asked counsel of God, Shall I go down after the
        Philistines? wilt thou deliver them into the hand of Israel?
        But he answered him not that day.

014:038 And Saul said, Draw ye near hither, all the chief of the
        people: and know and see wherein this sin hath been this day.

014:039 For, as the LORD liveth, which saveth Israel, though it be in
        Jonathan my son, he shall surely die. But there was not a man
        among all the people that answered him.

014:040 Then said he unto all Israel, Be ye on one side, and I and
        Jonathan my son will be on the other side. And the people said
        unto Saul, Do what seemeth good unto thee.

014:041 Therefore Saul said unto the LORD God of Israel, Give a
        perfect lot. And Saul and Jonathan were taken: but the people
        escaped.

014:042 And Saul said, Cast lots between me and Jonathan my son. And
        Jonathan was taken.

014:043 Then Saul said to Jonathan, Tell me what thou hast done. And
        Jonathan told him, and said, I did but taste a little honey
        with the end of the rod that was in mine hand, and, lo, I must
        die.

014:044 And Saul answered, God do so and more also: for thou shalt
        surely die, Jonathan.

014:045 And the people said unto Saul, Shall Jonathan die, who hath
        wrought this great salvation in Israel? God forbid: as the
        LORD liveth, there shall not one hair of his head fall to the
        ground; for he hath wrought with God this day. So the people
        rescued Jonathan, that he died not.

014:046 Then Saul went up from following the Philistines: and the
        Philistines went to their own place.

014:047 So Saul took the kingdom over Israel, and fought against all
        his enemies on every side, against Moab, and against the
        children of Ammon, and against Edom, and against the kings of
        Zobah, and against the Philistines: and whithersoever he
        turned himself, he vexed them.

014:048 And he gathered an host, and smote the Amalekites, and
        delivered Israel out of the hands of them that spoiled them.

014:049 Now the sons of Saul were Jonathan, and Ishui, and Melchishua:
        and the names of his two daughters were these; the name of the
        firstborn Merab, and the name of the younger Michal:

014:050 And the name of Saul's wife was Ahinoam, the daughter of
        Ahimaaz: and the name of the captain of his host was Abner,
        the son of Ner, Saul's uncle.

014:051 And Kish was the father of Saul; and Ner the father of Abner
        was the son of Abiel.

014:052 And there was sore war against the Philistines all the days of
        Saul: and when Saul saw any strong man, or any valiant man, he
        took him unto him.

015:001 Samuel also said unto Saul, The LORD sent me to anoint thee to
        be king over his people, over Israel: now therefore hearken
        thou unto the voice of the words of the LORD.

015:002 Thus saith the LORD of hosts, I remember that which Amalek did
        to Israel, how he laid wait for him in the way, when he came
        up from Egypt.

015:003 Now go and smite Amalek, and utterly destroy all that they
        have, and spare them not; but slay both man and woman, infant
        and suckling, ox and sheep, camel and ass.

015:004 And Saul gathered the people together, and numbered them in
        Telaim, two hundred thousand footmen, and ten thousand men of
        Judah.

015:005 And Saul came to a city of Amalek, and laid wait in the
        valley.

015:006 And Saul said unto the Kenites, Go, depart, get you down from
        among the Amalekites, lest I destroy you with them: for ye
        shewed kindness to all the children of Israel, when they came
        up out of Egypt. So the Kenites departed from among the
        Amalekites.

015:007 And Saul smote the Amalekites from Havilah until thou comest
        to Shur, that is over against Egypt.

015:008 And he took Agag the king of the Amalekites alive, and utterly
        destroyed all the people with the edge of the sword.

015:009 But Saul and the people spared Agag, and the best of the
        sheep, and of the oxen, and of the fatlings, and the lambs,
        and all that was good, and would not utterly destroy them: but
        every thing that was vile and refuse, that they destroyed
        utterly.

015:010 Then came the word of the LORD unto Samuel, saying,

015:011 It repenteth me that I have set up Saul to be king: for he is
        turned back from following me, and hath not performed my
        commandments. And it grieved Samuel; and he cried unto the
        LORD all night.

015:012 And when Samuel rose early to meet Saul in the morning, it was
        told Samuel, saying, Saul came to Carmel, and, behold, he set
        him up a place, and is gone about, and passed on, and gone
        down to Gilgal.

015:013 And Samuel came to Saul: and Saul said unto him, Blessed be
        thou of the LORD: I have performed the commandment of the
        LORD.

015:014 And Samuel said, What meaneth then this bleating of the sheep
        in mine ears, and the lowing of the oxen which I hear?

015:015 And Saul said, They have brought them from the Amalekites: for
        the people spared the best of the sheep and of the oxen, to
        sacrifice unto the LORD thy God; and the rest we have utterly
        destroyed.

015:016 Then Samuel said unto Saul, Stay, and I will tell thee what
        the LORD hath said to me this night. And he said unto him, Say
        on.

015:017 And Samuel said, When thou wast little in thine own sight,
        wast thou not made the head of the tribes of Israel, and the
        LORD anointed thee king over Israel?

015:018 And the LORD sent thee on a journey, and said, Go and utterly
        destroy the sinners the Amalekites, and fight against them
        until they be consumed.

015:019 Wherefore then didst thou not obey the voice of the LORD, but
        didst fly upon the spoil, and didst evil in the sight of the
        LORD?

015:020 And Saul said unto Samuel, Yea, I have obeyed the voice of the
        LORD, and have gone the way which the LORD sent me, and have
        brought Agag the king of Amalek, and have utterly destroyed
        the Amalekites.

015:021 But the people took of the spoil, sheep and oxen, the chief of
        the things which should have been utterly destroyed, to
        sacrifice unto the LORD thy God in Gilgal.

015:022 And Samuel said, Hath the LORD as great delight in burnt
        offerings and sacrifices, as in obeying the voice of the LORD?
        Behold, to obey is better than sacrifice, and to hearken than
        the fat of rams.

015:023 For rebellion is as the sin of witchcraft, and stubbornness is
        as iniquity and idolatry. Because thou hast rejected the word
        of the LORD, he hath also rejected thee from being king.

015:024 And Saul said unto Samuel, I have sinned: for I have
        transgressed the commandment of the LORD, and thy words:
        because I feared the people, and obeyed their voice.

015:025 Now therefore, I pray thee, pardon my sin, and turn again with
        me, that I may worship the LORD.

015:026 And Samuel said unto Saul, I will not return with thee: for
        thou hast rejected the word of the LORD, and the LORD hath
        rejected thee from being king over Israel.

015:027 And as Samuel turned about to go away, he laid hold upon the
        skirt of his mantle, and it rent.

015:028 And Samuel said unto him, The LORD hath rent the kingdom of
        Israel from thee this day, and hath given it to a neighbour of
        thine, that is better than thou.

015:029 And also the Strength of Israel will not lie nor repent: for
        he is not a man, that he should repent.

015:030 Then he said, I have sinned: yet honour me now, I pray thee,
        before the elders of my people, and before Israel, and turn
        again with me, that I may worship the LORD thy God.

015:031 So Samuel turned again after Saul; and Saul worshipped the
        LORD.

015:032 Then said Samuel, Bring ye hither to me Agag the king of the
        Amalekites. And Agag came unto him delicately. And Agag said,
        Surely the bitterness of death is past.

015:033 And Samuel said, As the sword hath made women childless, so
        shall thy mother be childless among women. And Samuel hewed
        Agag in pieces before the LORD in Gilgal.

015:034 Then Samuel went to Ramah; and Saul went up to his house to
        Gibeah of Saul.

015:035 And Samuel came no more to see Saul until the day of his
        death: nevertheless Samuel mourned for Saul: and the LORD
        repented that he had made Saul king over Israel.

016:001 And the LORD said unto Samuel, How long wilt thou mourn for
        Saul, seeing I have rejected him from reigning over Israel?
        fill thine horn with oil, and go, I will send thee to Jesse
        the Bethlehemite: for I have provided me a king among his
        sons.

016:002 And Samuel said, How can I go? if Saul hear it, he will kill
        me. And the LORD said, Take an heifer with thee, and say, I am
        come to sacrifice to the LORD.

016:003 And call Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will shew thee what
        thou shalt do: and thou shalt anoint unto me him whom I name
        unto thee.

016:004 And Samuel did that which the LORD spake, and came to
        Bethlehem. And the elders of the town trembled at his coming,
        and said, Comest thou peaceably?

016:005 And he said, Peaceably: I am come to sacrifice unto the LORD:
        sanctify yourselves, and come with me to the sacrifice. And he
        sanctified Jesse and his sons, and called them to the
        sacrifice.

016:006 And it came to pass, when they were come, that he looked on
        Eliab, and said, Surely the LORD's anointed is before him.

016:007 But the LORD said unto Samuel, Look not on his countenance, or
        on the height of his stature; because I have refused him: for
        the LORD seeth not as man seeth; for man looketh on the
        outward appearance, but the LORD looketh on the heart.

016:008 Then Jesse called Abinadab, and made him pass before Samuel.
        And he said, Neither hath the LORD chosen this.

016:009 Then Jesse made Shammah to pass by. And he said, Neither hath
        the LORD chosen this.

016:010 Again, Jesse made seven of his sons to pass before Samuel. And
        Samuel said unto Jesse, The LORD hath not chosen these.

016:011 And Samuel said unto Jesse, Are here all thy children? And he
        said, There remaineth yet the youngest, and, behold, he
        keepeth the sheep. And Samuel said unto Jesse, Send and fetch
        him: for we will not sit down till he come hither.

016:012 And he sent, and brought him in. Now he was ruddy, and withal
        of a beautiful countenance, and goodly to look to. And the
        LORD said, Arise, anoint him: for this is he.

016:013 Then Samuel took the horn of oil, and anointed him in the
        midst of his brethren: and the Spirit of the LORD came upon
        David from that day forward. So Samuel rose up, and went to
        Ramah.

016:014 But the Spirit of the LORD departed from Saul, and an evil
        spirit from the LORD troubled him.

016:015 And Saul's servants said unto him, Behold now, an evil spirit
        from God troubleth thee.

016:016 Let our lord now command thy servants, which are before thee,
        to seek out a man, who is a cunning player on an harp: and it
        shall come to pass, when the evil spirit from God is upon
        thee, that he shall play with his hand, and thou shalt be
        well.

016:017 And Saul said unto his servants, Provide me now a man that can
        play well, and bring him to me.

016:018 Then answered one of the servants, and said, Behold, I have
        seen a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite, that is cunning in
        playing, and a mighty valiant man, and a man of war, and
        prudent in matters, and a comely person, and the LORD is with
        him.

016:019 Wherefore Saul sent messengers unto Jesse, and said, Send me
        David thy son, which is with the sheep.

016:020 And Jesse took an ass laden with bread, and a bottle of wine,
        and a kid, and sent them by David his son unto Saul.

016:021 And David came to Saul, and stood before him: and he loved him
        greatly; and he became his armourbearer.

016:022 And Saul sent to Jesse, saying, Let David, I pray thee, stand
        before me; for he hath found favour in my sight.

016:023 And it came to pass, when the evil spirit from God was upon
        Saul, that David took an harp, and played with his hand: so
        Saul was refreshed, and was well, and the evil spirit departed
        from him.

017:001 Now the Philistines gathered together their armies to battle,
        and were gathered together at Shochoh, which belongeth to
        Judah, and pitched between Shochoh and Azekah, in Ephesdammim.

017:002 And Saul and the men of Israel were gathered together, and
        pitched by the valley of Elah, and set the battle in array
        against the Philistines.

017:003 And the Philistines stood on a mountain on the one side, and
        Israel stood on a mountain on the other side: and there was a
        valley between them.

017:004 And there went out a champion out of the camp of the
        Philistines, named Goliath, of Gath, whose height was six
        cubits and a span.

017:005 And he had an helmet of brass upon his head, and he was armed
        with a coat of mail; and the weight of the coat was five
        thousand shekels of brass.

017:006 And he had greaves of brass upon his legs, and a target of
        brass between his shoulders.

017:007 And the staff of his spear was like a weaver's beam; and his
        spear's head weighed six hundred shekels of iron: and one
        bearing a shield went before him.

017:008 And he stood and cried unto the armies of Israel, and said
        unto them, Why are ye come out to set your battle in array? am
        not I a Philistine, and ye servants to Saul? choose you a man
        for you, and let him come down to me.

017:009 If he be able to fight with me, and to kill me, then will we
        be your servants: but if I prevail against him, and kill him,
        then shall ye be our servants, and serve us.

017:010 And the Philistine said, I defy the armies of Israel this day;
        give me a man, that we may fight together.

017:011 When Saul and all Israel heard those words of the Philistine,
        they were dismayed, and greatly afraid.

017:012 Now David was the son of that Ephrathite of Bethlehemjudah,
        whose name was Jesse; and he had eight sons: and the man went
        among men for an old man in the days of Saul.

017:013 And the three eldest sons of Jesse went and followed Saul to
        the battle: and the names of his three sons that went to the
        battle were Eliab the firstborn, and next unto him Abinadab,
        and the third Shammah.

017:014 And David was the youngest: and the three eldest followed
        Saul.

017:015 But David went and returned from Saul to feed his father's
        sheep at Bethlehem.

017:016 And the Philistine drew near morning and evening, and
        presented himself forty days.

017:017 And Jesse said unto David his son, Take now for thy brethren
        an ephah of this parched corn, and these ten loaves, and run
        to the camp of thy brethren;

017:018 And carry these ten cheeses unto the captain of their
        thousand, and look how thy brethren fare, and take their
        pledge.

017:019 Now Saul, and they, and all the men of Israel, were in the
        valley of Elah, fighting with the Philistines.

017:020 And David rose up early in the morning, and left the sheep
        with a keeper, and took, and went, as Jesse had commanded him;
        and he came to the trench, as the host was going forth to the
        fight, and shouted for the battle.

017:021 For Israel and the Philistines had put the battle in array,
        army against army.

017:022 And David left his carriage in the hand of the keeper of the
        carriage, and ran into the army, and came and saluted his
        brethren.

017:023 And as he talked with them, behold, there came up the
        champion, the Philistine of Gath, Goliath by name, out of the
        armies of the Philistines, and spake according to the same
        words: and David heard them.

017:024 And all the men of Israel, when they saw the man, fled from
        him, and were sore afraid.

017:025 And the men of Israel said, Have ye seen this man that is come
        up? surely to defy Israel is he come up: and it shall be, that
        the man who killeth him, the king will enrich him with great
        riches, and will give him his daughter, and make his father's
        house free in Israel.

017:026 And David spake to the men that stood by him, saying, What
        shall be done to the man that killeth this Philistine, and
        taketh away the reproach from Israel? for who is this
        uncircumcised Philistine, that he should defy the armies of
        the living God?

017:027 And the people answered him after this manner, saying, So
        shall it be done to the man that killeth him.

017:028 And Eliab his eldest brother heard when he spake unto the men;
        and Eliab's anger was kindled against David, and he said, Why
        camest thou down hither? and with whom hast thou left those
        few sheep in the wilderness? I know thy pride, and the
        naughtiness of thine heart; for thou art come down that thou
        mightest see the battle.

017:029 And David said, What have I now done? Is there not a cause?

017:030 And he turned from him toward another, and spake after the
        same manner: and the people answered him again after the
        former manner.

017:031 And when the words were heard which David spake, they
        rehearsed them before Saul: and he sent for him.

017:032 And David said to Saul, Let no man's heart fail because of
        him; thy servant will go and fight with this Philistine.

017:033 And Saul said to David, Thou art not able to go against this
        Philistine to fight with him: for thou art but a youth, and he
        a man of war from his youth.

017:034 And David said unto Saul, Thy servant kept his father's sheep,
        and there came a lion, and a bear, and took a lamb out of the
        flock:

017:035 And I went out after him, and smote him, and delivered it out
        of his mouth: and when he arose against me, I caught him by
        his beard, and smote him, and slew him.

017:036 Thy servant slew both the lion and the bear: and this
        uncircumcised Philistine shall be as one of them, seeing he
        hath defied the armies of the living God.

017:037 David said moreover, The LORD that delivered me out of the paw
        of the lion, and out of the paw of the bear, he will deliver
        me out of the hand of this Philistine. And Saul said unto
        David, Go, and the LORD be with thee.

017:038 And Saul armed David with his armour, and he put an helmet of
        brass upon his head; also he armed him with a coat of mail.

017:039 And David girded his sword upon his armour, and he assayed to
        go; for he had not proved it. And David said unto Saul, I
        cannot go with these; for I have not proved them. And David
        put them off him.

017:040 And he took his staff in his hand, and chose him five smooth
        stones out of the brook, and put them in a shepherd's bag
        which he had, even in a scrip; and his sling was in his hand:
        and he drew near to the Philistine.

017:041 And the Philistine came on and drew near unto David; and the
        man that bare the shield went before him.

017:042 And when the Philistine looked about, and saw David, he
        disdained him: for he was but a youth, and ruddy, and of a
        fair countenance.

017:043 And the Philistine said unto David, Am I a dog, that thou
        comest to me with staves? And the Philistine cursed David by
        his gods.

017:044 And the Philistine said to David, Come to me, and I will give
        thy flesh unto the fowls of the air, and to the beasts of the
        field.

017:045 Then said David to the Philistine, Thou comest to me with a
        sword, and with a spear, and with a shield: but I come to thee
        in the name of the LORD of hosts, the God of the armies of
        Israel, whom thou hast defied.

017:046 This day will the LORD deliver thee into mine hand; and I will
        smite thee, and take thine head from thee; and I will give the
        carcases of the host of the Philistines this day unto the
        fowls of the air, and to the wild beasts of the earth; that
        all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel.

017:047 And all this assembly shall know that the LORD saveth not with
        sword and spear: for the battle is the LORD's, and he will
        give you into our hands.

017:048 And it came to pass, when the Philistine arose, and came, and
        drew nigh to meet David, that David hastened, and ran toward
        the army to meet the Philistine.

017:049 And David put his hand in his bag, and took thence a stone,
        and slang it, and smote the Philistine in his forehead, that
        the stone sunk into his forehead; and he fell upon his face to
        the earth.

017:050 So David prevailed over the Philistine with a sling and with a
        stone, and smote the Philistine, and slew him; but there was
        no sword in the hand of David.

017:051 Therefore David ran, and stood upon the Philistine, and took
        his sword, and drew it out of the sheath thereof, and slew
        him, and cut off his head therewith. And when the Philistines
        saw their champion was dead, they fled.

017:052 And the men of Israel and of Judah arose, and shouted, and
        pursued the Philistines, until thou come to the valley, and to
        the gates of Ekron. And the wounded of the Philistines fell
        down by the way to Shaaraim, even unto Gath, and unto Ekron.

017:053 And the children of Israel returned from chasing after the
        Philistines, and they spoiled their tents.

017:054 And David took the head of the Philistine, and brought it to
        Jerusalem; but he put his armour in his tent.

017:055 And when Saul saw David go forth against the Philistine, he
        said unto Abner, the captain of the host, Abner, whose son is
        this youth? And Abner said, As thy soul liveth, O king, I
        cannot tell.

017:056 And the king said, Enquire thou whose son the stripling is.

017:057 And as David returned from the slaughter of the Philistine,
        Abner took him, and brought him before Saul with the head of
        the Philistine in his hand.

017:058 And Saul said to him, Whose son art thou, thou young man? And
        David answered, I am the son of thy servant Jesse the
        Bethlehemite.

018:001 And it came to pass, when he had made an end of speaking unto
        Saul, that the soul of Jonathan was knit with the soul of
        David, and Jonathan loved him as his own soul.

018:002 And Saul took him that day, and would let him go no more home
        to his father's house.

018:003 Then Jonathan and David made a covenant, because he loved him
        as his own soul.

018:004 And Jonathan stripped himself of the robe that was upon him,
        and gave it to David, and his garments, even to his sword, and
        to his bow, and to his girdle.

018:005 And David went out whithersoever Saul sent him, and behaved
        himself wisely: and Saul set him over the men of war, and he
        was accepted in the sight of all the people, and also in the
        sight of Saul's servants.

018:006 And it came to pass as they came, when David was returned from
        the slaughter of the Philistine, that the women came out of
        all cities of Israel, singing and dancing, to meet king Saul,
        with tabrets, with joy, and with instruments of musick.

018:007 And the women answered one another as they played, and said,
        Saul hath slain his thousands, and David his ten thousands.

018:008 And Saul was very wroth, and the saying displeased him; and he
        said, They have ascribed unto David ten thousands, and to me
        they have ascribed but thousands: and what can he have more
        but the kingdom?

018:009 And Saul eyed David from that day and forward.

018:010 And it came to pass on the morrow, that the evil spirit from
        God came upon Saul, and he prophesied in the midst of the
        house: and David played with his hand, as at other times: and
        there was a javelin in Saul's hand.

018:011 And Saul cast the javelin; for he said, I will smite David
        even to the wall with it. And David avoided out of his
        presence twice.

018:012 And Saul was afraid of David, because the LORD was with him,
        and was departed from Saul.

018:013 Therefore Saul removed him from him, and made him his captain
        over a thousand; and he went out and came in before the
        people.

018:014 And David behaved himself wisely in all his ways; and the LORD
        was with him.

018:015 Wherefore when Saul saw that he behaved himself very wisely,
        he was afraid of him.

018:016 But all Israel and Judah loved David, because he went out and
        came in before them.

018:017 And Saul said to David, Behold my elder daughter Merab, her
        will I give thee to wife: only be thou valiant for me, and
        fight the LORD's battles. For Saul said, Let not mine hand be
        upon him, but let the hand of the Philistines be upon him.

018:018 And David said unto Saul, Who am I? and what is my life, or my
        father's family in Israel, that I should be son in law to the
        king?

018:019 But it came to pass at the time when Merab Saul's daughter
        should have been given to David, that she was given unto
        Adriel the Meholathite to wife.

018:020 And Michal Saul's daughter loved David: and they told Saul,
        and the thing pleased him.

018:021 And Saul said, I will give him her, that she may be a snare to
        him, and that the hand of the Philistines may be against him.
        Wherefore Saul said to David, Thou shalt this day be my son in
        law in the one of the twain.

018:022 And Saul commanded his servants, saying, Commune with David
        secretly, and say, Behold, the king hath delight in thee, and
        all his servants love thee: now therefore be the king's son in
        law.

018:023 And Saul's servants spake those words in the ears of David.
        And David said, Seemeth it to you a light thing to be a king's
        son in law, seeing that I am a poor man, and lightly esteemed?

018:024 And the servants of Saul told him, saying, On this manner
        spake David.

018:025 And Saul said, Thus shall ye say to David, The king desireth
        not any dowry, but an hundred foreskins of the Philistines, to
        be avenged of the king's enemies. But Saul thought to make
        David fall by the hand of the Philistines.

018:026 And when his servants told David these words, it pleased David
        well to be the king's son in law: and the days were not
        expired.

018:027 Wherefore David arose and went, he and his men, and slew of
        the Philistines two hundred men; and David brought their
        foreskins, and they gave them in full tale to the king, that
        he might be the king's son in law. And Saul gave him Michal
        his daughter to wife.

018:028 And Saul saw and knew that the LORD was with David, and that
        Michal Saul's daughter loved him.

018:029 And Saul was yet the more afraid of David; and Saul became
        David's enemy continually.

018:030 Then the princes of the Philistines went forth: and it came to
        pass, after they went forth, that David behaved himself more
        wisely than all the servants of Saul; so that his name was
        much set by.

019:001 And Saul spake to Jonathan his son, and to all his servants,
        that they should kill David.

019:002 But Jonathan Saul's son delighted much in David: and Jonathan
        told David, saying, Saul my father seeketh to kill thee: now
        therefore, I pray thee, take heed to thyself until the
        morning, and abide in a secret place, and hide thyself:

019:003 And I will go out and stand beside my father in the field
        where thou art, and I will commune with my father of thee; and
        what I see, that I will tell thee.

019:004 And Jonathan spake good of David unto Saul his father, and
        said unto him, Let not the king sin against his servant,
        against David; because he hath not sinned against thee, and
        because his works have been to thee-ward very good:

019:005 For he did put his life in his hand, and slew the Philistine,
        and the LORD wrought a great salvation for all Israel: thou
        sawest it, and didst rejoice: wherefore then wilt thou sin
        against innocent blood, to slay David without a cause?

019:006 And Saul hearkened unto the voice of Jonathan: and Saul sware,
        As the LORD liveth, he shall not be slain.

019:007 And Jonathan called David, and Jonathan shewed him all those
        things. And Jonathan brought David to Saul, and he was in his
        presence, as in times past.

019:008 And there was war again: and David went out, and fought with
        the Philistines, and slew them with a great slaughter; and
        they fled from him.

019:009 And the evil spirit from the LORD was upon Saul, as he sat in
        his house with his javelin in his hand: and David played with
        his hand.

019:010 And Saul sought to smite David even to the wall with the
        javelin: but he slipped away out of Saul's presence, and he
        smote the javelin into the wall: and David fled, and escaped
        that night.

019:011 Saul also sent messengers unto David's house, to watch him,
        and to slay him in the morning: and Michal David's wife told
        him, saying, If thou save not thy life to night, to morrow
        thou shalt be slain.
