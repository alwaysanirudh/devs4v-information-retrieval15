036:034 And he overlaid the boards with gold, and made their rings of
        gold to be places for the bars, and overlaid the bars with
        gold.

036:035 And he made a vail of blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine
        twined linen: with cherubims made he it of cunning work.

036:036 And he made thereunto four pillars of shittim wood, and
        overlaid them with gold: their hooks were of gold; and he cast
        for them four sockets of silver.

036:037 And he made an hanging for the tabernacle door of blue, and
        purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen, of needlework;

036:038 And the five pillars of it with their hooks: and he overlaid
        their chapiters and their fillets with gold: but their five
        sockets were of brass.

037:001 And Bezaleel made the ark of shittim wood: two cubits and a
        half was the length of it, and a cubit and a half the breadth
        of it, and a cubit and a half the height of it:

037:002 And he overlaid it with pure gold within and without, and made
        a crown of gold to it round about.

037:003 And he cast for it four rings of gold, to be set by the four
        corners of it; even two rings upon the one side of it, and two
        rings upon the other side of it.

037:004 And he made staves of shittim wood, and overlaid them with
        gold.

037:005 And he put the staves into the rings by the sides of the ark,
        to bear the ark.

037:006 And he made the mercy seat of pure gold: two cubits and a half
        was the length thereof, and one cubit and a half the breadth
        thereof.

037:007 And he made two cherubims of gold, beaten out of one piece
        made he them, on the two ends of the mercy seat;

037:008 One cherub on the end on this side, and another cherub on the
        other end on that side: out of the mercy seat made he the
        cherubims on the two ends thereof.

037:009 And the cherubims spread out their wings on high, and covered
        with their wings over the mercy seat, with their faces one to
        another; even to the mercy seatward were the faces of the
        cherubims.

037:010 And he made the table of shittim wood: two cubits was the
        length thereof, and a cubit the breadth thereof, and a cubit
        and a half the height thereof:

037:011 And he overlaid it with pure gold, and made thereunto a crown
        of gold round about.

037:012 Also he made thereunto a border of an handbreadth round about;
        and made a crown of gold for the border thereof round about.

037:013 And he cast for it four rings of gold, and put the rings upon
        the four corners that were in the four feet thereof.

037:014 Over against the border were the rings, the places for the
        staves to bear the table.

037:015 And he made the staves of shittim wood, and overlaid them with
        gold, to bear the table.

037:016 And he made the vessels which were upon the table, his dishes,
        and his spoons, and his bowls, and his covers to cover withal,
        of pure gold.

037:017 And he made the candlestick of pure gold: of beaten work made
        he the candlestick; his shaft, and his branch, his bowls, his
        knops, and his flowers, were of the same:

037:018 And six branches going out of the sides thereof; three
        branches of the candlestick out of the one side thereof, and
        three branches of the candlestick out of the other side
        thereof:

037:019 Three bowls made after the fashion of almonds in one branch, a
        knop and a flower; and three bowls made like almonds in
        another branch, a knop and a flower: so throughout the six
        branches going out of the candlestick.

037:020 And in the candlestick were four bowls made like almonds, his
        knops, and his flowers:

037:021 And a knop under two branches of the same, and a knop under
        two branches of the same, and a knop under two branches of the
        same, according to the six branches going out of it.

037:022 Their knops and their branches were of the same: all of it was
        one beaten work of pure gold.

037:023 And he made his seven lamps, and his snuffers, and his
        snuffdishes, of pure gold.

037:024 Of a talent of pure gold made he it, and all the vessels
        thereof.

037:025 And he made the incense altar of shittim wood: the length of
        it was a cubit, and the breadth of it a cubit; it was
        foursquare; and two cubits was the height of it; the horns
        thereof were of the same.

037:026 And he overlaid it with pure gold, both the top of it, and the
        sides thereof round about, and the horns of it: also he made
        unto it a crown of gold round about.

037:027 And he made two rings of gold for it under the crown thereof,
        by the two corners of it, upon the two sides thereof, to be
        places for the staves to bear it withal.

037:028 And he made the staves of shittim wood, and overlaid them with
        gold.

037:029 And he made the holy anointing oil, and the pure incense of
        sweet spices, according to the work of the apothecary.

038:001 And he made the altar of burnt offering of shittim wood: five
        cubits was the length thereof, and five cubits the breadth
        thereof; it was foursquare; and three cubits the height
        thereof.

038:002 And he made the horns thereof on the four corners of it; the
        horns thereof were of the same: and he overlaid it with brass.

038:003 And he made all the vessels of the altar, the pots, and the
        shovels, and the basons, and the fleshhooks, and the firepans:
        all the vessels thereof made he of brass.

038:004 And he made for the altar a brasen grate of network under the
        compass thereof beneath unto the midst of it.

038:005 And he cast four rings for the four ends of the grate of
        brass, to be places for the staves.

038:006 And he made the staves of shittim wood, and overlaid them with
        brass.

038:007 And he put the staves into the rings on the sides of the
        altar, to bear it withal; he made the altar hollow with
        boards.

038:008 And he made the laver of brass, and the foot of it of brass,
        of the lookingglasses of the women assembling, which assembled
        at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.

038:009 And he made the court: on the south side southward the
        hangings of the court were of fine twined linen, an hundred
        cubits:

038:010 Their pillars were twenty, and their brasen sockets twenty;
        the hooks of the pillars and their fillets were of silver.

038:011 And for the north side the hangings were an hundred cubits,
        their pillars were twenty, and their sockets of brass twenty;
        the hooks of the pillars and their fillets of silver.

038:012 And for the west side were hangings of fifty cubits, their
        pillars ten, and their sockets ten; the hooks of the pillars
        and their fillets of silver.

038:013 And for the east side eastward fifty cubits.

038:014 The hangings of the one side of the gate were fifteen cubits;
        their pillars three, and their sockets three.

038:015 And for the other side of the court gate, on this hand and
        that hand, were hangings of fifteen cubits; their pillars
        three, and their sockets three.

038:016 All the hangings of the court round about were of fine twined
        linen.

038:017 And the sockets for the pillars were of brass; the hooks of
        the pillars and their fillets of silver; and the overlaying of
        their chapiters of silver; and all the pillars of the court
        were filleted with silver.

038:018 And the hanging for the gate of the court was needlework, of
        blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen: and
        twenty cubits was the length, and the height in the breadth
        was five cubits, answerable to the hangings of the court.

038:019 And their pillars were four, and their sockets of brass four;
        their hooks of silver, and the overlaying of their chapiters
        and their fillets of silver.

038:020 And all the pins of the tabernacle, and of the court round
        about, were of brass.

038:021 This is the sum of the tabernacle, even of the tabernacle of
        testimony, as it was counted, according to the commandment of
        Moses, for the service of the Levites, by the hand of Ithamar,
        son to Aaron the priest.

038:022 And Bezaleel the son Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of
        Judah, made all that the LORD commanded Moses.

038:023 And with him was Aholiab, son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of
        Dan, an engraver, and a cunning workman, and an embroiderer in
        blue, and in purple, and in scarlet, and fine linen.

038:024 All the gold that was occupied for the work in all the work of
        the holy place, even the gold of the offering, was twenty and
        nine talents, and seven hundred and thirty shekels, after the
        shekel of the sanctuary.

038:025 And the silver of them that were numbered of the congregation
        was an hundred talents, and a thousand seven hundred and
        threescore and fifteen shekels, after the shekel of the
        sanctuary:

038:026 A bekah for every man, that is, half a shekel, after the
        shekel of the sanctuary, for every one that went to be
        numbered, from twenty years old and upward, for six hundred
        thousand and three thousand and five hundred and fifty men.

038:027 And of the hundred talents of silver were cast the sockets of
        the sanctuary, and the sockets of the vail; an hundred sockets
        of the hundred talents, a talent for a socket.

038:028 And of the thousand seven hundred seventy and five shekels he
        made hooks for the pillars, and overlaid their chapiters, and
        filleted them.

038:029 And the brass of the offering was seventy talents, and two
        thousand and four hundred shekels.

038:030 And therewith he made the sockets to the door of the
        tabernacle of the congregation, and the brasen altar, and the
        brasen grate for it, and all the vessels of the altar,

038:031 And the sockets of the court round about, and the sockets of
        the court gate, and all the pins of the tabernacle, and all
        the pins of the court round about.

039:001 And of the blue, and purple, and scarlet, they made cloths of
        service, to do service in the holy place, and made the holy
        garments for Aaron; as the LORD commanded Moses.

039:002 And he made the ephod of gold, blue, and purple, and scarlet,
        and fine twined linen.

039:003 And they did beat the gold into thin plates, and cut it into
        wires, to work it in the blue, and in the purple, and in the
        scarlet, and in the fine linen, with cunning work.

039:004 They made shoulderpieces for it, to couple it together: by the
        two edges was it coupled together.

039:005 And the curious girdle of his ephod, that was upon it, was of
        the same, according to the work thereof; of gold, blue, and
        purple, and scarlet, and fine twined linen; as the LORD
        commanded Moses.

039:006 And they wrought onyx stones inclosed in ouches of gold,
        graven, as signets are graven, with the names of the children
        of Israel.

039:007 And he put them on the shoulders of the ephod, that they
        should be stones for a memorial to the children of Israel; as
        the LORD commanded Moses.

039:008 And he made the breastplate of cunning work, like the work of
        the ephod; of gold, blue, and purple, and scarlet, and fine
        twined linen.

039:009 It was foursquare; they made the breastplate double: a span
        was the length thereof, and a span the breadth thereof, being
        doubled.

039:010 And they set in it four rows of stones: the first row was a
        sardius, a topaz, and a carbuncle: this was the first row.

039:011 And the second row, an emerald, a sapphire, and a diamond.

039:012 And the third row, a ligure, an agate, and an amethyst.

039:013 And the fourth row, a beryl, an onyx, and a jasper: they were
        inclosed in ouches of gold in their inclosings.

039:014 And the stones were according to the names of the children of
        Israel, twelve, according to their names, like the engravings
        of a signet, every one with his name, according to the twelve
        tribes.

039:015 And they made upon the breastplate chains at the ends, of
        wreathen work of pure gold.

039:016 And they made two ouches of gold, and two gold rings; and put
        the two rings in the two ends of the breastplate.

039:017 And they put the two wreathen chains of gold in the two rings
        on the ends of the breastplate.

039:018 And the two ends of the two wreathen chains they fastened in
        the two ouches, and put them on the shoulderpieces of the
        ephod, before it.

039:019 And they made two rings of gold, and put them on the two ends
        of the breastplate, upon the border of it, which was on the
        side of the ephod inward.

039:020 And they made two other golden rings, and put them on the two
        sides of the ephod underneath, toward the forepart of it, over
        against the other coupling thereof, above the curious girdle
        of the ephod.

039:021 And they did bind the breastplate by his rings unto the rings
        of the ephod with a lace of blue, that it might be above the
        curious girdle of the ephod, and that the breastplate might
        not be loosed from the ephod; as the LORD commanded Moses.

039:022 And he made the robe of the ephod of woven work, all of blue.

039:023 And there was an hole in the midst of the robe, as the hole of
        an habergeon, with a band round about the hole, that it should
        not rend.

039:024 And they made upon the hems of the robe pomegranates of blue,
        and purple, and scarlet, and twined linen.

039:025 And they made bells of pure gold, and put the bells between
        the pomegranates upon the hem of the robe, round about between
        the pomegranates;

039:026 A bell and a pomegranate, a bell and a pomegranate, round
        about the hem of the robe to minister in; as the LORD
        commanded Moses.

039:027 And they made coats of fine linen of woven work for Aaron, and
        for his sons,

039:028 And a mitre of fine linen, and goodly bonnets of fine linen,
        and linen breeches of fine twined linen,

039:029 And a girdle of fine twined linen, and blue, and purple, and
        scarlet, of needlework; as the LORD commanded Moses.

039:030 And they made the plate of the holy crown of pure gold, and
        wrote upon it a writing, like to the engravings of a signet,
        HOLINESS TO THE LORD.

039:031 And they tied unto it a lace of blue, to fasten it on high
        upon the mitre; as the LORD commanded Moses.

039:032 Thus was all the work of the tabernacle of the tent of the
        congregation finished: and the children of Israel did
        according to all that the LORD commanded Moses, so did they.

039:033 And they brought the tabernacle unto Moses, the tent, and all
        his furniture, his taches, his boards, his bars, and his
        pillars, and his sockets,

039:034 And the covering of rams' skins dyed red, and the covering of
        badgers' skins, and the vail of the covering,

039:035 The ark of the testimony, and the staves thereof, and the
        mercy seat,

039:036 The table, and all the vessels thereof, and the shewbread,

039:037 The pure candlestick, with the lamps thereof, even with the
        lamps to be set in order, and all the vessels thereof, and the
        oil for light,

039:038 And the golden altar, and the anointing oil, and the sweet
        incense, and the hanging for the tabernacle door,

039:039 The brasen altar, and his grate of brass, his staves, and all
        his vessels, the laver and his foot,

039:040 The hangings of the court, his pillars, and his sockets, and
        the hanging for the court gate, his cords, and his pins, and
        all the vessels of the service of the tabernacle, for the tent
        of the congregation,

039:041 The cloths of service to do service in the holy place, and the
        holy garments for Aaron the priest, and his sons' garments, to
        minister in the priest's office.

039:042 According to all that the LORD commanded Moses, so the
        children of Israel made all the work.

039:043 And Moses did look upon all the work, and, behold, they had
        done it as the LORD had commanded, even so had they done it:
        and Moses blessed them.

040:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

040:002 On the first day of the first month shalt thou set up the
        tabernacle of the tent of the congregation.

040:003 And thou shalt put therein the ark of the testimony, and cover
        the ark with the vail.

040:004 And thou shalt bring in the table, and set in order the things
        that are to be set in order upon it; and thou shalt bring in
        the candlestick, and light the lamps thereof.

040:005 And thou shalt set the altar of gold for the incense before
        the ark of the testimony, and put the hanging of the door to
        the tabernacle.

040:006 And thou shalt set the altar of the burnt offering before the
        door of the tabernacle of the tent of the congregation.

040:007 And thou shalt set the laver between the tent of the
        congregation and the altar, and shalt put water therein.

040:008 And thou shalt set up the court round about, and hang up the
        hanging at the court gate.

040:009 And thou shalt take the anointing oil, and anoint the
        tabernacle, and all that is therein, and shalt hallow it, and
        all the vessels thereof: and it shall be holy.

040:010 And thou shalt anoint the altar of the burnt offering, and all
        his vessels, and sanctify the altar: and it shall be an altar
        most holy.

040:011 And thou shalt anoint the laver and his foot, and sanctify it.

040:012 And thou shalt bring Aaron and his sons unto the door of the
        tabernacle of the congregation, and wash them with water.

040:013 And thou shalt put upon Aaron the holy garments, and anoint
        him, and sanctify him; that he may minister unto me in the
        priest's office.

040:014 And thou shalt bring his sons, and clothe them with coats:

040:015 And thou shalt anoint them, as thou didst anoint their father,
        that they may minister unto me in the priest's office: for
        their anointing shall surely be an everlasting priesthood
        throughout their generations.

040:016 Thus did Moses: according to all that the LORD commanded him,
        so did he.

040:017 And it came to pass in the first month in the second year, on
        the first day of the month, that the tabernacle was reared up.

040:018 And Moses reared up the tabernacle, and fastened his sockets,
        and set up the boards thereof, and put in the bars thereof,
        and reared up his pillars.

040:019 And he spread abroad the tent over the tabernacle, and put the
        covering of the tent above upon it; as the LORD commanded
        Moses.

040:020 And he took and put the testimony into the ark, and set the
        staves on the ark, and put the mercy seat above upon the ark:

040:021 And he brought the ark into the tabernacle, and set up the
        vail of the covering, and covered the ark of the testimony; as
        the LORD commanded Moses.

040:022 And he put the table in the tent of the congregation, upon the
        side of the tabernacle northward, without the vail.

040:023 And he set the bread in order upon it before the LORD; as the
        LORD had commanded Moses.

040:024 And he put the candlestick in the tent of the congregation,
        over against the table, on the side of the tabernacle
        southward.

040:025 And he lighted the lamps before the LORD; as the LORD
        commanded Moses.

040:026 And he put the golden altar in the tent of the congregation
        before the vail:

040:027 And he burnt sweet incense thereon; as the LORD commanded
        Moses.

040:028 And he set up the hanging at the door of the tabernacle.

040:029 And he put the altar of burnt offering by the door of the
        tabernacle of the tent of the congregation, and offered upon
        it the burnt offering and the meat offering; as the LORD
        commanded Moses.

040:030 And he set the laver between the tent of the congregation and
        the altar, and put water there, to wash withal.

040:031 And Moses and Aaron and his sons washed their hands and their
        feet thereat:

040:032 When they went into the tent of the congregation, and when
        they came near unto the altar, they washed; as the LORD
        commanded Moses.

040:033 And he reared up the court round about the tabernacle and the
        altar, and set up the hanging of the court gate. So Moses
        finished the work.

040:034 Then a cloud covered the tent of the congregation, and the
        glory of the LORD filled the tabernacle.

040:035 And Moses was not able to enter into the tent of the
        congregation, because the cloud abode thereon, and the glory
        of the LORD filled the tabernacle.

040:036 And when the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle, the
        children of Israel went onward in all their journeys:

040:037 But if the cloud were not taken up, then they journeyed not
        till the day that it was taken up.

040:038 For the cloud of the LORD was upon the tabernacle by day, and
        fire was on it by night, in the sight of all the house of
        Israel, throughout all their journeys.

Book 03	Leviticus

001:001 And the LORD called unto Moses, and spake unto him out of the
        tabernacle of the congregation, saying,

001:002 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, If any
        man of you bring an offering unto the LORD, ye shall bring
        your offering of the cattle, even of the herd, and of the
        flock.

001:003 If his offering be a burnt sacrifice of the herd, let him
        offer a male without blemish: he shall offer it of his own
        voluntary will at the door of the tabernacle of the
        congregation before the LORD.

001:004 And he shall put his hand upon the head of the burnt offering;
        and it shall be accepted for him to make atonement for him.

001:005 And he shall kill the bullock before the LORD: and the
        priests, Aaron's sons, shall bring the blood, and sprinkle the
        blood round about upon the altar that is by the door of the
        tabernacle of the congregation.

001:006 And he shall flay the burnt offering, and cut it into his
        pieces.

001:007 And the sons of Aaron the priest shall put fire upon the
        altar, and lay the wood in order upon the fire:

001:008 And the priests, Aaron's sons, shall lay the parts, the head,
        and the fat, in order upon the wood that is on the fire which
        is upon the altar:

001:009 But his inwards and his legs shall he wash in water: and the
        priest shall burn all on the altar, to be a burnt sacrifice,
        an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.

001:010 And if his offering be of the flocks, namely, of the sheep, or
        of the goats, for a burnt sacrifice; he shall bring it a male
        without blemish.

001:011 And he shall kill it on the side of the altar northward before
        the LORD: and the priests, Aaron's sons, shall sprinkle his
        blood round about upon the altar.

001:012 And he shall cut it into his pieces, with his head and his
        fat: and the priest shall lay them in order on the wood that
        is on the fire which is upon the altar:

001:013 But he shall wash the inwards and the legs with water: and the
        priest shall bring it all, and burn it upon the altar: it is a
        burnt sacrifice, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour
        unto the LORD.

001:014 And if the burnt sacrifice for his offering to the LORD be of
        fowls, then he shall bring his offering of turtledoves, or of
        young pigeons.

001:015 And the priest shall bring it unto the altar, and wring off
        his head, and burn it on the altar; and the blood thereof
        shall be wrung out at the side of the altar:

001:016 And he shall pluck away his crop with his feathers, and cast
        it beside the altar on the east part, by the place of the
        ashes:

001:017 And he shall cleave it with the wings thereof, but shall not
        divide it asunder: and the priest shall burn it upon the
        altar, upon the wood that is upon the fire: it is a burnt
        sacrifice, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto
        the LORD.

002:001 And when any will offer a meat offering unto the LORD, his
        offering shall be of fine flour; and he shall pour oil upon
        it, and put frankincense thereon:

002:002 And he shall bring it to Aaron's sons the priests: and he
        shall take thereout his handful of the flour thereof, and of
        the oil thereof, with all the frankincense thereof; and the
        priest shall burn the memorial of it upon the altar, to be an
        offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD:

002:003 And the remnant of the meat offering shall be Aaron's and his
        sons': it is a thing most holy of the offerings of the LORD
        made by fire.

002:004 And if thou bring an oblation of a meat offering baken in the
        oven, it shall be unleavened cakes of fine flour mingled with
        oil, or unleavened wafers anointed with oil.

002:005 And if thy oblation be a meat offering baken in a pan, it
        shall be of fine flour unleavened, mingled with oil.

002:006 Thou shalt part it in pieces, and pour oil thereon: it is a
        meat offering.

002:007 And if thy oblation be a meat offering baken in the fryingpan,
        it shall be made of fine flour with oil.

002:008 And thou shalt bring the meat offering that is made of these
        things unto the LORD: and when it is presented unto the
        priest, he shall bring it unto the altar.

002:009 And the priest shall take from the meat offering a memorial
        thereof, and shall burn it upon the altar: it is an offering
        made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.

002:010 And that which is left of the meat offering shall be Aaron's
        and his sons': it is a thing most holy of the offerings of the
        LORD made by fire.

002:011 No meat offering, which ye shall bring unto the LORD, shall be
        made with leaven: for ye shall burn no leaven, nor any honey,
        in any offering of the LORD made by fire.

002:012 As for the oblation of the firstfruits, ye shall offer them
        unto the LORD: but they shall not be burnt on the altar for a
        sweet savour.

002:013 And every oblation of thy meat offering shalt thou season with
        salt; neither shalt thou suffer the salt of the covenant of
        thy God to be lacking from thy meat offering: with all thine
        offerings thou shalt offer salt.

002:014 And if thou offer a meat offering of thy firstfruits unto the
        LORD, thou shalt offer for the meat offering of thy
        firstfruits green ears of corn dried by the fire, even corn
        beaten out of full ears.

002:015 And thou shalt put oil upon it, and lay frankincense thereon:
        it is a meat offering.

002:016 And the priest shall burn the memorial of it, part of the
        beaten corn thereof, and part of the oil thereof, with all the
        frankincense thereof: it is an offering made by fire unto the
        LORD.

003:001 And if his oblation be a sacrifice of peace offering, if he
        offer it of the herd; whether it be a male or female, he shall
        offer it without blemish before the LORD.

003:002 And he shall lay his hand upon the head of his offering, and
        kill it at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation: and
        Aaron's sons the priests shall sprinkle the blood upon the
        altar round about.

003:003 And he shall offer of the sacrifice of the peace offering an
        offering made by fire unto the LORD; the fat that covereth the
        inwards, and all the fat that is upon the inwards,

003:004 And the two kidneys, and the fat that is on them, which is by
        the flanks, and the caul above the liver, with the kidneys, it
        shall he take away.

003:005 And Aaron's sons shall burn it on the altar upon the burnt
        sacrifice, which is upon the wood that is on the fire: it is
        an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.

003:006 And if his offering for a sacrifice of peace offering unto the
        LORD be of the flock; male or female, he shall offer it
        without blemish.

003:007 If he offer a lamb for his offering, then shall he offer it
        before the LORD.

003:008 And he shall lay his hand upon the head of his offering, and
        kill it before the tabernacle of the congregation: and Aaron's
        sons shall sprinkle the blood thereof round about upon the
        altar.

003:009 And he shall offer of the sacrifice of the peace offering an
        offering made by fire unto the LORD; the fat thereof, and the
        whole rump, it shall he take off hard by the backbone; and the
        fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat that is upon
        the inwards,

003:010 And the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, which is
        by the flanks, and the caul above the liver, with the kidneys,
        it shall he take away.

003:011 And the priest shall burn it upon the altar: it is the food of
        the offering made by fire unto the LORD.

003:012 And if his offering be a goat, then he shall offer it before
        the LORD.

003:013 And he shall lay his hand upon the head of it, and kill it
        before the tabernacle of the congregation: and the sons of
        Aaron shall sprinkle the blood thereof upon the altar round
        about.

003:014 And he shall offer thereof his offering, even an offering made
        by fire unto the LORD; the fat that covereth the inwards, and
        all the fat that is upon the inwards,

003:015 And the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, which is
        by the flanks, and the caul above the liver, with the kidneys,
        it shall he take away.

003:016 And the priest shall burn them upon the altar: it is the food
        of the offering made by fire for a sweet savour: all the fat
        is the LORD's.

003:017 It shall be a perpetual statute for your generations
        throughout all your dwellings, that ye eat neither fat nor
        blood.

004:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

004:002 Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If a soul shall sin
        through ignorance against any of the commandments of the LORD
        concerning things which ought not to be done, and shall do
        against any of them:

004:003 If the priest that is anointed do sin according to the sin of
        the people; then let him bring for his sin, which he hath
        sinned, a young bullock without blemish unto the LORD for a
        sin offering.

004:004 And he shall bring the bullock unto the door of the tabernacle
        of the congregation before the LORD; and shall lay his hand
        upon the bullock's head, and kill the bullock before the LORD.

004:005 And the priest that is anointed shall take of the bullock's
        blood, and bring it to the tabernacle of the congregation:

004:006 And the priest shall dip his finger in the blood, and sprinkle
        of the blood seven times before the LORD, before the vail of
        the sanctuary.

004:007 And the priest shall put some of the blood upon the horns of
        the altar of sweet incense before the LORD, which is in the
        tabernacle of the congregation; and shall pour all the blood
        of the bullock at the bottom of the altar of the burnt
        offering, which is at the door of the tabernacle of the
        congregation.

004:008 And he shall take off from it all the fat of the bullock for
        the sin offering; the fat that covereth the inwards, and all
        the fat that is upon the inwards,

004:009 And the two kidneys, and the fat that is upon them, which is
        by the flanks, and the caul above the liver, with the kidneys,
        it shall he take away,

004:010 As it was taken off from the bullock of the sacrifice of peace
        offerings: and the priest shall burn them upon the altar of
        the burnt offering.

004:011 And the skin of the bullock, and all his flesh, with his head,
        and with his legs, and his inwards, and his dung,

004:012 Even the whole bullock shall he carry forth without the camp
        unto a clean place, where the ashes are poured out, and burn
        him on the wood with fire: where the ashes are poured out
        shall he be burnt.

004:013 And if the whole congregation of Israel sin through ignorance,
        and the thing be hid from the eyes of the assembly, and they
        have done somewhat against any of the commandments of the LORD
        concerning things which should not be done, and are guilty;

004:014 When the sin, which they have sinned against it, is known,
        then the congregation shall offer a young bullock for the sin,
        and bring him before the tabernacle of the congregation.

004:015 And the elders of the congregation shall lay their hands upon
        the head of the bullock before the LORD: and the bullock shall
        be killed before the LORD.

004:016 And the priest that is anointed shall bring of the bullock's
        blood to the tabernacle of the congregation:

004:017 And the priest shall dip his finger in some of the blood, and
        sprinkle it seven times before the LORD, even before the vail.

004:018 And he shall put some of the blood upon the horns of the altar
        which is before the LORD, that is in the tabernacle of the
        congregation, and shall pour out all the blood at the bottom
        of the altar of the burnt offering, which is at the door of
        the tabernacle of the congregation.

004:019 And he shall take all his fat from him, and burn it upon the
        altar.

004:020 And he shall do with the bullock as he did with the bullock
        for a sin offering, so shall he do with this: and the priest
        shall make an atonement for them, and it shall be forgiven
        them.

004:021 And he shall carry forth the bullock without the camp, and
        burn him as he burned the first bullock: it is a sin offering
        for the congregation.

004:022 When a ruler hath sinned, and done somewhat through ignorance
        against any of the commandments of the LORD his God concerning
        things which should not be done, and is guilty;

004:023 Or if his sin, wherein he hath sinned, come to his knowledge;
        he shall bring his offering, a kid of the goats, a male
        without blemish:

004:024 And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the goat, and kill
        it in the place where they kill the burnt offering before the
        LORD: it is a sin offering.

004:025 And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering
        with his finger, and put it upon the horns of the altar of
        burnt offering, and shall pour out his blood at the bottom of
        the altar of burnt offering.

004:026 And he shall burn all his fat upon the altar, as the fat of
        the sacrifice of peace offerings: and the priest shall make an
        atonement for him as concerning his sin, and it shall be
        forgiven him.

004:027 And if any one of the common people sin through ignorance,
        while he doeth somewhat against any of the commandments of the
        LORD concerning things which ought not to be done, and be
        guilty;

004:028 Or if his sin, which he hath sinned, come to his knowledge:
        then he shall bring his offering, a kid of the goats, a female
        without blemish, for his sin which he hath sinned.

004:029 And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the sin offering,
        and slay the sin offering in the place of the burnt offering.

004:030 And the priest shall take of the blood thereof with his
        finger, and put it upon the horns of the altar of burnt
        offering, and shall pour out all the blood thereof at the
        bottom of the altar.

004:031 And he shall take away all the fat thereof, as the fat is
        taken away from off the sacrifice of peace offerings; and the
        priest shall burn it upon the altar for a sweet savour unto
        the LORD; and the priest shall make an atonement for him, and
        it shall be forgiven him.

004:032 And if he bring a lamb for a sin offering, he shall bring it a
        female without blemish.

004:033 And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the sin offering,
        and slay it for a sin offering in the place where they kill
        the burnt offering.

004:034 And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering
        with his finger, and put it upon the horns of the altar of
        burnt offering, and shall pour out all the blood thereof at
        the bottom of the altar:

004:035 And he shall take away all the fat thereof, as the fat of the
        lamb is taken away from the sacrifice of the peace offerings;
        and the priest shall burn them upon the altar, according to
        the offerings made by fire unto the LORD: and the priest shall
        make an atonement for his sin that he hath committed, and it
        shall be forgiven him.

005:001 And if a soul sin, and hear the voice of swearing, and is a
        witness, whether he hath seen or known of it; if he do not
        utter it, then he shall bear his iniquity.

005:002 Or if a soul touch any unclean thing, whether it be a carcase
        of an unclean beast, or a carcase of unclean cattle, or the
        carcase of unclean creeping things, and if it be hidden from
        him; he also shall be unclean, and guilty.

005:003 Or if he touch the uncleanness of man, whatsoever uncleanness
        it be that a man shall be defiled withal, and it be hid from
        him; when he knoweth of it, then he shall be guilty.

005:004 Or if a soul swear, pronouncing with his lips to do evil, or
        to do good, whatsoever it be that a man shall pronounce with
        an oath, and it be hid from him; when he knoweth of it, then
        he shall be guilty in one of these.

005:005 And it shall be, when he shall be guilty in one of these
        things, that he shall confess that he hath sinned in that
        thing:

005:006 And he shall bring his trespass offering unto the LORD for his
        sin which he hath sinned, a female from the flock, a lamb or a
        kid of the goats, for a sin offering; and the priest shall
        make an atonement for him concerning his sin.

005:007 And if he be not able to bring a lamb, then he shall bring for
        his trespass, which he hath committed, two turtledoves, or two
        young pigeons, unto the LORD; one for a sin offering, and the
        other for a burnt offering.

005:008 And he shall bring them unto the priest, who shall offer that
        which is for the sin offering first, and wring off his head
        from his neck, but shall not divide it asunder:

005:009 And he shall sprinkle of the blood of the sin offering upon
        the side of the altar; and the rest of the blood shall be
        wrung out at the bottom of the altar: it is a sin offering.

005:010 And he shall offer the second for a burnt offering, according
        to the manner: and the priest shall make an atonement for him
        for his sin which he hath sinned, and it shall be forgiven
        him.

005:011 But if he be not able to bring two turtledoves, or two young
        pigeons, then he that sinned shall bring for his offering the
        tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a sin offering; he
        shall put no oil upon it, neither shall he put any
        frankincense thereon: for it is a sin offering.

005:012 Then shall he bring it to the priest, and the priest shall
        take his handful of it, even a memorial thereof, and burn it
        on the altar, according to the offerings made by fire unto the
        LORD: it is a sin offering.

005:013 And the priest shall make an atonement for him as touching his
        sin that he hath sinned in one of these, and it shall be
        forgiven him: and the remnant shall be the priest's, as a meat
        offering.

005:014 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

005:015 If a soul commit a trespass, and sin through ignorance, in the
        holy things of the LORD; then he shall bring for his trespass
        unto the LORD a ram without blemish out of the flocks, with
        thy estimation by shekels of silver, after the shekel of the
        sanctuary, for a trespass offering.

005:016 And he shall make amends for the harm that he hath done in the
        holy thing, and shall add the fifth part thereto, and give it
        unto the priest: and the priest shall make an atonement for
        him with the ram of the trespass offering, and it shall be
        forgiven him.

005:017 And if a soul sin, and commit any of these things which are
        forbidden to be done by the commandments of the LORD; though
        he wist it not, yet is he guilty, and shall bear his iniquity.

005:018 And he shall bring a ram without blemish out of the flock,
        with thy estimation, for a trespass offering, unto the priest:
        and the priest shall make an atonement for him concerning his
        ignorance wherein he erred and wist it not, and it shall be
        forgiven him.

005:019 It is a trespass offering: he hath certainly trespassed
        against the LORD.

006:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

006:002 If a soul sin, and commit a trespass against the LORD, and lie
        unto his neighbour in that which was delivered him to keep, or
        in fellowship, or in a thing taken away by violence, or hath
        deceived his neighbour;

006:003 Or have found that which was lost, and lieth concerning it,
        and sweareth falsely; in any of all these that a man doeth,
        sinning therein:

006:004 Then it shall be, because he hath sinned, and is guilty, that
        he shall restore that which he took violently away, or the
        thing which he hath deceitfully gotten, or that which was
        delivered him to keep, or the lost thing which he found,

006:005 Or all that about which he hath sworn falsely; he shall even
        restore it in the principal, and shall add the fifth part more
        thereto, and give it unto him to whom it appertaineth, in the
        day of his trespass offering.

006:006 And he shall bring his trespass offering unto the LORD, a ram
        without blemish out of the flock, with thy estimation, for a
        trespass offering, unto the priest:

006:007 And the priest shall make an atonement for him before the
        LORD: and it shall be forgiven him for any thing of all that
        he hath done in trespassing therein.

006:008 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

006:009 Command Aaron and his sons, saying, This is the law of the
        burnt offering: It is the burnt offering, because of the
        burning upon the altar all night unto the morning, and the
        fire of the altar shall be burning in it.

006:010 And the priest shall put on his linen garment, and his linen
        breeches shall he put upon his flesh, and take up the ashes
        which the fire hath consumed with the burnt offering on the
        altar, and he shall put them beside the altar.

006:011 And he shall put off his garments, and put on other garments,
        and carry forth the ashes without the camp unto a clean place.

006:012 And the fire upon the altar shall be burning in it; it shall
        not be put out: and the priest shall burn wood on it every
        morning, and lay the burnt offering in order upon it; and he
        shall burn thereon the fat of the peace offerings.

006:013 The fire shall ever be burning upon the altar; it shall never
        go out.

006:014 And this is the law of the meat offering: the sons of Aaron
        shall offer it before the LORD, before the altar.

006:015 And he shall take of it his handful, of the flour of the meat
        offering, and of the oil thereof, and all the frankincense
        which is upon the meat offering, and shall burn it upon the
        altar for a sweet savour, even the memorial of it, unto the
        LORD.

006:016 And the remainder thereof shall Aaron and his sons eat: with
        unleavened bread shall it be eaten in the holy place; in the
        court of the tabernacle of the congregation they shall eat it.

006:017 It shall not be baken with leaven. I have given it unto them
        for their portion of my offerings made by fire; it is most
        holy, as is the sin offering, and as the trespass offering.

006:018 All the males among the children of Aaron shall eat of it. It
        shall be a statute for ever in your generations concerning the
        offerings of the LORD made by fire: every one that toucheth
        them shall be holy.

006:019 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

006:020 This is the offering of Aaron and of his sons, which they
        shall offer unto the LORD in the day when he is anointed; the
        tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a meat offering
        perpetual, half of it in the morning, and half thereof at
        night.

006:021 In a pan it shall be made with oil; and when it is baken, thou
        shalt bring it in: and the baken pieces of the meat offering
        shalt thou offer for a sweet savour unto the LORD.

006:022 And the priest of his sons that is anointed in his stead shall
        offer it: it is a statute for ever unto the LORD; it shall be
        wholly burnt.

006:023 For every meat offering for the priest shall be wholly burnt:
        it shall not be eaten.

006:024 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

006:025 Speak unto Aaron and to his sons, saying, This is the law of
        the sin offering: In the place where the burnt offering is
        killed shall the sin offering be killed before the LORD: it is
        most holy.

006:026 The priest that offereth it for sin shall eat it: in the holy
        place shall it be eaten, in the court of the tabernacle of the
        congregation.

006:027 Whatsoever shall touch the flesh thereof shall be holy: and
        when there is sprinkled of the blood thereof upon any garment,
        thou shalt wash that whereon it was sprinkled in the holy
        place.

006:028 But the earthen vessel wherein it is sodden shall be broken:
        and if it be sodden in a brasen pot, it shall be both scoured,
        and rinsed in water.

006:029 All the males among the priests shall eat thereof: it is most
        holy.

006:030 And no sin offering, whereof any of the blood is brought into
        the tabernacle of the congregation to reconcile withal in the
        holy place, shall be eaten: it shall be burnt in the fire.

007:001 Likewise this is the law of the trespass offering: it is most
        holy.

007:002 In the place where they kill the burnt offering shall they
        kill the trespass offering: and the blood thereof shall he
        sprinkle round about upon the altar.

007:003 And he shall offer of it all the fat thereof; the rump, and
        the fat that covereth the inwards,

007:004 And the two kidneys, and the fat that is on them, which is by
        the flanks, and the caul that is above the liver, with the
        kidneys, it shall he take away:

007:005 And the priest shall burn them upon the altar for an offering
        made by fire unto the LORD: it is a trespass offering.

007:006 Every male among the priests shall eat thereof: it shall be
        eaten in the holy place: it is most holy.

007:007 As the sin offering is, so is the trespass offering: there is
        one law for them: the priest that maketh atonement therewith
        shall have it.

007:008 And the priest that offereth any man's burnt offering, even
        the priest shall have to himself the skin of the burnt
        offering which he hath offered.

007:009 And all the meat offering that is baken in the oven, and all
        that is dressed in the fryingpan, and in the pan, shall be the
        priest's that offereth it.

007:010 And every meat offering, mingled with oil, and dry, shall all
        the sons of Aaron have, one as much as another.

007:011 And this is the law of the sacrifice of peace offerings, which
        he shall offer unto the LORD.

007:012 If he offer it for a thanksgiving, then he shall offer with
        the sacrifice of thanksgiving unleavened cakes mingled with
        oil, and unleavened wafers anointed with oil, and cakes
        mingled with oil, of fine flour, fried.

007:013 Besides the cakes, he shall offer for his offering leavened
        bread with the sacrifice of thanksgiving of his peace
        offerings.

007:014 And of it he shall offer one out of the whole oblation for an
        heave offering unto the LORD, and it shall be the priest's
        that sprinkleth the blood of the peace offerings.

007:015 And the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings for
        thanksgiving shall be eaten the same day that it is offered;
        he shall not leave any of it until the morning.

007:016 But if the sacrifice of his offering be a vow, or a voluntary
        offering, it shall be eaten the same day that he offereth his
        sacrifice: and on the morrow also the remainder of it shall be
        eaten:

007:017 But the remainder of the flesh of the sacrifice on the third
        day shall be burnt with fire.

007:018 And if any of the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace
        offerings be eaten at all on the third day, it shall not be
        accepted, neither shall it be imputed unto him that offereth
        it: it shall be an abomination, and the soul that eateth of it
        shall bear his iniquity.

007:019 And the flesh that toucheth any unclean thing shall not be
        eaten; it shall be burnt with fire: and as for the flesh, all
        that be clean shall eat thereof.

007:020 But the soul that eateth of the flesh of the sacrifice of
        peace offerings, that pertain unto the LORD, having his
        uncleanness upon him, even that soul shall be cut off from his
        people.

007:021 Moreover the soul that shall touch any unclean thing, as the
        uncleanness of man, or any unclean beast, or any abominable
        unclean thing, and eat of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace
        offerings, which pertain unto the LORD, even that soul shall
        be cut off from his people.

007:022 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

007:023 Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, Ye shall eat no
        manner of fat, of ox, or of sheep, or of goat.

007:024 And the fat of the beast that dieth of itself, and the fat of
        that which is torn with beasts, may be used in any other use:
        but ye shall in no wise eat of it.

007:025 For whosoever eateth the fat of the beast, of which men offer
        an offering made by fire unto the LORD, even the soul that
        eateth it shall be cut off from his people.

007:026 Moreover ye shall eat no manner of blood, whether it be of
        fowl or of beast, in any of your dwellings.

007:027 Whatsoever soul it be that eateth any manner of blood, even
        that soul shall be cut off from his people.

007:028 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

007:029 Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, He that offereth
        the sacrifice of his peace offerings unto the LORD shall bring
        his oblation unto the LORD of the sacrifice of his peace
        offerings.

007:030 His own hands shall bring the offerings of the LORD made by
        fire, the fat with the breast, it shall he bring, that the
        breast may be waved for a wave offering before the LORD.

007:031 And the priest shall burn the fat upon the altar: but the
        breast shall be Aaron's and his sons'.

007:032 And the right shoulder shall ye give unto the priest for an
        heave offering of the sacrifices of your peace offerings.

007:033 He among the sons of Aaron, that offereth the blood of the
        peace offerings, and the fat, shall have the right shoulder
        for his part.

007:034 For the wave breast and the heave shoulder have I taken of the
        children of Israel from off the sacrifices of their peace
        offerings, and have given them unto Aaron the priest and unto
        his sons by a statute for ever from among the children of
        Israel.

007:035 This is the portion of the anointing of Aaron, and of the
        anointing of his sons, out of the offerings of the LORD made
        by fire, in the day when he presented them to minister unto
        the LORD in the priest's office;

007:036 Which the LORD commanded to be given them of the children of
        Israel, in the day that he anointed them, by a statute for
        ever throughout their generations.

007:037 This is the law of the burnt offering, of the meat offering,
        and of the sin offering, and of the trespass offering, and of
        the consecrations, and of the sacrifice of the peace
        offerings;

007:038 Which the LORD commanded Moses in mount Sinai, in the day that
        he commanded the children of Israel to offer their oblations
        unto the LORD, in the wilderness of Sinai.

008:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

008:002 Take Aaron and his sons with him, and the garments, and the
        anointing oil, and a bullock for the sin offering, and two
        rams, and a basket of unleavened bread;

008:003 And gather thou all the congregation together unto the door of
        the tabernacle of the congregation.

008:004 And Moses did as the LORD commanded him; and the assembly was
        gathered together unto the door of the tabernacle of the
        congregation.

008:005 And Moses said unto the congregation, This is the thing which
        the LORD commanded to be done.

008:006 And Moses brought Aaron and his sons, and washed them with
        water.

008:007 And he put upon him the coat, and girded him with the girdle,
        and clothed him with the robe, and put the ephod upon him, and
        he girded him with the curious girdle of the ephod, and bound
        it unto him therewith.

008:008 And he put the breastplate upon him: also he put in the
        breastplate the Urim and the Thummim.

008:009 And he put the mitre upon his head; also upon the mitre, even
        upon his forefront, did he put the golden plate, the holy
        crown; as the LORD commanded Moses.

008:010 And Moses took the anointing oil, and anointed the tabernacle
        and all that was therein, and sanctified them.

008:011 And he sprinkled thereof upon the altar seven times, and
        anointed the altar and all his vessels, both the laver and his
        foot, to sanctify them.

008:012 And he poured of the anointing oil upon Aaron's head, and
        anointed him, to sanctify him.

008:013 And Moses brought Aaron's sons, and put coats upon them, and
        girded them with girdles, and put bonnets upon them; as the
        LORD commanded Moses.

008:014 And he brought the bullock for the sin offering: and Aaron and
        his sons laid their hands upon the head of the bullock for the
        sin offering.

008:015 And he slew it; and Moses took the blood, and put it upon the
        horns of the altar round about with his finger, and purified
        the altar, and poured the blood at the bottom of the altar,
        and sanctified it, to make reconciliation upon it.

008:016 And he took all the fat that was upon the inwards, and the
        caul above the liver, and the two kidneys, and their fat, and
        Moses burned it upon the altar.

008:017 But the bullock, and his hide, his flesh, and his dung, he
        burnt with fire without the camp; as the LORD commanded Moses.

008:018 And he brought the ram for the burnt offering: and Aaron and
        his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram.

008:019 And he killed it; and Moses sprinkled the blood upon the altar
        round about.

008:020 And he cut the ram into pieces; and Moses burnt the head, and
        the pieces, and the fat.

008:021 And he washed the inwards and the legs in water; and Moses
        burnt the whole ram upon the altar: it was a burnt sacrifice
        for a sweet savour, and an offering made by fire unto the
        LORD; as the LORD commanded Moses.

008:022 And he brought the other ram, the ram of consecration: and
        Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram.

008:023 And he slew it; and Moses took of the blood of it, and put it
        upon the tip of Aaron's right ear, and upon the thumb of his
        right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot.

008:024 And he brought Aaron's sons, and Moses put of the blood upon
        the tip of their right ear, and upon the thumbs of their right
        hands, and upon the great toes of their right feet: and Moses
        sprinkled the blood upon the altar round about.

008:025 And he took the fat, and the rump, and all the fat that was
        upon the inwards, and the caul above the liver, and the two
        kidneys, and their fat, and the right shoulder:

008:026 And out of the basket of unleavened bread, that was before the
        LORD, he took one unleavened cake, and a cake of oiled bread,
        and one wafer, and put them on the fat, and upon the right
        shoulder:

008:027 And he put all upon Aaron's hands, and upon his sons' hands,
        and waved them for a wave offering before the LORD.

008:028 And Moses took them from off their hands, and burnt them on
        the altar upon the burnt offering: they were consecrations for
        a sweet savour: it is an offering made by fire unto the LORD.

008:029 And Moses took the breast, and waved it for a wave offering
        before the LORD: for of the ram of consecration it was Moses'
        part; as the LORD commanded Moses.

008:030 And Moses took of the anointing oil, and of the blood which
        was upon the altar, and sprinkled it upon Aaron, and upon his
        garments, and upon his sons, and upon his sons' garments with
        him; and sanctified Aaron, and his garments, and his sons, and
        his sons' garments with him.

008:031 And Moses said unto Aaron and to his sons, Boil the flesh at
        the door of the tabernacle of the congregation: and there eat
        it with the bread that is in the basket of consecrations, as I
        commanded, saying, Aaron and his sons shall eat it.

008:032 And that which remaineth of the flesh and of the bread shall
        ye burn with fire.

008:033 And ye shall not go out of the door of the tabernacle of the
        congregation in seven days, until the days of your
        consecration be at an end: for seven days shall he consecrate
        you.

008:034 As he hath done this day, so the LORD hath commanded to do, to
        make an atonement for you.

008:035 Therefore shall ye abide at the door of the tabernacle of the
        congregation day and night seven days, and keep the charge of
        the LORD, that ye die not: for so I am commanded.

008:036 So Aaron and his sons did all things which the LORD commanded
        by the hand of Moses.

009:001 And it came to pass on the eighth day, that Moses called Aaron
        and his sons, and the elders of Israel;

009:002 And he said unto Aaron, Take thee a young calf for a sin
        offering, and a ram for a burnt offering, without blemish, and
        offer them before the LORD.

009:003 And unto the children of Israel thou shalt speak, saying, Take
        ye a kid of the goats for a sin offering; and a calf and a
        lamb, both of the first year, without blemish, for a burnt
        offering;

009:004 Also a bullock and a ram for peace offerings, to sacrifice
        before the LORD; and a meat offering mingled with oil: for to
        day the LORD will appear unto you.

009:005 And they brought that which Moses commanded before the
        tabernacle of the congregation: and all the congregation drew
        near and stood before the LORD.

009:006 And Moses said, This is the thing which the LORD commanded
        that ye should do: and the glory of the LORD shall appear unto
        you.

009:007 And Moses said unto Aaron, Go unto the altar, and offer thy
        sin offering, and thy burnt offering, and make an atonement
        for thyself, and for the people: and offer the offering of the
        people, and make an atonement for them; as the LORD commanded.

009:008 Aaron therefore went unto the altar, and slew the calf of the
        sin offering, which was for himself.

009:009 And the sons of Aaron brought the blood unto him: and he
        dipped his finger in the blood, and put it upon the horns of
        the altar, and poured out the blood at the bottom of the
        altar:

009:010 But the fat, and the kidneys, and the caul above the liver of
        the sin offering, he burnt upon the altar; as the LORD
        commanded Moses.

009:011 And the flesh and the hide he burnt with fire without the
        camp.

009:012 And he slew the burnt offering; and Aaron's sons presented
        unto him the blood, which he sprinkled round about upon the
        altar.

009:013 And they presented the burnt offering unto him, with the
        pieces thereof, and the head: and he burnt them upon the
        altar.

009:014 And he did wash the inwards and the legs, and burnt them upon
        the burnt offering on the altar.

009:015 And he brought the people's offering, and took the goat, which
        was the sin offering for the people, and slew it, and offered
        it for sin, as the first.

009:016 And he brought the burnt offering, and offered it according to
        the manner.

009:017 And he brought the meat offering, and took an handful thereof,
        and burnt it upon the altar, beside the burnt sacrifice of the
        morning.

009:018 He slew also the bullock and the ram for a sacrifice of peace
        offerings, which was for the people: and Aaron's sons
        presented unto him the blood, which he sprinkled upon the
        altar round about,

009:019 And the fat of the bullock and of the ram, the rump, and that
        which covereth the inwards, and the kidneys, and the caul
        above the liver:

009:020 And they put the fat upon the breasts, and he burnt the fat
        upon the altar:

009:021 And the breasts and the right shoulder Aaron waved for a wave
        offering before the LORD; as Moses commanded.

009:022 And Aaron lifted up his hand toward the people, and blessed
        them, and came down from offering of the sin offering, and the
        burnt offering, and peace offerings.

009:023 And Moses and Aaron went into the tabernacle of the
        congregation, and came out, and blessed the people: and the
        glory of the LORD appeared unto all the people.

009:024 And there came a fire out from before the LORD, and consumed
        upon the altar the burnt offering and the fat: which when all
        the people saw, they shouted, and fell on their faces.

010:001 And Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, took either of them
        his censer, and put fire therein, and put incense thereon, and
        offered strange fire before the LORD, which he commanded them
        not.

010:002 And there went out fire from the LORD, and devoured them, and
        they died before the LORD.

010:003 Then Moses said unto Aaron, This is it that the LORD spake,
        saying, I will be sanctified in them that come nigh me, and
        before all the people I will be glorified. And Aaron held his
        peace.

010:004 And Moses called Mishael and Elzaphan, the sons of Uzziel the
        uncle of Aaron, and said unto them, Come near, carry your
        brethren from before the sanctuary out of the camp.

010:005 So they went near, and carried them in their coats out of the
        camp; as Moses had said.

010:006 And Moses said unto Aaron, and unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar,
        his sons, Uncover not your heads, neither rend your clothes;
        lest ye die, and lest wrath come upon all the people: but let
        your brethren, the whole house of Israel, bewail the burning
        which the LORD hath kindled.

010:007 And ye shall not go out from the door of the tabernacle of the
        congregation, lest ye die: for the anointing oil of the LORD
        is upon you. And they did according to the word of Moses.

010:008 And the LORD spake unto Aaron, saying,

010:009 Do not drink wine nor strong drink, thou, nor thy sons with
        thee, when ye go into the tabernacle of the congregation, lest
        ye die: it shall be a statute for ever throughout your
        generations:

010:010 And that ye may put difference between holy and unholy, and
        between unclean and clean;

010:011 And that ye may teach the children of Israel all the statutes
        which the LORD hath spoken unto them by the hand of Moses.

010:012 And Moses spake unto Aaron, and unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar,
        his sons that were left, Take the meat offering that remaineth
        of the offerings of the LORD made by fire, and eat it without
        leaven beside the altar: for it is most holy:

010:013 And ye shall eat it in the holy place, because it is thy due,
        and thy sons' due, of the sacrifices of the LORD made by fire:
        for so I am commanded.

010:014 And the wave breast and heave shoulder shall ye eat in a clean
        place; thou, and thy sons, and thy daughters with thee: for
        they be thy due, and thy sons' due, which are given out of the
        sacrifices of peace offerings of the children of Israel.

010:015 The heave shoulder and the wave breast shall they bring with
        the offerings made by fire of the fat, to wave it for a wave
        offering before the LORD; and it shall be thine, and thy sons'
        with thee, by a statute for ever; as the LORD hath commanded.

010:016 And Moses diligently sought the goat of the sin offering, and,
        behold, it was burnt: and he was angry with Eleazar and
        Ithamar, the sons of Aaron which were left alive, saying,

010:017 Wherefore have ye not eaten the sin offering in the holy
        place, seeing it is most holy, and God hath given it you to
        bear the iniquity of the congregation, to make atonement for
        them before the LORD?

010:018 Behold, the blood of it was not brought in within the holy
        place: ye should indeed have eaten it in the holy place, as I
        commanded.

010:019 And Aaron said unto Moses, Behold, this day have they offered
        their sin offering and their burnt offering before the LORD;
        and such things have befallen me: and if I had eaten the sin
        offering to day, should it have been accepted in the sight of
        the LORD?

010:020 And when Moses heard that, he was content.

011:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses and to Aaron, saying unto them,

011:002 Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, These are the
        beasts which ye shall eat among all the beasts that are on the
        earth.

011:003 Whatsoever parteth the hoof, and is clovenfooted, and cheweth
        the cud, among the beasts, that shall ye eat.

011:004 Nevertheless these shall ye not eat of them that chew the cud,
        or of them that divide the hoof: as the camel, because he
        cheweth the cud, but divideth not the hoof; he is unclean unto
        you.

011:005 And the coney, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not
        the hoof; he is unclean unto you.

011:006 And the hare, because he cheweth the cud, but divideth not the
        hoof; he is unclean unto you.

011:007 And the swine, though he divide the hoof, and be clovenfooted,
        yet he cheweth not the cud; he is unclean to you.

011:008 Of their flesh shall ye not eat, and their carcase shall ye
        not touch; they are unclean to you.

011:009 These shall ye eat of all that are in the waters: whatsoever
        hath fins and scales in the waters, in the seas, and in the
        rivers, them shall ye eat.

011:010 And all that have not fins and scales in the seas, and in the
        rivers, of all that move in the waters, and of any living
        thing which is in the waters, they shall be an abomination
        unto you:

011:011 They shall be even an abomination unto you; ye shall not eat
        of their flesh, but ye shall have their carcases in
        abomination.

011:012 Whatsoever hath no fins nor scales in the waters, that shall
        be an abomination unto you.

011:013 And these are they which ye shall have in abomination among
        the fowls; they shall not be eaten, they are an abomination:
        the eagle, and the ossifrage, and the ospray,

011:014 And the vulture, and the kite after his kind;

011:015 Every raven after his kind;

011:016 And the owl, and the night hawk, and the cuckow, and the hawk
        after his kind,

011:017 And the little owl, and the cormorant, and the great owl,

011:018 And the swan, and the pelican, and the gier eagle,

011:019 And the stork, the heron after her kind, and the lapwing, and
        the bat.

011:020 All fowls that creep, going upon all four, shall be an
        abomination unto you.

011:021 Yet these may ye eat of every flying creeping thing that goeth
        upon all four, which have legs above their feet, to leap
        withal upon the earth;

011:022 Even these of them ye may eat; the locust after his kind, and
        the bald locust after his kind, and the beetle after his kind,
        and the grasshopper after his kind.

011:023 But all other flying creeping things, which have four feet,
        shall be an abomination unto you.

011:024 And for these ye shall be unclean: whosoever toucheth the
        carcase of them shall be unclean until the even.

011:025 And whosoever beareth ought of the carcase of them shall wash
        his clothes, and be unclean until the even.

011:026 The carcases of every beast which divideth the hoof, and is
        not clovenfooted, nor cheweth the cud, are unclean unto you:
        every one that toucheth them shall be unclean.

011:027 And whatsoever goeth upon his paws, among all manner of beasts
        that go on all four, those are unclean unto you: whoso
        toucheth their carcase shall be unclean until the even.

011:028 And he that beareth the carcase of them shall wash his
        clothes, and be unclean until the even: they are unclean unto
        you.

011:029 These also shall be unclean unto you among the creeping things
        that creep upon the earth; the weasel, and the mouse, and the
        tortoise after his kind,

011:030 And the ferret, and the chameleon, and the lizard, and the
        snail, and the mole.

011:031 These are unclean to you among all that creep: whosoever doth
        touch them, when they be dead, shall be unclean until the
        even.

011:032 And upon whatsoever any of them, when they are dead, doth
        fall, it shall be unclean; whether it be any vessel of wood,
        or raiment, or skin, or sack, whatsoever vessel it be, wherein
        any work is done, it must be put into water, and it shall be
        unclean until the even; so it shall be cleansed.

011:033 And every earthen vessel, whereinto any of them falleth,
        whatsoever is in it shall be unclean; and ye shall break it.

011:034 Of all meat which may be eaten, that on which such water
        cometh shall be unclean: and all drink that may be drunk in
        every such vessel shall be unclean.

011:035 And every thing whereupon any part of their carcase falleth
        shall be unclean; whether it be oven, or ranges for pots, they
        shall be broken down: for they are unclean and shall be
        unclean unto you.

011:036 Nevertheless a fountain or pit, wherein there is plenty of
        water, shall be clean: but that which toucheth their carcase
        shall be unclean.

011:037 And if any part of their carcase fall upon any sowing seed
        which is to be sown, it shall be clean.

011:038 But if any water be put upon the seed, and any part of their
        carcase fall thereon, it shall be unclean unto you.

011:039 And if any beast, of which ye may eat, die; he that toucheth
        the carcase thereof shall be unclean until the even.

011:040 And he that eateth of the carcase of it shall wash his
        clothes, and be unclean until the even: he also that beareth
        the carcase of it shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until
        the even.

011:041 And every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth shall be
        an abomination; it shall not be eaten.

011:042 Whatsoever goeth upon the belly, and whatsoever goeth upon all
        four, or whatsoever hath more feet among all creeping things
        that creep upon the earth, them ye shall not eat; for they are
        an abomination.

011:043 Ye shall not make yourselves abominable with any creeping
        thing that creepeth, neither shall ye make yourselves unclean
        with them, that ye should be defiled thereby.

011:044 For I am the LORD your God: ye shall therefore sanctify
        yourselves, and ye shall be holy; for I am holy: neither shall
        ye defile yourselves with any manner of creeping thing that
        creepeth upon the earth.

011:045 For I am the LORD that bringeth you up out of the land of
        Egypt, to be your God: ye shall therefore be holy, for I am
        holy.

011:046 This is the law of the beasts, and of the fowl, and of every
        living creature that moveth in the waters, and of every
        creature that creepeth upon the earth:

011:047 To make a difference between the unclean and the clean, and
        between the beast that may be eaten and the beast that may not
        be eaten.

012:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

012:002 Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If a woman have
        conceived seed, and born a man child: then she shall be
        unclean seven days; according to the days of the separation
        for her infirmity shall she be unclean.

012:003 And in the eighth day the flesh of his foreskin shall be
        circumcised.

012:004 And she shall then continue in the blood of her purifying
        three and thirty days; she shall touch no hallowed thing, nor
        come into the sanctuary, until the days of her purifying be
        fulfilled.

012:005 But if she bear a maid child, then she shall be unclean two
        weeks, as in her separation: and she shall continue in the
        blood of her purifying threescore and six days.

012:006 And when the days of her purifying are fulfilled, for a son,
        or for a daughter, she shall bring a lamb of the first year
        for a burnt offering, and a young pigeon, or a turtledove, for
        a sin offering, unto the door of the tabernacle of the
        congregation, unto the priest:

012:007 Who shall offer it before the LORD, and make an atonement for
        her; and she shall be cleansed from the issue of her blood.
        This is the law for her that hath born a male or a female.

012:008 And if she be not able to bring a lamb, then she shall bring
        two turtles, or two young pigeons; the one for the burnt
        offering, and the other for a sin offering: and the priest
        shall make an atonement for her, and she shall be clean.

013:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron, saying,

013:002 When a man shall have in the skin of his flesh a rising, a
        scab, or bright spot, and it be in the skin of his flesh like
        the plague of leprosy; then he shall be brought unto Aaron the
        priest, or unto one of his sons the priests:

013:003 And the priest shall look on the plague in the skin of the
        flesh: and when the hair in the plague is turned white, and
        the plague in sight be deeper than the skin of his flesh, it
        is a plague of leprosy: and the priest shall look on him, and
        pronounce him unclean.

013:004 If the bright spot be white in the skin of his flesh, and in
        sight be not deeper than the skin, and the hair thereof be not
        turned white; then the priest shall shut up him that hath the
        plague seven days:

013:005 And the priest shall look on him the seventh day: and, behold,
        if the plague in his sight be at a stay, and the plague spread
        not in the skin; then the priest shall shut him up seven days
        more:

013:006 And the priest shall look on him again the seventh day: and,
        behold, if the plague be somewhat dark, and the plague spread
        not in the skin, the priest shall pronounce him clean: it is
        but a scab: and he shall wash his clothes, and be clean.

013:007 But if the scab spread much abroad in the skin, after that he
        hath been seen of the priest for his cleansing, he shall be
        seen of the priest again.

013:008 And if the priest see that, behold, the scab spreadeth in the
        skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is a
        leprosy.

013:009 When the plague of leprosy is in a man, then he shall be
        brought unto the priest;

013:010 And the priest shall see him: and, behold, if the rising be
        white in the skin, and it have turned the hair white, and
        there be quick raw flesh in the rising;

013:011 It is an old leprosy in the skin of his flesh, and the priest
        shall pronounce him unclean, and shall not shut him up: for he
        is unclean.

013:012 And if a leprosy break out abroad in the skin, and the leprosy
        cover all the skin of him that hath the plague from his head
        even to his foot, wheresoever the priest looketh;

013:013 Then the priest shall consider: and, behold, if the leprosy
        have covered all his flesh, he shall pronounce him clean that
        hath the plague: it is all turned white: he is clean.

013:014 But when raw flesh appeareth in him, he shall be unclean.

013:015 And the priest shall see the raw flesh, and pronounce him to
        be unclean: for the raw flesh is unclean: it is a leprosy.

013:016 Or if the raw flesh turn again, and be changed unto white, he
        shall come unto the priest;

013:017 And the priest shall see him: and, behold, if the plague be
        turned into white; then the priest shall pronounce him clean
        that hath the plague: he is clean.

013:018 The flesh also, in which, even in the skin thereof, was a
        boil, and is healed,

013:019 And in the place of the boil there be a white rising, or a
        bright spot, white, and somewhat reddish, and it be shewed to
        the priest;

013:020 And if, when the priest seeth it, behold, it be in sight lower
        than the skin, and the hair thereof be turned white; the
        priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is a plague of leprosy
        broken out of the boil.

013:021 But if the priest look on it, and, behold, there be no white
        hairs therein, and if it be not lower than the skin, but be
        somewhat dark; then the priest shall shut him up seven days:

013:022 And if it spread much abroad in the skin, then the priest
        shall pronounce him unclean: it is a plague.

013:023 But if the bright spot stay in his place, and spread not, it
        is a burning boil; and the priest shall pronounce him clean.

013:024 Or if there be any flesh, in the skin whereof there is a hot
        burning, and the quick flesh that burneth have a white bright
        spot, somewhat reddish, or white;

013:025 Then the priest shall look upon it: and, behold, if the hair
        in the bright spot be turned white, and it be in sight deeper
        than the skin; it is a leprosy broken out of the burning:
        wherefore the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is the
        plague of leprosy.

013:026 But if the priest look on it, and, behold, there be no white
        hair in the bright spot, and it be no lower than the other
        skin, but be somewhat dark; then the priest shall shut him up
        seven days:

013:027 And the priest shall look upon him the seventh day: and if it
        be spread much abroad in the skin, then the priest shall
        pronounce him unclean: it is the plague of leprosy.

013:028 And if the bright spot stay in his place, and spread not in
        the skin, but it be somewhat dark; it is a rising of the
        burning, and the priest shall pronounce him clean: for it is
        an inflammation of the burning.

013:029 If a man or woman have a plague upon the head or the beard;

013:030 Then the priest shall see the plague: and, behold, if it be in
        sight deeper than the skin; and there be in it a yellow thin
        hair; then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it is a dry
        scall, even a leprosy upon the head or beard.

013:031 And if the priest look on the plague of the scall, and,
        behold, it be not in sight deeper than the skin, and that
        there is no black hair in it; then the priest shall shut up
        him that hath the plague of the scall seven days:

013:032 And in the seventh day the priest shall look on the plague:
        and, behold, if the scall spread not, and there be in it no
        yellow hair, and the scall be not in sight deeper than the
        skin;

013:033 He shall be shaven, but the scall shall he not shave; and the
        priest shall shut up him that hath the scall seven days more:

013:034 And in the seventh day the priest shall look on the scall:
        and, behold, if the scall be not spread in the skin, nor be in
        sight deeper than the skin; then the priest shall pronounce
        him clean: and he shall wash his clothes, and be clean.

013:035 But if the scall spread much in the skin after his cleansing;

013:036 Then the priest shall look on him: and, behold, if the scall
        be spread in the skin, the priest shall not seek for yellow
        hair; he is unclean.

013:037 But if the scall be in his sight at a stay, and that there is
        black hair grown up therein; the scall is healed, he is clean:
        and the priest shall pronounce him clean.

013:038 If a man also or a woman have in the skin of their flesh
        bright spots, even white bright spots;

013:039 Then the priest shall look: and, behold, if the bright spots
        in the skin of their flesh be darkish white; it is a freckled
        spot that groweth in the skin; he is clean.

013:040 And the man whose hair is fallen off his head, he is bald; yet
        is he clean.

013:041 And he that hath his hair fallen off from the part of his head
        toward his face, he is forehead bald: yet is he clean.

013:042 And if there be in the bald head, or bald forehead, a white
        reddish sore; it is a leprosy sprung up in his bald head, or
        his bald forehead.

013:043 Then the priest shall look upon it: and, behold, if the rising
        of the sore be white reddish in his bald head, or in his bald
        forehead, as the leprosy appeareth in the skin of the flesh;

013:044 He is a leprous man, he is unclean: the priest shall pronounce
        him utterly unclean; his plague is in his head.

013:045 And the leper in whom the plague is, his clothes shall be
        rent, and his head bare, and he shall put a covering upon his
        upper lip, and shall cry, Unclean, unclean.

013:046 All the days wherein the plague shall be in him he shall be
        defiled; he is unclean: he shall dwell alone; without the camp
        shall his habitation be.

013:047 The garment also that the plague of leprosy is in, whether it
        be a woollen garment, or a linen garment;

013:048 Whether it be in the warp, or woof; of linen, or of woollen;
        whether in a skin, or in any thing made of skin;

013:049 And if the plague be greenish or reddish in the garment, or in
        the skin, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in any thing
        of skin; it is a plague of leprosy, and shall be shewed unto
        the priest:

013:050 And the priest shall look upon the plague, and shut up it that
        hath the plague seven days:

013:051 And he shall look on the plague on the seventh day: if the
        plague be spread in the garment, either in the warp, or in the
        woof, or in a skin, or in any work that is made of skin; the
        plague is a fretting leprosy; it is unclean.

013:052 He shall therefore burn that garment, whether warp or woof, in
        woollen or in linen, or any thing of skin, wherein the plague
        is: for it is a fretting leprosy; it shall be burnt in the
        fire.

013:053 And if the priest shall look, and, behold, the plague be not
        spread in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or
        in any thing of skin;

013:054 Then the priest shall command that they wash the thing wherein
        the plague is, and he shall shut it up seven days more:

013:055 And the priest shall look on the plague, after that it is
        washed: and, behold, if the plague have not changed his
        colour, and the plague be not spread; it is unclean; thou
        shalt burn it in the fire; it is fret inward, whether it be
        bare within or without.

013:056 And if the priest look, and, behold, the plague be somewhat
        dark after the washing of it; then he shall rend it out of the
        garment, or out of the skin, or out of the warp, or out of the
        woof:

013:057 And if it appear still in the garment, either in the warp, or
        in the woof, or in any thing of skin; it is a spreading
        plague: thou shalt burn that wherein the plague is with fire.

013:058 And the garment, either warp, or woof, or whatsoever thing of
        skin it be, which thou shalt wash, if the plague be departed
        from them, then it shall be washed the second time, and shall
        be clean.

013:059 This is the law of the plague of leprosy in a garment of
        woollen or linen, either in the warp, or woof, or any thing of
        skins, to pronounce it clean, or to pronounce it unclean.

014:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

014:002 This shall be the law of the leper in the day of his
        cleansing: He shall be brought unto the priest:

014:003 And the priest shall go forth out of the camp; and the priest
        shall look, and, behold, if the plague of leprosy be healed in
        the leper;

014:004 Then shall the priest command to take for him that is to be
        cleansed two birds alive and clean, and cedar wood, and
        scarlet, and hyssop:

014:005 And the priest shall command that one of the birds be killed
        in an earthen vessel over running water:

014:006 As for the living bird, he shall take it, and the cedar wood,
        and the scarlet, and the hyssop, and shall dip them and the
        living bird in the blood of the bird that was killed over the
        running water:

014:007 And he shall sprinkle upon him that is to be cleansed from the
        leprosy seven times, and shall pronounce him clean, and shall
        let the living bird loose into the open field.

014:008 And he that is to be cleansed shall wash his clothes, and
        shave off all his hair, and wash himself in water, that he may
        be clean: and after that he shall come into the camp, and
        shall tarry abroad out of his tent seven days.

014:009 But it shall be on the seventh day, that he shall shave all
        his hair off his head and his beard and his eyebrows, even all
        his hair he shall shave off: and he shall wash his clothes,
        also he shall wash his flesh in water, and he shall be clean.

014:010 And on the eighth day he shall take two he lambs without
        blemish, and one ewe lamb of the first year without blemish,
        and three tenth deals of fine flour for a meat offering,
        mingled with oil, and one log of oil.

014:011 And the priest that maketh him clean shall present the man
        that is to be made clean, and those things, before the LORD,
        at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation:

014:012 And the priest shall take one he lamb, and offer him for a
        trespass offering, and the log of oil, and wave them for a
        wave offering before the LORD:

014:013 And he shall slay the lamb in the place where he shall kill
        the sin offering and the burnt offering, in the holy place:
        for as the sin offering is the priest's, so is the trespass
        offering: it is most holy:

014:014 And the priest shall take some of the blood of the trespass
        offering, and the priest shall put it upon the tip of the
        right ear of him that is to be cleansed, and upon the thumb of
        his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot:

014:015 And the priest shall take some of the log of oil, and pour it
        into the palm of his own left hand:

014:016 And the priest shall dip his right finger in the oil that is
        in his left hand, and shall sprinkle of the oil with his
        finger seven times before the LORD:

014:017 And of the rest of the oil that is in his hand shall the
        priest put upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be
        cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the
        great toe of his right foot, upon the blood of the trespass
        offering:

014:018 And the remnant of the oil that is in the priest's hand he
        shall pour upon the head of him that is to be cleansed: and
        the priest shall make an atonement for him before the LORD.

014:019 And the priest shall offer the sin offering, and make an
        atonement for him that is to be cleansed from his uncleanness;
        and afterward he shall kill the burnt offering:

014:020 And the priest shall offer the burnt offering and the meat
        offering upon the altar: and the priest shall make an
        atonement for him, and he shall be clean.

014:021 And if he be poor, and cannot get so much; then he shall take
        one lamb for a trespass offering to be waved, to make an
        atonement for him, and one tenth deal of fine flour mingled
        with oil for a meat offering, and a log of oil;

014:022 And two turtledoves, or two young pigeons, such as he is able
        to get; and the one shall be a sin offering, and the other a
        burnt offering.

014:023 And he shall bring them on the eighth day for his cleansing
        unto the priest, unto the door of the tabernacle of the
        congregation, before the LORD.

014:024 And the priest shall take the lamb of the trespass offering,
        and the log of oil, and the priest shall wave them for a wave
        offering before the LORD:

014:025 And he shall kill the lamb of the trespass offering, and the
        priest shall take some of the blood of the trespass offering,
        and put it upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be
        cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the
        great toe of his right foot:

014:026 And the priest shall pour of the oil into the palm of his own
        left hand:

014:027 And the priest shall sprinkle with his right finger some of
        the oil that is in his left hand seven times before the LORD:

014:028 And the priest shall put of the oil that is in his hand upon
        the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed, and
        upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of
        his right foot, upon the place of the blood of the trespass
        offering:

014:029 And the rest of the oil that is in the priest's hand he shall
        put upon the head of him that is to be cleansed, to make an
        atonement for him before the LORD.

014:030 And he shall offer the one of the turtledoves, or of the young
        pigeons, such as he can get;

014:031 Even such as he is able to get, the one for a sin offering,
        and the other for a burnt offering, with the meat offering:
        and the priest shall make an atonement for him that is to be
        cleansed before the LORD.

014:032 This is the law of him in whom is the plague of leprosy, whose
        hand is not able to get that which pertaineth to his
        cleansing.

014:033 And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,

014:034 When ye be come into the land of Canaan, which I give to you
        for a possession, and I put the plague of leprosy in a house
        of the land of your possession;

014:035 And he that owneth the house shall come and tell the priest,
        saying, It seemeth to me there is as it were a plague in the
        house:

014:036 Then the priest shall command that they empty the house,
        before the priest go into it to see the plague, that all that
        is in the house be not made unclean: and afterward the priest
        shall go in to see the house:

014:037 And he shall look on the plague, and, behold, if the plague be
        in the walls of the house with hollow strakes, greenish or
        reddish, which in sight are lower than the wall;

014:038 Then the priest shall go out of the house to the door of the
        house, and shut up the house seven days:

014:039 And the priest shall come again the seventh day, and shall
        look: and, behold, if the plague be spread in the walls of the
        house;

014:040 Then the priest shall command that they take away the stones
        in which the plague is, and they shall cast them into an
        unclean place without the city:

014:041 And he shall cause the house to be scraped within round about,
        and they shall pour out the dust that they scrape off without
        the city into an unclean place:

014:042 And they shall take other stones, and put them in the place of
        those stones; and he shall take other morter, and shall
        plaister the house.

014:043 And if the plague come again, and break out in the house,
        after that he hath taken away the stones, and after he hath
        scraped the house, and after it is plaistered;

014:044 Then the priest shall come and look, and, behold, if the
        plague be spread in the house, it is a fretting leprosy in the
        house; it is unclean.

014:045 And he shall break down the house, the stones of it, and the
        timber thereof, and all the morter of the house; and he shall
        carry them forth out of the city into an unclean place.

014:046 Moreover he that goeth into the house all the while that it is
        shut up shall be unclean until the even.

014:047 And he that lieth in the house shall wash his clothes; and he
        that eateth in the house shall wash his clothes.

014:048 And if the priest shall come in, and look upon it, and,
        behold, the plague hath not spread in the house, after the
        house was plaistered: then the priest shall pronounce the
        house clean, because the plague is healed.

014:049 And he shall take to cleanse the house two birds, and cedar
        wood, and scarlet, and hyssop:

014:050 And he shall kill the one of the birds in an earthen vessel
        over running water:

014:051 And he shall take the cedar wood, and the hyssop, and the
        scarlet, and the living bird, and dip them in the blood of the
        slain bird, and in the running water, and sprinkle the house
        seven times:

014:052 And he shall cleanse the house with the blood of the bird, and
        with the running water, and with the living bird, and with the
        cedar wood, and with the hyssop, and with the scarlet:

014:053 But he shall let go the living bird out of the city into the
        open fields, and make an atonement for the house: and it shall
        be clean.

014:054 This is the law for all manner of plague of leprosy, and
        scall,

014:055 And for the leprosy of a garment, and of a house,

014:056 And for a rising, and for a scab, and for a bright spot:

014:057 To teach when it is unclean, and when it is clean: this is the
        law of leprosy.

015:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses and to Aaron, saying,

015:002 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When any
        man hath a running issue out of his flesh, because of his
        issue he is unclean.

015:003 And this shall be his uncleanness in his issue: whether his
        flesh run with his issue, or his flesh be stopped from his
        issue, it is his uncleanness.

015:004 Every bed, whereon he lieth that hath the issue, is unclean:
        and every thing, whereon he sitteth, shall be unclean.

015:005 And whosoever toucheth his bed shall wash his clothes, and
        bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even.

015:006 And he that sitteth on any thing whereon he sat that hath the
        issue shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and
        be unclean until the even.

015:007 And he that toucheth the flesh of him that hath the issue
        shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be
        unclean until the even.

015:008 And if he that hath the issue spit upon him that is clean;
        then he shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water,
        and be unclean until the even.

015:009 And what saddle soever he rideth upon that hath the issue
        shall be unclean.

015:010 And whosoever toucheth any thing that was under him shall be
        unclean until the even: and he that beareth any of those
        things shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and
        be unclean until the even.

015:011 And whomsoever he toucheth that hath the issue, and hath not
        rinsed his hands in water, he shall wash his clothes, and
        bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even.

015:012 And the vessel of earth, that he toucheth which hath the
        issue, shall be broken: and every vessel of wood shall be
        rinsed in water.

015:013 And when he that hath an issue is cleansed of his issue; then
        he shall number to himself seven days for his cleansing, and
        wash his clothes, and bathe his flesh in running water, and
        shall be clean.

015:014 And on the eighth day he shall take to him two turtledoves, or
        two young pigeons, and come before the LORD unto the door of
        the tabernacle of the congregation, and give them unto the
        priest:

015:015 And the priest shall offer them, the one for a sin offering,
        and the other for a burnt offering; and the priest shall make
        an atonement for him before the LORD for his issue.

015:016 And if any man's seed of copulation go out from him, then he
        shall wash all his flesh in water, and be unclean until the
        even.

015:017 And every garment, and every skin, whereon is the seed of
        copulation, shall be washed with water, and be unclean until
        the even.

015:018 The woman also with whom man shall lie with seed of
        copulation, they shall both bathe themselves in water, and be
        unclean until the even.

015:019 And if a woman have an issue, and her issue in her flesh be
        blood, she shall be put apart seven days: and whosoever
        toucheth her shall be unclean until the even.

015:020 And every thing that she lieth upon in her separation shall be
        unclean: every thing also that she sitteth upon shall be
        unclean.

015:021 And whosoever toucheth her bed shall wash his clothes, and
        bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even.

015:022 And whosoever toucheth any thing that she sat upon shall wash
        his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be unclean until
        the even.

015:023 And if it be on her bed, or on any thing whereon she sitteth,
        when he toucheth it, he shall be unclean until the even.

015:024 And if any man lie with her at all, and her flowers be upon
        him, he shall be unclean seven days; and all the bed whereon
        he lieth shall be unclean.

015:025 And if a woman have an issue of her blood many days out of the
        time of her separation, or if it run beyond the time of her
        separation; all the days of the issue of her uncleanness shall
        be as the days of her separation: she shall be unclean.

015:026 Every bed whereon she lieth all the days of her issue shall be
        unto her as the bed of her separation: and whatsoever she
        sitteth upon shall be unclean, as the uncleanness of her
        separation.

015:027 And whosoever toucheth those things shall be unclean, and
        shall wash his clothes, and bathe himself in water, and be
        unclean until the even.

015:028 But if she be cleansed of her issue, then she shall number to
        herself seven days, and after that she shall be clean.

015:029 And on the eighth day she shall take unto her two turtles, or
        two young pigeons, and bring them unto the priest, to the door
        of the tabernacle of the congregation.

015:030 And the priest shall offer the one for a sin offering, and the
        other for a burnt offering; and the priest shall make an
        atonement for her before the LORD for the issue of her
        uncleanness.

015:031 Thus shall ye separate the children of Israel from their
        uncleanness; that they die not in their uncleanness, when they
        defile my tabernacle that is among them.

015:032 This is the law of him that hath an issue, and of him whose
        seed goeth from him, and is defiled therewith;

015:033 And of her that is sick of her flowers, and of him that hath
        an issue, of the man, and of the woman, and of him that lieth
        with her that is unclean.

016:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses after the death of the two sons
        of Aaron, when they offered before the LORD, and died;

016:002 And the LORD said unto Moses, Speak unto Aaron thy brother,
        that he come not at all times into the holy place within the
        vail before the mercy seat, which is upon the ark; that he die
        not: for I will appear in the cloud upon the mercy seat.

016:003 Thus shall Aaron come into the holy place: with a young
        bullock for a sin offering, and a ram for a burnt offering.

016:004 He shall put on the holy linen coat, and he shall have the
        linen breeches upon his flesh, and shall be girded with a
        linen girdle, and with the linen mitre shall he be attired:
        these are holy garments; therefore shall he wash his flesh in
        water, and so put them on.

016:005 And he shall take of the congregation of the children of
        Israel two kids of the goats for a sin offering, and one ram
        for a burnt offering.

016:006 And Aaron shall offer his bullock of the sin offering, which
        is for himself, and make an atonement for himself, and for his
        house.

016:007 And he shall take the two goats, and present them before the
        LORD at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.

016:008 And Aaron shall cast lots upon the two goats; one lot for the
        LORD, and the other lot for the scapegoat.

016:009 And Aaron shall bring the goat upon which the LORD's lot fell,
        and offer him for a sin offering.

016:010 But the goat, on which the lot fell to be the scapegoat, shall
        be presented alive before the LORD, to make an atonement with
        him, and to let him go for a scapegoat into the wilderness.

016:011 And Aaron shall bring the bullock of the sin offering, which
        is for himself, and shall make an atonement for himself, and
        for his house, and shall kill the bullock of the sin offering
        which is for himself:

016:012 And he shall take a censer full of burning coals of fire from
        off the altar before the LORD, and his hands full of sweet
        incense beaten small, and bring it within the vail:

016:013 And he shall put the incense upon the fire before the LORD,
        that the cloud of the incense may cover the mercy seat that is
        upon the testimony, that he die not:

016:014 And he shall take of the blood of the bullock, and sprinkle it
        with his finger upon the mercy seat eastward; and before the
        mercy seat shall he sprinkle of the blood with his finger
        seven times.

016:015 Then shall he kill the goat of the sin offering, that is for
        the people, and bring his blood within the vail, and do with
        that blood as he did with the blood of the bullock, and
        sprinkle it upon the mercy seat, and before the mercy seat:

016:016 And he shall make an atonement for the holy place, because of
        the uncleanness of the children of Israel, and because of
        their transgressions in all their sins: and so shall he do for
        the tabernacle of the congregation, that remaineth among them
        in the midst of their uncleanness.

016:017 And there shall be no man in the tabernacle of the
        congregation when he goeth in to make an atonement in the holy
        place, until he come out, and have made an atonement for
        himself, and for his household, and for all the congregation
        of Israel.

016:018 And he shall go out unto the altar that is before the LORD,
        and make an atonement for it; and shall take of the blood of
        the bullock, and of the blood of the goat, and put it upon the
        horns of the altar round about.

016:019 And he shall sprinkle of the blood upon it with his finger
        seven times, and cleanse it, and hallow it from the
        uncleanness of the children of Israel.

016:020 And when he hath made an end of reconciling the holy place,
        and the tabernacle of the congregation, and the altar, he
        shall bring the live goat:

016:021 And Aaron shall lay both his hands upon the head of the live
        goat, and confess over him all the iniquities of the children
        of Israel, and all their transgressions in all their sins,
        putting them upon the head of the goat, and shall send him
        away by the hand of a fit man into the wilderness:

016:022 And the goat shall bear upon him all their iniquities unto a
        land not inhabited: and he shall let go the goat in the
        wilderness.

016:023 And Aaron shall come into the tabernacle of the congregation,
        and shall put off the linen garments, which he put on when he
        went into the holy place, and shall leave them there:

016:024 And he shall wash his flesh with water in the holy place, and
        put on his garments, and come forth, and offer his burnt
        offering, and the burnt offering of the people, and make an
        atonement for himself, and for the people.

016:025 And the fat of the sin offering shall he burn upon the altar.

016:026 And he that let go the goat for the scapegoat shall wash his
        clothes, and bathe his flesh in water, and afterward come into
        the camp.

016:027 And the bullock for the sin offering, and the goat for the sin
        offering, whose blood was brought in to make atonement in the
        holy place, shall one carry forth without the camp; and they
        shall burn in the fire their skins, and their flesh, and their
        dung.

016:028 And he that burneth them shall wash his clothes, and bathe his
        flesh in water, and afterward he shall come into the camp.

016:029 And this shall be a statute for ever unto you: that in the
        seventh month, on the tenth day of the month, ye shall afflict
        your souls, and do no work at all, whether it be one of your
        own country, or a stranger that sojourneth among you:

016:030 For on that day shall the priest make an atonement for you, to
        cleanse you, that ye may be clean from all your sins before
        the LORD.

016:031 It shall be a sabbath of rest unto you, and ye shall afflict
        your souls, by a statute for ever.

016:032 And the priest, whom he shall anoint, and whom he shall
        consecrate to minister in the priest's office in his father's
        stead, shall make the atonement, and shall put on the linen
        clothes, even the holy garments:

016:033 And he shall make an atonement for the holy sanctuary, and he
        shall make an atonement for the tabernacle of the
        congregation, and for the altar, and he shall make an
        atonement for the priests, and for all the people of the
        congregation.

016:034 And this shall be an everlasting statute unto you, to make an
        atonement for the children of Israel for all their sins once a
        year. And he did as the LORD commanded Moses.

017:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

017:002 Speak unto Aaron, and unto his sons, and unto all the children
        of Israel, and say unto them; This is the thing which the LORD
        hath commanded, saying,

017:003 What man soever there be of the house of Israel, that killeth
        an ox, or lamb, or goat, in the camp, or that killeth it out
        of the camp,

017:004 And bringeth it not unto the door of the tabernacle of the
        congregation, to offer an offering unto the LORD before the
        tabernacle of the LORD; blood shall be imputed unto that man;
        he hath shed blood; and that man shall be cut off from among
        his people:

017:005 To the end that the children of Israel may bring their
        sacrifices, which they offer in the open field, even that they
        may bring them unto the LORD, unto the door of the tabernacle
        of the congregation, unto the priest, and offer them for peace
        offerings unto the LORD.

017:006 And the priest shall sprinkle the blood upon the altar of the
        LORD at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and
        burn the fat for a sweet savour unto the LORD.

017:007 And they shall no more offer their sacrifices unto devils,
        after whom they have gone a whoring. This shall be a statute
        for ever unto them throughout their generations.

017:008 And thou shalt say unto them, Whatsoever man there be of the
        house of Israel, or of the strangers which sojourn among you,
        that offereth a burnt offering or sacrifice,

017:009 And bringeth it not unto the door of the tabernacle of the
        congregation, to offer it unto the LORD; even that man shall
        be cut off from among his people.

017:010 And whatsoever man there be of the house of Israel, or of the
        strangers that sojourn among you, that eateth any manner of
        blood; I will even set my face against that soul that eateth
        blood, and will cut him off from among his people.

017:011 For the life of the flesh is in the blood: and I have given it
        to you upon the altar to make an atonement for your souls: for
        it is the blood that maketh an atonement for the soul.

017:012 Therefore I said unto the children of Israel, No soul of you
        shall eat blood, neither shall any stranger that sojourneth
        among you eat blood.

017:013 And whatsoever man there be of the children of Israel, or of
        the strangers that sojourn among you, which hunteth and
        catcheth any beast or fowl that may be eaten; he shall even
        pour out the blood thereof, and cover it with dust.

017:014 For it is the life of all flesh; the blood of it is for the
        life thereof: therefore I said unto the children of Israel, Ye
        shall eat the blood of no manner of flesh: for the life of all
        flesh is the blood thereof: whosoever eateth it shall be cut
        off.

017:015 And every soul that eateth that which died of itself, or that
        which was torn with beasts, whether it be one of your own
        country, or a stranger, he shall both wash his clothes, and
        bathe himself in water, and be unclean until the even: then
        shall he be clean.

017:016 But if he wash them not, nor bathe his flesh; then he shall
        bear his iniquity.

018:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

018:002 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, I am the
        LORD your God.

018:003 After the doings of the land of Egypt, wherein ye dwelt, shall
        ye not do: and after the doings of the land of Canaan, whither
        I bring you, shall ye not do: neither shall ye walk in their
        ordinances.

018:004 Ye shall do my judgments, and keep mine ordinances, to walk
        therein: I am the LORD your God.

018:005 Ye shall therefore keep my statutes, and my judgments: which
        if a man do, he shall live in them: I am the LORD.

018:006 None of you shall approach to any that is near of kin to him,
        to uncover their nakedness: I am the LORD.

018:007 The nakedness of thy father, or the nakedness of thy mother,
        shalt thou not uncover: she is thy mother; thou shalt not
        uncover her nakedness.

018:008 The nakedness of thy father's wife shalt thou not uncover: it
        is thy father's nakedness.

018:009 The nakedness of thy sister, the daughter of thy father, or
        daughter of thy mother, whether she be born at home, or born
        abroad, even their nakedness thou shalt not uncover.

018:010 The nakedness of thy son's daughter, or of thy daughter's
        daughter, even their nakedness thou shalt not uncover: for
        theirs is thine own nakedness.

018:011 The nakedness of thy father's wife's daughter, begotten of thy
        father, she is thy sister, thou shalt not uncover her
        nakedness.

018:012 Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy father's sister:
        she is thy father's near kinswoman.

018:013 Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy mother's sister:
        for she is thy mother's near kinswoman.

018:014 Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy father's brother,
        thou shalt not approach to his wife: she is thine aunt.

018:015 Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy daughter in law:
        she is thy son's wife; thou shalt not uncover her nakedness.

018:016 Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy brother's wife: it
        is thy brother's nakedness.

018:017 Thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of a woman and her
        daughter, neither shalt thou take her son's daughter, or her
        daughter's daughter, to uncover her nakedness; for they are
        her near kinswomen: it is wickedness.

018:018 Neither shalt thou take a wife to her sister, to vex her, to
        uncover her nakedness, beside the other in her life time.

018:019 Also thou shalt not approach unto a woman to uncover her
        nakedness, as long as she is put apart for her uncleanness.

018:020 Moreover thou shalt not lie carnally with thy neighbour's
        wife, to defile thyself with her.

018:021 And thou shalt not let any of thy seed pass through the fire
        to Molech, neither shalt thou profane the name of thy God: I
        am the LORD.

018:022 Thou shalt not lie with mankind, as with womankind: it is
        abomination.

018:023 Neither shalt thou lie with any beast to defile thyself
        therewith: neither shall any woman stand before a beast to lie
        down thereto: it is confusion.

018:024 Defile not ye yourselves in any of these things: for in all
        these the nations are defiled which I cast out before you:

018:025 And the land is defiled: therefore I do visit the iniquity
        thereof upon it, and the land itself vomiteth out her
        inhabitants.

018:026 Ye shall therefore keep my statutes and my judgments, and
        shall not commit any of these abominations; neither any of
        your own nation, nor any stranger that sojourneth among you:

018:027 (For all these abominations have the men of the land done,
        which were before you, and the land is defiled;)

018:028 That the land spue not you out also, when ye defile it, as it
        spued out the nations that were before you.

018:029 For whosoever shall commit any of these abominations, even the
        souls that commit them shall be cut off from among their
        people.

018:030 Therefore shall ye keep mine ordinance, that ye commit not any
        one of these abominable customs, which were committed before
        you, and that ye defile not yourselves therein: I am the LORD
        your God.

019:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

019:002 Speak unto all the congregation of the children of Israel, and
        say unto them, Ye shall be holy: for I the LORD your God am
        holy.

019:003 Ye shall fear every man his mother, and his father, and keep
        my sabbaths: I am the LORD your God.

019:004 Turn ye not unto idols, nor make to yourselves molten gods: I
        am the LORD your God.

019:005 And if ye offer a sacrifice of peace offerings unto the LORD,
        ye shall offer it at your own will.

019:006 It shall be eaten the same day ye offer it, and on the morrow:
        and if ought remain until the third day, it shall be burnt in
        the fire.

019:007 And if it be eaten at all on the third day, it is abominable;
        it shall not be accepted.

019:008 Therefore every one that eateth it shall bear his iniquity,
        because he hath profaned the hallowed thing of the LORD: and
        that soul shall be cut off from among his people.

019:009 And when ye reap the harvest of your land, thou shalt not
        wholly reap the corners of thy field, neither shalt thou
        gather the gleanings of thy harvest.

019:010 And thou shalt not glean thy vineyard, neither shalt thou
        gather every grape of thy vineyard; thou shalt leave them for
        the poor and stranger: I am the LORD your God.

019:011 Ye shall not steal, neither deal falsely, neither lie one to
        another.

019:012 And ye shall not swear by my name falsely, neither shalt thou
        profane the name of thy God: I am the LORD.

019:013 Thou shalt not defraud thy neighbour, neither rob him: the
        wages of him that is hired shall not abide with thee all night
        until the morning.

019:014 Thou shalt not curse the deaf, nor put a stumblingblock before
        the blind, but shalt fear thy God: I am the LORD.

019:015 Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment: thou shalt not
        respect the person of the poor, nor honor the person of the
        mighty: but in righteousness shalt thou judge thy neighbour.

019:016 Thou shalt not go up and down as a talebearer among thy
        people: neither shalt thou stand against the blood of thy
        neighbour; I am the LORD.

019:017 Thou shalt not hate thy brother in thine heart: thou shalt in
        any wise rebuke thy neighbour, and not suffer sin upon him.

019:018 Thou shalt not avenge, nor bear any grudge against the
        children of thy people, but thou shalt love thy neighbour as
        thyself: I am the LORD.

019:019 Ye shall keep my statutes. Thou shalt not let thy cattle
        gender with a diverse kind: thou shalt not sow thy field with
        mingled seed: neither shall a garment mingled of linen and
        woollen come upon thee.

019:020 And whosoever lieth carnally with a woman, that is a bondmaid,
        betrothed to an husband, and not at all redeemed, nor freedom
        given her; she shall be scourged; they shall not be put to
        death, because she was not free.

019:021 And he shall bring his trespass offering unto the LORD, unto
        the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, even a ram for
        a trespass offering.

019:022 And the priest shall make an atonement for him with the ram of
        the trespass offering before the LORD for his sin which he
        hath done: and the sin which he hath done shall be forgiven
        him.

019:023 And when ye shall come into the land, and shall have planted
        all manner of trees for food, then ye shall count the fruit
        thereof as uncircumcised: three years shall it be as
        uncircumcised unto you: it shall not be eaten of.

019:024 But in the fourth year all the fruit thereof shall be holy to
        praise the LORD withal.

019:025 And in the fifth year shall ye eat of the fruit thereof, that
        it may yield unto you the increase thereof: I am the LORD your
        God.

019:026 Ye shall not eat any thing with the blood: neither shall ye
        use enchantment, nor observe times.

019:027 Ye shall not round the corners of your heads, neither shalt
        thou mar the corners of thy beard.

019:028 Ye shall not make any cuttings in your flesh for the dead, nor
        print any marks upon you: I am the LORD.

019:029 Do not prostitute thy daughter, to cause her to be a whore;
        lest the land fall to whoredom, and the land become full of
        wickedness.

019:030 Ye shall keep my sabbaths, and reverence my sanctuary: I am
        the LORD.

019:031 Regard not them that have familiar spirits, neither seek after
        wizards, to be defiled by them: I am the LORD your God.

019:032 Thou shalt rise up before the hoary head, and honour the face
        of the old man, and fear thy God: I am the LORD.

019:033 And if a stranger sojourn with thee in your land, ye shall not
        vex him.

019:034 But the stranger that dwelleth with you shall be unto you as
        one born among you, and thou shalt love him as thyself; for ye
        were strangers in the land of Egypt: I am the LORD your God.

019:035 Ye shall do no unrighteousness in judgment, in meteyard, in
        weight, or in measure.

019:036 Just balances, just weights, a just ephah, and a just hin,
        shall ye have: I am the LORD your God, which brought you out
        of the land of Egypt.

019:037 Therefore shall ye observe all my statutes, and all my
        judgments, and do them: I am the LORD.

020:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

020:002 Again, thou shalt say to the children of Israel, Whosoever he
        be of the children of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn
        in Israel, that giveth any of his seed unto Molech; he shall
        surely be put to death: the people of the land shall stone him
        with stones.

020:003 And I will set my face against that man, and will cut him off
        from among his people; because he hath given of his seed unto
        Molech, to defile my sanctuary, and to profane my holy name.

020:004 And if the people of the land do any ways hide their eyes from
        the man, when he giveth of his seed unto Molech, and kill him
        not:

020:005 Then I will set my face against that man, and against his
        family, and will cut him off, and all that go a whoring after
        him, to commit whoredom with Molech, from among their people.

020:006 And the soul that turneth after such as have familiar spirits,
        and after wizards, to go a whoring after them, I will even set
        my face against that soul, and will cut him off from among his
        people.

020:007 Sanctify yourselves therefore, and be ye holy: for I am the
        LORD your God.

020:008 And ye shall keep my statutes, and do them: I am the LORD
        which sanctify you.

020:009 For every one that curseth his father or his mother shall be
        surely put to death: he hath cursed his father or his mother;
        his blood shall be upon him.

020:010 And the man that committeth adultery with another man's wife,
        even he that committeth adultery with his neighbour's wife,
        the adulterer and the adulteress shall surely be put to death.

020:011 And the man that lieth with his father's wife hath uncovered
        his father's nakedness: both of them shall surely be put to
        death; their blood shall be upon them.

020:012 And if a man lie with his daughter in law, both of them shall
        surely be put to death: they have wrought confusion; their
        blood shall be upon them.

020:013 If a man also lie with mankind, as he lieth with a woman, both
        of them have committed an abomination: they shall surely be
        put to death; their blood shall be upon them.

020:014 And if a man take a wife and her mother, it is wickedness:
        they shall be burnt with fire, both he and they; that there be
        no wickedness among you.

020:015 And if a man lie with a beast, he shall surely be put to
        death: and ye shall slay the beast.

020:016 And if a woman approach unto any beast, and lie down thereto,
        thou shalt kill the woman, and the beast: they shall surely be
        put to death; their blood shall be upon them.

020:017 And if a man shall take his sister, his father's daughter, or
        his mother's daughter, and see her nakedness, and she see his
        nakedness; it is a wicked thing; and they shall be cut off in
        the sight of their people: he hath uncovered his sister's
        nakedness; he shall bear his iniquity.

020:018 And if a man shall lie with a woman having her sickness, and
        shall uncover her nakedness; he hath discovered her fountain,
        and she hath uncovered the fountain of her blood: and both of
        them shall be cut off from among their people.

020:019 And thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy mother's
        sister, nor of thy father's sister: for he uncovereth his near
        kin: they shall bear their iniquity.

020:020 And if a man shall lie with his uncle's wife, he hath
        uncovered his uncle's nakedness: they shall bear their sin;
        they shall die childless.

020:021 And if a man shall take his brother's wife, it is an unclean
        thing: he hath uncovered his brother's nakedness; they shall
        be childless.

020:022 Ye shall therefore keep all my statutes, and all my judgments,
        and do them: that the land, whither I bring you to dwell
        therein, spue you not out.

020:023 And ye shall not walk in the manners of the nation, which I
        cast out before you: for they committed all these things, and
        therefore I abhorred them.

020:024 But I have said unto you, Ye shall inherit their land, and I
        will give it unto you to possess it, a land that floweth with
        milk and honey: I am the LORD your God, which have separated
        you from other people.

020:025 Ye shall therefore put difference between clean beasts and
        unclean, and between unclean fowls and clean: and ye shall not
        make your souls abominable by beast, or by fowl, or by any
        manner of living thing that creepeth on the ground, which I
        have separated from you as unclean.

020:026 And ye shall be holy unto me: for I the LORD am holy, and have
        severed you from other people, that ye should be mine.

020:027 A man also or woman that hath a familiar spirit, or that is a
        wizard, shall surely be put to death: they shall stone them
        with stones: their blood shall be upon them.

021:001 And the LORD said unto Moses, Speak unto the priests the sons
        of Aaron, and say unto them, There shall none be defiled for
        the dead among his people:

021:002 But for his kin, that is near unto him, that is, for his
        mother, and for his father, and for his son, and for his
        daughter, and for his brother.

021:003 And for his sister a virgin, that is nigh unto him, which hath
        had no husband; for her may he be defiled.

021:004 But he shall not defile himself, being a chief man among his
        people, to profane himself.

021:005 They shall not make baldness upon their head, neither shall
        they shave off the corner of their beard, nor make any
        cuttings in their flesh.

021:006 They shall be holy unto their God, and not profane the name of
        their God: for the offerings of the LORD made by fire, and the
        bread of their God, they do offer: therefore they shall be
        holy.

021:007 They shall not take a wife that is a whore, or profane;
        neither shall they take a woman put away from her husband: for
        he is holy unto his God.

021:008 Thou shalt sanctify him therefore; for he offereth the bread
        of thy God: he shall be holy unto thee: for I the LORD, which
        sanctify you, am holy.

021:009 And the daughter of any priest, if she profane herself by
        playing the whore, she profaneth her father: she shall be
        burnt with fire.

021:010 And he that is the high priest among his brethren, upon whose
        head the anointing oil was poured, and that is consecrated to
        put on the garments, shall not uncover his head, nor rend his
        clothes;

021:011 Neither shall he go in to any dead body, nor defile himself
        for his father, or for his mother;

021:012 Neither shall he go out of the sanctuary, nor profane the
        sanctuary of his God; for the crown of the anointing oil of
        his God is upon him: I am the LORD.

021:013 And he shall take a wife in her virginity.

021:014 A widow, or a divorced woman, or profane, or an harlot, these
        shall he not take: but he shall take a virgin of his own
        people to wife.

021:015 Neither shall he profane his seed among his people: for I the
        LORD do sanctify him.

021:016 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

021:017 Speak unto Aaron, saying, Whosoever he be of thy seed in their
        generations that hath any blemish, let him not approach to
        offer the bread of his God.

021:018 For whatsoever man he be that hath a blemish, he shall not
        approach: a blind man, or a lame, or he that hath a flat nose,
        or any thing superfluous,

021:019 Or a man that is brokenfooted, or brokenhanded,

021:020 Or crookbackt, or a dwarf, or that hath a blemish in his eye,
        or be scurvy, or scabbed, or hath his stones broken;

021:021 No man that hath a blemish of the seed of Aaron the priest
        shall come nigh to offer the offerings of the LORD made by
        fire: he hath a blemish; he shall not come nigh to offer the
        bread of his God.

021:022 He shall eat the bread of his God, both of the most holy, and
        of the holy.

021:023 Only he shall not go in unto the vail, nor come nigh unto the
        altar, because he hath a blemish; that he profane not my
        sanctuaries: for I the LORD do sanctify them.

021:024 And Moses told it unto Aaron, and to his sons, and unto all
        the children of Israel.

022:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

022:002 Speak unto Aaron and to his sons, that they separate
        themselves from the holy things of the children of Israel, and
        that they profane not my holy name in those things which they
        hallow unto me: I am the LORD.

022:003 Say unto them, Whosoever he be of all your seed among your
        generations, that goeth unto the holy things, which the
        children of Israel hallow unto the LORD, having his
        uncleanness upon him, that soul shall be cut off from my
        presence: I am the LORD.

022:004 What man soever of the seed of Aaron is a leper, or hath a
        running issue; he shall not eat of the holy things, until he
        be clean. And whoso toucheth any thing that is unclean by the
        dead, or a man whose seed goeth from him;

022:005 Or whosoever toucheth any creeping thing, whereby he may be
        made unclean, or a man of whom he may take uncleanness,
        whatsoever uncleanness he hath;

022:006 The soul which hath touched any such shall be unclean until
        even, and shall not eat of the holy things, unless he wash his
        flesh with water.

022:007 And when the sun is down, he shall be clean, and shall
        afterward eat of the holy things; because it is his food.

022:008 That which dieth of itself, or is torn with beasts, he shall
        not eat to defile himself therewith; I am the LORD.

022:009 They shall therefore keep mine ordinance, lest they bear sin
        for it, and die therefore, if they profane it: I the LORD do
        sanctify them.

022:010 There shall no stranger eat of the holy thing: a sojourner of
        the priest, or an hired servant, shall not eat of the holy
        thing.

022:011 But if the priest buy any soul with his money, he shall eat of
        it, and he that is born in his house: they shall eat of his
        meat.

022:012 If the priest's daughter also be married unto a stranger, she
        may not eat of an offering of the holy things.

022:013 But if the priest's daughter be a widow, or divorced, and have
        no child, and is returned unto her father's house, as in her
        youth, she shall eat of her father's meat: but there shall be
        no stranger eat thereof.

022:014 And if a man eat of the holy thing unwittingly, then he shall
        put the fifth part thereof unto it, and shall give it unto the
        priest with the holy thing.

022:015 And they shall not profane the holy things of the children of
        Israel, which they offer unto the LORD;

022:016 Or suffer them to bear the iniquity of trespass, when they eat
        their holy things: for I the LORD do sanctify them.

022:017 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

022:018 Speak unto Aaron, and to his sons, and unto all the children
        of Israel, and say unto them, Whatsoever he be of the house of
        Israel, or of the strangers in Israel, that will offer his
        oblation for all his vows, and for all his freewill offerings,
        which they will offer unto the LORD for a burnt offering;

022:019 Ye shall offer at your own will a male without blemish, of the
        beeves, of the sheep, or of the goats.

022:020 But whatsoever hath a blemish, that shall ye not offer: for it
        shall not be acceptable for you.

022:021 And whosoever offereth a sacrifice of peace offerings unto the
        LORD to accomplish his vow, or a freewill offering in beeves
        or sheep, it shall be perfect to be accepted; there shall be
        no blemish therein.

022:022 Blind, or broken, or maimed, or having a wen, or scurvy, or
        scabbed, ye shall not offer these unto the LORD, nor make an
        offering by fire of them upon the altar unto the LORD.

022:023 Either a bullock or a lamb that hath any thing superfluous or
        lacking in his parts, that mayest thou offer for a freewill
        offering; but for a vow it shall not be accepted.

022:024 Ye shall not offer unto the LORD that which is bruised, or
        crushed, or broken, or cut; neither shall ye make any offering
        thereof in your land.

022:025 Neither from a stranger's hand shall ye offer the bread of
        your God of any of these; because their corruption is in them,
        and blemishes be in them: they shall not be accepted for you.

022:026 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

022:027 When a bullock, or a sheep, or a goat, is brought forth, then
        it shall be seven days under the dam; and from the eighth day
        and thenceforth it shall be accepted for an offering made by
        fire unto the LORD.

022:028 And whether it be cow, or ewe, ye shall not kill it and her
        young both in one day.

022:029 And when ye will offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving unto the
        LORD, offer it at your own will.

022:030 On the same day it shall be eaten up; ye shall leave none of
        it until the morrow: I am the LORD.

022:031 Therefore shall ye keep my commandments, and do them: I am the
        LORD.

022:032 Neither shall ye profane my holy name; but I will be hallowed
        among the children of Israel: I am the LORD which hallow you,

022:033 That brought you out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: I
        am the LORD.

023:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

023:002 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them,
        Concerning the feasts of the LORD, which ye shall proclaim to
        be holy convocations, even these are my feasts.

023:003 Six days shall work be done: but the seventh day is the
        sabbath of rest, an holy convocation; ye shall do no work
        therein: it is the sabbath of the LORD in all your dwellings.

023:004 These are the feasts of the LORD, even holy convocations,
        which ye shall proclaim in their seasons.

023:005 In the fourteenth day of the first month at even is the LORD's
        passover.

023:006 And on the fifteenth day of the same month is the feast of
        unleavened bread unto the LORD: seven days ye must eat
        unleavened bread.

023:007 In the first day ye shall have an holy convocation: ye shall
        do no servile work therein.

023:008 But ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD
        seven days: in the seventh day is an holy convocation: ye
        shall do no servile work therein.

023:009 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

023:010 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye
        be come into the land which I give unto you, and shall reap
        the harvest thereof, then ye shall bring a sheaf of the
        firstfruits of your harvest unto the priest:

023:011 And he shall wave the sheaf before the LORD, to be accepted
        for you: on the morrow after the sabbath the priest shall wave
        it.

023:012 And ye shall offer that day when ye wave the sheaf an he lamb
        without blemish of the first year for a burnt offering unto
        the LORD.

023:013 And the meat offering thereof shall be two tenth deals of fine
        flour mingled with oil, an offering made by fire unto the LORD
        for a sweet savour: and the drink offering thereof shall be of
        wine, the fourth part of an hin.

023:014 And ye shall eat neither bread, nor parched corn, nor green
        ears, until the selfsame day that ye have brought an offering
        unto your God: it shall be a statute for ever throughout your
        generations in all your dwellings.

023:015 And ye shall count unto you from the morrow after the sabbath,
        from the day that ye brought the sheaf of the wave offering;
        seven sabbaths shall be complete:

023:016 Even unto the morrow after the seventh sabbath shall ye number
        fifty days; and ye shall offer a new meat offering unto the
        LORD.

023:017 Ye shall bring out of your habitations two wave loaves of two
        tenth deals; they shall be of fine flour; they shall be baken
        with leaven; they are the firstfruits unto the LORD.

023:018 And ye shall offer with the bread seven lambs without blemish
        of the first year, and one young bullock, and two rams: they
        shall be for a burnt offering unto the LORD, with their meat
        offering, and their drink offerings, even an offering made by
        fire, of sweet savour unto the LORD.

023:019 Then ye shall sacrifice one kid of the goats for a sin
        offering, and two lambs of the first year for a sacrifice of
        peace offerings.

023:020 And the priest shall wave them with the bread of the
        firstfruits for a wave offering before the LORD, with the two
        lambs: they shall be holy to the LORD for the priest.

023:021 And ye shall proclaim on the selfsame day, that it may be an
        holy convocation unto you: ye shall do no servile work
        therein: it shall be a statute for ever in all your dwellings
        throughout your generations.

023:022 And when ye reap the harvest of your land, thou shalt not make
        clean riddance of the corners of thy field when thou reapest,
        neither shalt thou gather any gleaning of thy harvest: thou
        shalt leave them unto the poor, and to the stranger: I am the
        LORD your God.

023:023 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

023:024 Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, In the seventh
        month, in the first day of the month, shall ye have a sabbath,
        a memorial of blowing of trumpets, an holy convocation.

023:025 Ye shall do no servile work therein: but ye shall offer an
        offering made by fire unto the LORD.

023:026 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

023:027 Also on the tenth day of this seventh month there shall be a
        day of atonement: it shall be an holy convocation unto you;
        and ye shall afflict your souls, and offer an offering made by
        fire unto the LORD.

023:028 And ye shall do no work in that same day: for it is a day of
        atonement, to make an atonement for you before the LORD your
        God.

023:029 For whatsoever soul it be that shall not be afflicted in that
        same day, he shall be cut off from among his people.

023:030 And whatsoever soul it be that doeth any work in that same
        day, the same soul will I destroy from among his people.

023:031 Ye shall do no manner of work: it shall be a statute for ever
        throughout your generations in all your dwellings.

023:032 It shall be unto you a sabbath of rest, and ye shall afflict
        your souls: in the ninth day of the month at even, from even
        unto even, shall ye celebrate your sabbath.

023:033 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

023:034 Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, The fifteenth day
        of this seventh month shall be the feast of tabernacles for
        seven days unto the LORD.

023:035 On the first day shall be an holy convocation: ye shall do no
        servile work therein.

023:036 Seven days ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the
        LORD: on the eighth day shall be an holy convocation unto you;
        and ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD: it
        is a solemn assembly; and ye shall do no servile work therein.

023:037 These are the feasts of the LORD, which ye shall proclaim to
        be holy convocations, to offer an offering made by fire unto
        the LORD, a burnt offering, and a meat offering, a sacrifice,
        and drink offerings, every thing upon his day:

023:038 Beside the sabbaths of the LORD, and beside your gifts, and
        beside all your vows, and beside all your freewill offerings,
        which ye give unto the LORD.

023:039 Also in the fifteenth day of the seventh month, when ye have
        gathered in the fruit of the land, ye shall keep a feast unto
        the LORD seven days: on the first day shall be a sabbath, and
        on the eighth day shall be a sabbath.

023:040 And ye shall take you on the first day the boughs of goodly
        trees, branches of palm trees, and the boughs of thick trees,
        and willows of the brook; and ye shall rejoice before the LORD
        your God seven days.

023:041 And ye shall keep it a feast unto the LORD seven days in the
        year. It shall be a statute for ever in your generations: ye
        shall celebrate it in the seventh month.

023:042 Ye shall dwell in booths seven days; all that are Israelites
        born shall dwell in booths:

023:043 That your generations may know that I made the children of
        Israel to dwell in booths, when I brought them out of the land
        of Egypt: I am the LORD your God.

023:044 And Moses declared unto the children of Israel the feasts of
        the LORD.

024:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

024:002 Command the children of Israel, that they bring unto thee pure
        oil olive beaten for the light, to cause the lamps to burn
        continually.

024:003 Without the vail of the testimony, in the tabernacle of the
        congregation, shall Aaron order it from the evening unto the
        morning before the LORD continually: it shall be a statute for
        ever in your generations.

024:004 He shall order the lamps upon the pure candlestick before the
        LORD continually.

024:005 And thou shalt take fine flour, and bake twelve cakes thereof:
        two tenth deals shall be in one cake.

024:006 And thou shalt set them in two rows, six on a row, upon the
        pure table before the LORD.

024:007 And thou shalt put pure frankincense upon each row, that it
        may be on the bread for a memorial, even an offering made by
        fire unto the LORD.

024:008 Every sabbath he shall set it in order before the LORD
        continually, being taken from the children of Israel by an
        everlasting covenant.

024:009 And it shall be Aaron's and his sons'; and they shall eat it
        in the holy place: for it is most holy unto him of the
        offerings of the LORD made by fire by a perpetual statute.

024:010 And the son of an Israelitish woman, whose father was an
        Egyptian, went out among the children of Israel: and this son
        of the Israelitish woman and a man of Israel strove together
        in the camp;

024:011 And the Israelitish woman's son blasphemed the name of the
        Lord, and cursed. And they brought him unto Moses: (and his
        mother's name was Shelomith, the daughter of Dibri, of the
        tribe of Dan:)

024:012 And they put him in ward, that the mind of the LORD might be
        shewed them.

024:013 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

024:014 Bring forth him that hath cursed without the camp; and let all
        that heard him lay their hands upon his head, and let all the
        congregation stone him.

024:015 And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying,
        Whosoever curseth his God shall bear his sin.

024:016 And he that blasphemeth the name of the LORD, he shall surely
        be put to death, and all the congregation shall certainly
        stone him: as well the stranger, as he that is born in the
        land, when he blasphemeth the name of the Lord, shall be put
        to death.

024:017 And he that killeth any man shall surely be put to death.

024:018 And he that killeth a beast shall make it good; beast for
        beast.

024:019 And if a man cause a blemish in his neighbour; as he hath
        done, so shall it be done to him;

024:020 Breach for breach, eye for eye, tooth for tooth: as he hath
        caused a blemish in a man, so shall it be done to him again.

024:021 And he that killeth a beast, he shall restore it: and he that
        killeth a man, he shall be put to death.

024:022 Ye shall have one manner of law, as well for the stranger, as
        for one of your own country: for I am the LORD your God.

024:023 And Moses spake to the children of Israel, that they should
        bring forth him that had cursed out of the camp, and stone him
        with stones. And the children of Israel did as the LORD
        commanded Moses.

025:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses in mount Sinai, saying,

025:002 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye
        come into the land which I give you, then shall the land keep
        a sabbath unto the LORD.

025:003 Six years thou shalt sow thy field, and six years thou shalt
        prune thy vineyard, and gather in the fruit thereof;

025:004 But in the seventh year shall be a sabbath of rest unto the
        land, a sabbath for the LORD: thou shalt neither sow thy
        field, nor prune thy vineyard.

025:005 That which groweth of its own accord of thy harvest thou shalt
        not reap, neither gather the grapes of thy vine undressed: for
        it is a year of rest unto the land.

025:006 And the sabbath of the land shall be meat for you; for thee,
        and for thy servant, and for thy maid, and for thy hired
        servant, and for thy stranger that sojourneth with thee.

025:007 And for thy cattle, and for the beast that are in thy land,
        shall all the increase thereof be meat.

025:008 And thou shalt number seven sabbaths of years unto thee, seven
        times seven years; and the space of the seven sabbaths of
        years shall be unto thee forty and nine years.

025:009 Then shalt thou cause the trumpet of the jubile to sound on
        the tenth day of the seventh month, in the day of atonement
        shall ye make the trumpet sound throughout all your land.

025:010 And ye shall hallow the fiftieth year, and proclaim liberty
        throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof: it
        shall be a jubile unto you; and ye shall return every man unto
        his possession, and ye shall return every man unto his family.

025:011 A jubile shall that fiftieth year be unto you: ye shall not
        sow, neither reap that which groweth of itself in it, nor
        gather the grapes in it of thy vine undressed.

025:012 For it is the jubile; it shall be holy unto you: ye shall eat
        the increase thereof out of the field.

025:013 In the year of this jubile ye shall return every man unto his
        possession.

025:014 And if thou sell ought unto thy neighbour, or buyest ought of
        thy neighbour's hand, ye shall not oppress one another:

025:015 According to the number of years after the jubile thou shalt
        buy of thy neighbour, and according unto the number of years
        of the fruits he shall sell unto thee:

025:016 According to the multitude of years thou shalt increase the
        price thereof, and according to the fewness of years thou
        shalt diminish the price of it: for according to the number of
        the years of the fruits doth he sell unto thee.

025:017 Ye shall not therefore oppress one another; but thou shalt
        fear thy God:for I am the LORD your God.

025:018 Wherefore ye shall do my statutes, and keep my judgments, and
        do them; and ye shall dwell in the land in safety.

025:019 And the land shall yield her fruit, and ye shall eat your
        fill, and dwell therein in safety.

025:020 And if ye shall say, What shall we eat the seventh year?
        behold, we shall not sow, nor gather in our increase:

025:021 Then I will command my blessing upon you in the sixth year,
        and it shall bring forth fruit for three years.

025:022 And ye shall sow the eighth year, and eat yet of old fruit
        until the ninth year; until her fruits come in ye shall eat of
        the old store.

025:023 The land shall not be sold for ever: for the land is mine, for
        ye are strangers and sojourners with me.

025:024 And in all the land of your possession ye shall grant a
        redemption for the land.

025:025 If thy brother be waxen poor, and hath sold away some of his
        possession, and if any of his kin come to redeem it, then
        shall he redeem that which his brother sold.

025:026 And if the man have none to redeem it, and himself be able to
        redeem it;

025:027 Then let him count the years of the sale thereof, and restore
        the overplus unto the man to whom he sold it; that he may
        return unto his possession.

025:028 But if he be not able to restore it to him, then that which is
        sold shall remain in the hand of him that hath bought it until
        the year of jubile: and in the jubile it shall go out, and he
        shall return unto his possession.

025:029 And if a man sell a dwelling house in a walled city, then he
        may redeem it within a whole year after it is sold; within a
        full year may he redeem it.

025:030 And if it be not redeemed within the space of a full year,
        then the house that is in the walled city shall be established
        for ever to him that bought it throughout his generations: it
        shall not go out in the jubile.

025:031 But the houses of the villages which have no wall round about
        them shall be counted as the fields of the country: they may
        be redeemed, and they shall go out in the jubile.

025:032 Notwithstanding the cities of the Levites, and the houses of
        the cities of their possession, may the Levites redeem at any
        time.

025:033 And if a man purchase of the Levites, then the house that was
        sold, and the city of his possession, shall go out in the year
        of jubile: for the houses of the cities of the Levites are
        their possession among the children of Israel.

025:034 But the field of the suburbs of their cities may not be sold;
        for it is their perpetual possession.

025:035 And if thy brother be waxen poor, and fallen in decay with
        thee; then thou shalt relieve him: yea, though he be a
        stranger, or a sojourner; that he may live with thee.

025:036 Take thou no usury of him, or increase: but fear thy God; that
        thy brother may live with thee.

025:037 Thou shalt not give him thy money upon usury, nor lend him thy
        victuals for increase.

025:038 I am the LORD your God, which brought you forth out of the
        land of Egypt, to give you the land of Canaan, and to be your
        God.

025:039 And if thy brother that dwelleth by thee be waxen poor, and be
        sold unto thee; thou shalt not compel him to serve as a
        bondservant:

025:040 But as an hired servant, and as a sojourner, he shall be with
        thee, and shall serve thee unto the year of jubile.

025:041 And then shall he depart from thee, both he and his children
        with him, and shall return unto his own family, and unto the
        possession of his fathers shall he return.

025:042 For they are my servants, which I brought forth out of the
        land of Egypt: they shall not be sold as bondmen.

025:043 Thou shalt not rule over him with rigour; but shalt fear thy
        God.

025:044 Both thy bondmen, and thy bondmaids, which thou shalt have,
        shall be of the heathen that are round about you; of them
        shall ye buy bondmen and bondmaids.

025:045 Moreover of the children of the strangers that do sojourn
        among you, of them shall ye buy, and of their families that
        are with you, which they begat in your land: and they shall be
        your possession.

025:046 And ye shall take them as an inheritance for your children
        after you, to inherit them for a possession; they shall be
        your bondmen for ever: but over your brethren the children of
        Israel, ye shall not rule one over another with rigour.

025:047 And if a sojourner or stranger wax rich by thee, and thy
        brother that dwelleth by him wax poor, and sell himself unto
        the stranger or sojourner by thee, or to the stock of the
        stranger's family:

025:048 After that he is sold he may be redeemed again; one of his
        brethren may redeem him:

025:049 Either his uncle, or his uncle's son, may redeem him, or any
        that is nigh of kin unto him of his family may redeem him; or
        if he be able, he may redeem himself.

025:050 And he shall reckon with him that bought him from the year
        that he was sold to him unto the year of jubile: and the price
        of his sale shall be according unto the number of years,
        according to the time of an hired servant shall it be with
        him.

025:051 If there be yet many years behind, according unto them he
        shall give again the price of his redemption out of the money
        that he was bought for.

025:052 And if there remain but few years unto the year of jubile,
        then he shall count with him, and according unto his years
        shall he give him again the price of his redemption.

025:053 And as a yearly hired servant shall he be with him: and the
        other shall not rule with rigour over him in thy sight.

025:054 And if he be not redeemed in these years, then he shall go out
        in the year of jubile, both he, and his children with him.

025:055 For unto me the children of Israel are servants; they are my
        servants whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt: I am
        the LORD your God.

026:001 Ye shall make you no idols nor graven image, neither rear you
        up a standing image, neither shall ye set up any image of
        stone in your land, to bow down unto it: for I am the LORD
        your God.

026:002 Ye shall keep my sabbaths, and reverence my sanctuary: I am
        the LORD.

026:003 If ye walk in my statutes, and keep my commandments, and do
        them;

026:004 Then I will give you rain in due season, and the land shall
        yield her increase, and the trees of the field shall yield
        their fruit.

026:005 And your threshing shall reach unto the vintage, and the
        vintage shall reach unto the sowing time: and ye shall eat
        your bread to the full, and dwell in your land safely.

026:006 And I will give peace in the land, and ye shall lie down, and
        none shall make you afraid: and I will rid evil beasts out of
        the land, neither shall the sword go through your land.

026:007 And ye shall chase your enemies, and they shall fall before
        you by the sword.

026:008 And five of you shall chase an hundred, and an hundred of you
        shall put ten thousand to flight: and your enemies shall fall
        before you by the sword.

026:009 For I will have respect unto you, and make you fruitful, and
        multiply you, and establish my covenant with you.

026:010 And ye shall eat old store, and bring forth the old because of
        the new.

026:011 And I set my tabernacle among you: and my soul shall not abhor
        you.

026:012 And I will walk among you, and will be your God, and ye shall
        be my people.

026:013 I am the LORD your God, which brought you forth out of the
        land of Egypt, that ye should not be their bondmen; and I have
        broken the bands of your yoke, and made you go upright.

026:014 But if ye will not hearken unto me, and will not do all these
        commandments;

026:015 And if ye shall despise my statutes, or if your soul abhor my
        judgments, so that ye will not do all my commandments, but
        that ye break my covenant:

026:016 I also will do this unto you; I will even appoint over you
        terror, consumption, and the burning ague, that shall consume
        the eyes, and cause sorrow of heart: and ye shall sow your
        seed in vain, for your enemies shall eat it.

026:017 And I will set my face against you, and ye shall be slain
        before your enemies: they that hate you shall reign over you;
        and ye shall flee when none pursueth you.

026:018 And if ye will not yet for all this hearken unto me, then I
        will punish you seven times more for your sins.

026:019 And I will break the pride of your power; and I will make your
        heaven as iron, and your earth as brass:

026:020 And your strength shall be spent in vain: for your land shall
        not yield her increase, neither shall the trees of the land
        yield their fruits.

026:021 And if ye walk contrary unto me, and will not hearken unto me;
        I will bring seven times more plagues upon you according to
        your sins.

026:022 I will also send wild beasts among you, which shall rob you of
        your children, and destroy your cattle, and make you few in
        number; and your high ways shall be desolate.

026:023 And if ye will not be reformed by me by these things, but will
        walk contrary unto me;

026:024 Then will I also walk contrary unto you, and will punish you
        yet seven times for your sins.

026:025 And I will bring a sword upon you, that shall avenge the
        quarrel of my covenant: and when ye are gathered together
        within your cities, I will send the pestilence among you; and
        ye shall be delivered into the hand of the enemy.

026:026 And when I have broken the staff of your bread, ten women
        shall bake your bread in one oven, and they shall deliver you
        your bread again by weight: and ye shall eat, and not be
        satisfied.

026:027 And if ye will not for all this hearken unto me, but walk
        contrary unto me;

026:028 Then I will walk contrary unto you also in fury; and I, even
        I, will chastise you seven times for your sins.

026:029 And ye shall eat the flesh of your sons, and the flesh of your
        daughters shall ye eat.

026:030 And I will destroy your high places, and cut down your images,
        and cast your carcases upon the carcases of your idols, and my
        soul shall abhor you.

026:031 And I will make your cities waste, and bring your sanctuaries
        unto desolation, and I will not smell the savour of your sweet
        odours.

026:032 And I will bring the land into desolation: and your enemies
        which dwell therein shall be astonished at it.

026:033 And I will scatter you among the heathen, and will draw out a
        sword after you: and your land shall be desolate, and your
        cities waste.

026:034 Then shall the land enjoy her sabbaths, as long as it lieth
        desolate, and ye be in your enemies' land; even then shall the
        land rest, and enjoy her sabbaths.

026:035 As long as it lieth desolate it shall rest; because it did not
        rest in your sabbaths, when ye dwelt upon it.

026:036 And upon them that are left alive of you I will send a
        faintness into their hearts in the lands of their enemies; and
        the sound of a shaken leaf shall chase them; and they shall
        flee, as fleeing from a sword; and they shall fall when none
        pursueth.

026:037 And they shall fall one upon another, as it were before a
        sword, when none pursueth: and ye shall have no power to stand
        before your enemies.

026:038 And ye shall perish among the heathen, and the land of your
        enemies shall eat you up.

026:039 And they that are left of you shall pine away in their
        iniquity in your enemies' lands; and also in the iniquities of
        their fathers shall they pine away with them.

026:040 If they shall confess their iniquity, and the iniquity of
        their fathers, with their trespass which they trespassed
        against me, and that also they have walked contrary unto me;

026:041 And that I also have walked contrary unto them, and have
        brought them into the land of their enemies; if then their
        uncircumcised hearts be humbled, and they then accept of the
        punishment of their iniquity:

026:042 Then will I remember my covenant with Jacob, and also my
        covenant with Isaac, and also my covenant with Abraham will I
        remember; and I will remember the land.

026:043 The land also shall be left of them, and shall enjoy her
        sabbaths, while she lieth desolate without them: and they
        shall accept of the punishment of their iniquity: because,
        even because they despised my judgments, and because their
        soul abhorred my statutes.

026:044 And yet for all that, when they be in the land of their
        enemies, I will not cast them away, neither will I abhor them,
        to destroy them utterly, and to break my covenant with them:
        for I am the LORD their God.

026:045 But I will for their sakes remember the covenant of their
        ancestors, whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt in
        the sight of the heathen, that I might be their God: I am the
        LORD.

026:046 These are the statutes and judgments and laws, which the LORD
        made between him and the children of Israel in mount Sinai by
        the hand of Moses.

027:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

027:002 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When a
        man shall make a singular vow, the persons shall be for the
        LORD by thy estimation.

027:003 And thy estimation shall be of the male from twenty years old
        even unto sixty years old, even thy estimation shall be fifty
        shekels of silver, after the shekel of the sanctuary.

027:004 And if it be a female, then thy estimation shall be thirty
        shekels.

027:005 And if it be from five years old even unto twenty years old,
        then thy estimation shall be of the male twenty shekels, and
        for the female ten shekels.

027:006 And if it be from a month old even unto five years old, then
        thy estimation shall be of the male five shekels of silver,
        and for the female thy estimation shall be three shekels of
        silver.

027:007 And if it be from sixty years old and above; if it be a male,
        then thy estimation shall be fifteen shekels, and for the
        female ten shekels.

027:008 But if he be poorer than thy estimation, then he shall present
        himself before the priest, and the priest shall value him;
        according to his ability that vowed shall the priest value
        him.

027:009 And if it be a beast, whereof men bring an offering unto the
        LORD, all that any man giveth of such unto the LORD shall be
        holy.

027:010 He shall not alter it, nor change it, a good for a bad, or a
        bad for a good: and if he shall at all change beast for beast,
        then it and the exchange thereof shall be holy.

027:011 And if it be any unclean beast, of which they do not offer a
        sacrifice unto the LORD, then he shall present the beast
        before the priest:

027:012 And the priest shall value it, whether it be good or bad: as
        thou valuest it, who art the priest, so shall it be.

027:013 But if he will at all redeem it, then he shall add a fifth
        part thereof unto thy estimation.

027:014 And when a man shall sanctify his house to be holy unto the
        LORD, then the priest shall estimate it, whether it be good or
        bad: as the priest shall estimate it, so shall it stand.

027:015 And if he that sanctified it will redeem his house, then he
        shall add the fifth part of the money of thy estimation unto
        it, and it shall be his.

027:016 And if a man shall sanctify unto the LORD some part of a field
        of his possession, then thy estimation shall be according to
        the seed thereof: an homer of barley seed shall be valued at
        fifty shekels of silver.

027:017 If he sanctify his field from the year of jubile, according to
        thy estimation it shall stand.

027:018 But if he sanctify his field after the jubile, then the priest
        shall reckon unto him the money according to the years that
        remain, even unto the year of the jubile, and it shall be
        abated from thy estimation.

027:019 And if he that sanctified the field will in any wise redeem
        it, then he shall add the fifth part of the money of thy
        estimation unto it, and it shall be assured to him.

027:020 And if he will not redeem the field, or if he have sold the
        field to another man, it shall not be redeemed any more.

027:021 But the field, when it goeth out in the jubile, shall be holy
        unto the LORD, as a field devoted; the possession thereof
        shall be the priest's.

027:022 And if a man sanctify unto the LORD a field which he hath
        bought, which is not of the fields of his possession;

027:023 Then the priest shall reckon unto him the worth of thy
        estimation, even unto the year of the jubile: and he shall
        give thine estimation in that day, as a holy thing unto the
        LORD.

027:024 In the year of the jubile the field shall return unto him of
        whom it was bought, even to him to whom the possession of the
        land did belong.

027:025 And all thy estimations shall be according to the shekel of
        the sanctuary: twenty gerahs shall be the shekel.

027:026 Only the firstling of the beasts, which should be the LORD's
        firstling, no man shall sanctify it; whether it be ox, or
        sheep: it is the LORD's.

027:027 And if it be of an unclean beast, then he shall redeem it
        according to thine estimation, and shall add a fifth part of
        it thereto: or if it be not redeemed, then it shall be sold
        according to thy estimation.

027:028 Notwithstanding no devoted thing, that a man shall devote unto
        the LORD of all that he hath, both of man and beast, and of
        the field of his possession, shall be sold or redeemed: every
        devoted thing is most holy unto the LORD.

027:029 None devoted, which shall be devoted of men, shall be
        redeemed; but shall surely be put to death.

027:030 And all the tithe of the land, whether of the seed of the
        land, or of the fruit of the tree, is the LORD's: it is holy
        unto the LORD.

027:031 And if a man will at all redeem ought of his tithes, he shall
        add thereto the fifth part thereof.

027:032 And concerning the tithe of the herd, or of the flock, even of
        whatsoever passeth under the rod, the tenth shall be holy unto
        the LORD.

027:033 He shall not search whether it be good or bad, neither shall
        he change it: and if he change it at all, then both it and the
        change thereof shall be holy; it shall not be redeemed.

027:034 These are the commandments, which the LORD commanded Moses for
        the children of Israel in mount Sinai.

Book 04	Numbers

001:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in
        the tabernacle of the congregation, on the first day of the
        second month, in the second year after they were come out of
        the land of Egypt, saying,

001:002 Take ye the sum of all the congregation of the children of
        Israel, after their families, by the house of their fathers,
        with the number of their names, every male by their polls;

001:003 From twenty years old and upward, all that are able to go
        forth to war in Israel: thou and Aaron shall number them by
        their armies.

001:004 And with you there shall be a man of every tribe; every one
        head of the house of his fathers.

001:005 And these are the names of the men that shall stand with you:

001:016 These were the renowned of the congregation, princes of the
        tribes of their fathers, heads of thousands in Israel.

001:017 And Moses and Aaron took these men which are expressed by
        their names:

001:018 And they assembled all the congregation together on the first
        day of the second month, and they declared their pedigrees
        after their families, by the house of their fathers, according
        to the number of the names, from twenty years old and upward,
        by their polls.

001:019 As the LORD commanded Moses, so he numbered them in the
        wilderness of Sinai.

001:020 And the children of Reuben, Israel's eldest son, by their
        generations, after their families, by the house of their
        fathers, according to the number of the names, by their polls,
        every male from twenty years old and upward, all that were

        Zebulun, were fifty and seven thousand and four hundred.

001:032 Of the children of Joseph, namely, of the children of Ephraim,

        their fathers, according to the number of the names, from
        twenty years old and upward, all that were able to go forth to
        war;

001:033 Those that were numbered of them, even of the tribe of
        Ephraim, were forty thousand and five hundred.

001:034 Of the children of Manasseh, by their generations, after their

001:037 Those that were numbered of them, even of the tribe of
        Benjamin, were thirty and five thousand and four hundred.

001:038 Of the children of Dan, by their generations, after their
        families, by the house of their fathers, according to the

        all that were able to go forth to war;

001:043 Those that were numbered of them, even of the tribe of
        Naphtali, were fifty and three thousand and four hundred.

001:044 These are those that were numbered, which Moses and Aaron
        numbered, and the princes of Israel, being twelve men: each
        one was for the house of his fathers.

001:045 So were all those that were numbered of the children of
        Israel, by the house of their fathers, from twenty years old
        and upward, all that were able to go forth to war in Israel;

001:046 Even all they that were numbered were six hundred thousand and
        three thousand and five hundred and fifty.

001:047 But the Levites after the tribe of their fathers were not
        numbered among them.

001:048 For the LORD had spoken unto Moses, saying,

001:049 Only thou shalt not number the tribe of Levi, neither take the
        sum of them among the children of Israel:

001:050 But thou shalt appoint the Levites over the tabernacle of
        testimony, and over all the vessels thereof, and over all
        things that belong to it: they shall bear the tabernacle, and
        all the vessels thereof; and they shall minister unto it, and
        shall encamp round about the tabernacle.

001:051 And when the tabernacle setteth forward, the Levites shall
        take it down: and when the tabernacle is to be pitched, the
        Levites shall set it up: and the stranger that cometh nigh
        shall be put to death.

001:052 And the children of Israel shall pitch their tents, every man
        by his own camp, and every man by his own standard, throughout
        their hosts.

001:053 But the Levites shall pitch round about the tabernacle of
        testimony, that there be no wrath upon the congregation of the
        children of Israel: and the Levites shall keep the charge of
        the tabernacle of testimony.

001:054 And the children of Israel did according to all that the LORD
        commanded Moses, so did they.

002:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,

002:002 Every man of the children of Israel shall pitch by his own
        standard, with the ensign of their father's house: far off
        about the tabernacle of the congregation shall they pitch.

002:003 And on the east side toward the rising of the sun shall they
        of the standard of the camp of Judah pitch throughout their
        armies: and Nahshon the son of Amminadab shall be captain of
        the children of Judah.

002:004 And his host, and those that were numbered of them, were
        threescore and fourteen thousand and six hundred.

002:005 And those that do pitch next unto him shall be the tribe of
        Issachar: and Nethaneel the son of Zuar shall be captain of
        the children of Issachar.

002:006 And his host, and those that were numbered thereof, were fifty
        and four thousand and four hundred.

002:007 Then the tribe of Zebulun: and Eliab the son of Helon shall be
        captain of the children of Zebulun.

002:008 And his host, and those that were numbered thereof, were fifty
        and seven thousand and four hundred.

002:009 All that were numbered in the camp of Judah were an hundred
        thousand and fourscore thousand and six thousand and four
        hundred, throughout their armies. These shall first set forth.

002:010 On the south side shall be the standard of the camp of Reuben
        according to their armies: and the captain of the children of
        Reuben shall be Elizur the son of Shedeur.

002:011 And his host, and those that were numbered thereof, were forty
        and six thousand and five hundred.

002:012 And those which pitch by him shall be the tribe of Simeon: and
        the captain of the children of Simeon shall be Shelumiel the
        son of Zurishaddai.

002:013 And his host, and those that were numbered of them, were fifty
        and nine thousand and three hundred.

002:014 Then the tribe of Gad: and the captain of the sons of Gad
        shall be Eliasaph the son of Reuel.

002:015 And his host, and those that were numbered of them, were forty
        and five thousand and six hundred and fifty.

002:016 All that were numbered in the camp of Reuben were an hundred
        thousand and fifty and one thousand and four hundred and
        fifty, throughout their armies. And they shall set forth in
        the second rank.

002:017 Then the tabernacle of the congregation shall set forward with
        the camp of the Levites in the midst of the camp: as they
        encamp, so shall they set forward, every man in his place by
        their standards.

002:018 On the west side shall be the standard of the camp of Ephraim
        according to their armies: and the captain of the sons of
        Ephraim shall be Elishama the son of Ammihud.

002:019 And his host, and those that were numbered of them, were forty
        thousand and five hundred.

002:020 And by him shall be the tribe of Manasseh: and the captain of
        the children of Manasseh shall be Gamaliel the son of
        Pedahzur.

002:021 And his host, and those that were numbered of them, were
        thirty and two thousand and two hundred.

002:022 Then the tribe of Benjamin: and the captain of the sons of
        Benjamin shall be Abidan the son of Gideoni.

002:023 And his host, and those that were numbered of them, were
        thirty and five thousand and four hundred.

002:024 All that were numbered of the camp of Ephraim were an hundred
        thousand and eight thousand and an hundred, throughout their
        armies. And they shall go forward in the third rank.

002:025 The standard of the camp of Dan shall be on the north side by
        their armies: and the captain of the children of Dan shall be
        Ahiezer the son of Ammishaddai.

002:026 And his host, and those that were numbered of them, were
        threescore and two thousand and seven hundred.

002:027 And those that encamp by him shall be the tribe of Asher: and
        the captain of the children of Asher shall be Pagiel the son
        of Ocran.

002:028 And his host, and those that were numbered of them, were forty
        and one thousand and five hundred.

002:029 Then the tribe of Naphtali: and the captain of the children of
        Naphtali shall be Ahira the son of Enan.

002:030 And his host, and those that were numbered of them, were fifty
        and three thousand and four hundred.

002:031 All they that were numbered in the camp of Dan were an hundred
        thousand and fifty and seven thousand and six hundred. They
        shall go hindmost with their standards.

002:032 These are those which were numbered of the children of Israel
        by the house of their fathers: all those that were numbered of
        the camps throughout their hosts were six hundred thousand and
        three thousand and five hundred and fifty.

002:033 But the Levites were not numbered among the children of
        Israel; as the LORD commanded Moses.

002:034 And the children of Israel did according to all that the LORD
        commanded Moses: so they pitched by their standards, and so
        they set forward, every one after their families, according to
        the house of their fathers.

003:001 These also are the generations of Aaron and Moses in the day
        that the LORD spake with Moses in mount Sinai.

003:002 And these are the names of the sons of Aaron; Nadab the
        firstborn, and Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar.

003:003 These are the names of the sons of Aaron, the priests which
        were anointed, whom he consecrated to minister in the priest's
        office.

003:004 And Nadab and Abihu died before the LORD, when they offered
        strange fire before the LORD, in the wilderness of Sinai, and
        they had no children: and Eleazar and Ithamar ministered in
        the priest's office in the sight of Aaron their father.

003:005 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

003:006 Bring the tribe of Levi near, and present them before Aaron
        the priest, that they may minister unto him.

003:007 And they shall keep his charge, and the charge of the whole
        congregation before the tabernacle of the congregation, to do
        the service of the tabernacle.

003:008 And they shall keep all the instruments of the tabernacle of
        the congregation, and the charge of the children of Israel, to
        do the service of the tabernacle.

003:009 And thou shalt give the Levites unto Aaron and to his sons:
        they are wholly given unto him out of the children of Israel.

003:010 And thou shalt appoint Aaron and his sons, and they shall wait
        on their priest's office: and the stranger that cometh nigh
        shall be put to death.

003:011 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

003:012 And I, behold, I have taken the Levites from among the
        children of Israel instead of all the firstborn that openeth
        the matrix among the children of Israel: therefore the Levites
        shall be mine;

003:013 Because all the firstborn are mine; for on the day that I
        smote all the firstborn in the land of Egypt I hallowed unto
        me all the firstborn in Israel, both man and beast: mine shall
        they be: I am the LORD.

003:014 And the LORD spake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai,
        saying,

003:015 Number the children of Levi after the house of their fathers,
        by their families: every male from a month old and upward
        shalt thou number them.

003:016 And Moses numbered them according to the word of the LORD, as
        he was commanded.

003:017 And these were the sons of Levi by their names; Gershon, and
        Kohath, and Merari.

003:018 And these are the names of the sons of Gershon by their
        families; Libni, and Shimei.

003:019 And the sons of Kohath by their families; Amram, and Izehar,
        Hebron, and Uzziel.

003:020 And the sons of Merari by their families; Mahli, and Mushi.
        These are the families of the Levites according to the house
        of their fathers.

003:021 Of Gershon was the family of the Libnites, and the family of
        the Shimites: these are the families of the Gershonites.

003:022 Those that were numbered of them, according to the number of
        all the males, from a month old and upward, even those that
        were numbered of them were seven thousand and five hundred.

003:023 The families of the Gershonites shall pitch behind the
        tabernacle westward.

003:024 And the chief of the house of the father of the Gershonites
        shall be Eliasaph the son of Lael.

003:025 And the charge of the sons of Gershon in the tabernacle of the
        congregation shall be the tabernacle, and the tent, the
        covering thereof, and the hanging for the door of the
        tabernacle of the congregation,

003:026 And the hangings of the court, and the curtain for the door of
        the court, which is by the tabernacle, and by the altar round
        about, and the cords of it for all the service thereof.

003:027 And of Kohath was the family of the Amramites, and the family
        of the Izeharites, and the family of the Hebronites, and the
        family of the Uzzielites: these are the families of the
        Kohathites.

003:028 In the number of all the males, from a month old and upward,
        were eight thousand and six hundred, keeping the charge of the
        sanctuary.

003:029 The families of the sons of Kohath shall pitch on the side of
        the tabernacle southward.

003:030 And the chief of the house of the father of the families of
        the Kohathites shall be Elizaphan the son of Uzziel.

003:031 And their charge shall be the ark, and the table, and the
        candlestick, and the altars, and the vessels of the sanctuary
        wherewith they minister, and the hanging, and all the service
        thereof.

003:032 And Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest shall be chief over
        the chief of the Levites, and have the oversight of them that
        keep the charge of the sanctuary.

003:033 Of Merari was the family of the Mahlites, and the family of
        the Mushites: these are the families of Merari.

003:034 And those that were numbered of them, according to the number
        of all the males, from a month old and upward, were six
        thousand and two hundred.

003:035 And the chief of the house of the father of the families of
        Merari was Zuriel the son of Abihail: these shall pitch on the
        side of the tabernacle northward.

003:036 And under the custody and charge of the sons of Merari shall
        be the boards of the tabernacle, and the bars thereof, and the
        pillars thereof, and the sockets thereof, and all the vessels
        thereof, and all that serveth thereto,

003:037 And the pillars of the court round about, and their sockets,
        and their pins, and their cords.

003:038 But those that encamp before the tabernacle toward the east,
        even before the tabernacle of the congregation eastward, shall
        be Moses, and Aaron and his sons, keeping the charge of the
        sanctuary for the charge of the children of Israel; and the
        stranger that cometh nigh shall be put to death.

003:039 All that were numbered of the Levites, which Moses and Aaron
        numbered at the commandment of the LORD, throughout their
        families, all the males from a month old and upward, were
        twenty and two thousand.

003:040 And the LORD said unto Moses, Number all the firstborn of the
        males of the children of Israel from a month old and upward,
        and take the number of their names.

003:041 And thou shalt take the Levites for me (I am the LORD) instead
        of all the firstborn among the children of Israel; and the
        cattle of the Levites instead of all the firstlings among the
        cattle of the children of Israel.

003:042 And Moses numbered, as the LORD commanded him, all the
        firstborn among the children of Israel.

003:043 And all the firstborn males by the number of names, from a
        month old and upward, of those that were numbered of them,
        were twenty and two thousand two hundred and threescore and
        thirteen.

003:044 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

003:045 Take the Levites instead of all the firstborn among the
        children of Israel, and the cattle of the Levites instead of
        their cattle; and the Levites shall be mine: I am the LORD.

003:046 And for those that are to be redeemed of the two hundred and
        threescore and thirteen of the firstborn of the children of
        Israel, which are more than the Levites;

003:047 Thou shalt even take five shekels apiece by the poll, after
        the shekel of the sanctuary shalt thou take them: (the shekel
        is twenty gerahs:)

003:048 And thou shalt give the money, wherewith the odd number of
        them is to be redeemed, unto Aaron and to his sons.

003:049 And Moses took the redemption money of them that were over and
        above them that were redeemed by the Levites:

003:050 Of the firstborn of the children of Israel took he the money;
        a thousand three hundred and threescore and five shekels,
        after the shekel of the sanctuary:

003:051 And Moses gave the money of them that were redeemed unto Aaron
        and to his sons, according to the word of the LORD, as the
        LORD commanded Moses.

004:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,

004:002 Take the sum of the sons of Kohath from among the sons of
        Levi, after their families, by the house of their fathers,

004:003 From thirty years old and upward even until fifty years old,
        all that enter into the host, to do the work in the tabernacle
        of the congregation.

004:004 This shall be the service of the sons of Kohath in the
        tabernacle of the congregation, about the most holy things:

004:005 And when the camp setteth forward, Aaron shall come, and his
        sons, and they shall take down the covering vail, and cover
        the ark of testimony with it:

004:006 And shall put thereon the covering of badgers' skins, and
        shall spread over it a cloth wholly of blue, and shall put in
        the staves thereof.

004:007 And upon the table of shewbread they shall spread a cloth of
        blue, and put thereon the dishes, and the spoons, and the
        bowls, and covers to cover withal: and the continual bread
        shall be thereon:

004:008 And they shall spread upon them a cloth of scarlet, and cover
        the same with a covering of badgers' skins, and shall put in
        the staves thereof.

004:009 And they shall take a cloth of blue, and cover the candlestick
        of the light, and his lamps, and his tongs, and his
        snuffdishes, and all the oil vessels thereof, wherewith they
        minister unto it:

004:010 And they shall put it and all the vessels thereof within a
        covering of badgers' skins, and shall put it upon a bar.

004:011 And upon the golden altar they shall spread a cloth of blue,
        and cover it with a covering of badgers' skins, and shall put
        to the staves thereof:

004:012 And they shall take all the instruments of ministry, wherewith
        they minister in the sanctuary, and put them in a cloth of
        blue, and cover them with a covering of badgers' skins, and
        shall put them on a bar:

004:013 And they shall take away the ashes from the altar, and spread
        a purple cloth thereon:

004:014 And they shall put upon it all the vessels thereof, wherewith
        they minister about it, even the censers, the fleshhooks, and
        the shovels, and the basons, all the vessels of the altar; and
        they shall spread upon it a covering of badgers' skins, and
        put to the staves of it.

004:015 And when Aaron and his sons have made an end of covering the
        sanctuary, and all the vessels of the sanctuary, as the camp
        is to set forward; after that, the sons of Kohath shall come
        to bear it: but they shall not touch any holy thing, lest they
        die. These things are the burden of the sons of Kohath in the
        tabernacle of the congregation.

004:016 And to the office of Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest
        pertaineth the oil for the light, and the sweet incense, and
        the daily meat offering, and the anointing oil, and the
        oversight of all the tabernacle, and of all that therein is,
        in the sanctuary, and in the vessels thereof.

004:017 And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron saying,

004:018 Cut ye not off the tribe of the families of the Kohathites
        from among the Levites:

004:019 But thus do unto them, that they may live, and not die, when
        they approach unto the most holy things: Aaron and his sons
        shall go in, and appoint them every one to his service and to
        his burden:

004:020 But they shall not go in to see when the holy things are
        covered, lest they die.

004:021 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

004:022 Take also the sum of the sons of Gershon, throughout the
        houses of their fathers, by their families;

004:023 From thirty years old and upward until fifty years old shalt
        thou number them; all that enter in to perform the service, to
        do the work in the tabernacle of the congregation.

004:024 This is the service of the families of the Gershonites, to
        serve, and for burdens:

004:025 And they shall bear the curtains of the tabernacle, and the
        tabernacle of the congregation, his covering, and the covering
        of the badgers' skins that is above upon it, and the hanging
        for the door of the tabernacle of the congregation,

004:026 And the hangings of the court, and the hanging for the door of
        the gate of the court, which is by the tabernacle and by the
        altar round about, and their cords, and all the instruments of
        their service, and all that is made for them: so shall they
        serve.

004:027 At the appointment of Aaron and his sons shall be all the
        service of the sons of the Gershonites, in all their burdens,
        and in all their service: and ye shall appoint unto them in
        charge all their burdens.

004:028 This is the service of the families of the sons of Gershon in
        the tabernacle of the congregation: and their charge shall be
        under the hand of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest.

004:029 As for the sons of Merari, thou shalt number them after their
        families, by the house of their fathers;

004:030 From thirty years old and upward even unto fifty years old
        shalt thou number them, every one that entereth into the
        service, to do the work of the tabernacle of the congregation.

004:031 And this is the charge of their burden, according to all their
        service in the tabernacle of the congregation; the boards of
        the tabernacle, and the bars thereof, and the pillars thereof,
        and sockets thereof,

004:032 And the pillars of the court round about, and their sockets,
        and their pins, and their cords, with all their instruments,
        and with all their service: and by name ye shall reckon the
        instruments of the charge of their burden.

004:033 This is the service of the families of the sons of Merari,
        according to all their service, in the tabernacle of the
        congregation, under the hand of Ithamar the son of Aaron the
        priest.

004:034 And Moses and Aaron and the chief of the congregation numbered
        the sons of the Kohathites after their families, and after the
        house of their fathers,

004:035 From thirty years old and upward even unto fifty years old,
        every one that entereth into the service, for the work in the
        tabernacle of the congregation:

004:036 And those that were numbered of them by their families were
        two thousand seven hundred and fifty.

004:037 These were they that were numbered of the families of the
        Kohathites, all that might do service in the tabernacle of the
        congregation, which Moses and Aaron did number according to
        the commandment of the LORD by the hand of Moses.

004:038 And those that were numbered of the sons of Gershon,
        throughout their families, and by the house of their fathers,

004:039 From thirty years old and upward even unto fifty years old,
        every one that entereth into the service, for the work in the
        tabernacle of the congregation,

004:040 Even those that were numbered of them, throughout their
        families, by the house of their fathers, were two thousand and
        six hundred and thirty.

004:041 These are they that were numbered of the families of the sons
        of Gershon, of all that might do service in the tabernacle of
        the congregation, whom Moses and Aaron did number according to
        the commandment of the LORD.

004:042 And those that were numbered of the families of the sons of
        Merari, throughout their families, by the house of their
        fathers,

004:043 From thirty years old and upward even unto fifty years old,
        every one that entereth into the service, for the work in the
        tabernacle of the congregation,

004:044 Even those that were numbered of them after their families,
        were three thousand and two hundred.

004:045 These be those that were numbered of the families of the sons
        of Merari, whom Moses and Aaron numbered according to the word
        of the LORD by the hand of Moses.

004:046 All those that were numbered of the Levites, whom Moses and
        Aaron and the chief of Israel numbered, after their families,
        and after the house of their fathers,

004:047 From thirty years old and upward even unto fifty years old,
        every one that came to do the service of the ministry, and the
        service of the burden in the tabernacle of the congregation.

004:048 Even those that were numbered of them, were eight thousand and
        five hundred and fourscore,

004:049 According to the commandment of the LORD they were numbered by
        the hand of Moses, every one according to his service, and
        according to his burden: thus were they numbered of him, as
        the LORD commanded Moses.

005:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

005:002 Command the children of Israel, that they put out of the camp
        every leper, and every one that hath an issue, and whosoever
        is defiled by the dead:

005:003 Both male and female shall ye put out, without the camp shall
        ye put them; that they defile not their camps, in the midst
        whereof I dwell.

005:004 And the children of Israel did so, and put them out without
        the camp: as the LORD spake unto Moses, so did the children of
        Israel.

005:005 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

005:006 Speak unto the children of Israel, When a man or woman shall
        commit any sin that men commit, to do a trespass against the
        LORD, and that person be guilty;

005:007 Then they shall confess their sin which they have done: and he
        shall recompense his trespass with the principal thereof, and
        add unto it the fifth part thereof, and give it unto him
        against whom he hath trespassed.

005:008 But if the man have no kinsman to recompense the trespass
        unto, let the trespass be recompensed unto the LORD, even to
        the priest; beside the ram of the atonement, whereby an
        atonement shall be made for him.

005:009 And every offering of all the holy things of the children of
        Israel, which they bring unto the priest, shall be his.

005:010 And every man's hallowed things shall be his: whatsoever any
        man giveth the priest, it shall be his.

005:011 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

005:012 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, If any
        man's wife go aside, and commit a trespass against him,

005:013 And a man lie with her carnally, and it be hid from the eyes
        of her husband, and be kept close, and she be defiled, and
        there be no witness against her, neither she be taken with the
        manner;

005:014 And the spirit of jealousy come upon him, and he be jealous of
        his wife, and she be defiled: or if the spirit of jealousy
        come upon him, and he be jealous of his wife, and she be not
        defiled:

005:015 Then shall the man bring his wife unto the priest, and he
        shall bring her offering for her, the tenth part of an ephah
        of barley meal; he shall pour no oil upon it, nor put
        frankincense thereon; for it is an offering of jealousy, an
        offering of memorial, bringing iniquity to remembrance.

005:016 And the priest shall bring her near, and set her before the
        LORD:

005:017 And the priest shall take holy water in an earthen vessel; and
        of the dust that is in the floor of the tabernacle the priest
        shall take, and put it into the water:

005:018 And the priest shall set the woman before the LORD, and
        uncover the woman's head, and put the offering of memorial in
        her hands, which is the jealousy offering: and the priest
        shall have in his hand the bitter water that causeth the
        curse:

005:019 And the priest shall charge her by an oath, and say unto the
        woman, If no man have lain with thee, and if thou hast not
        gone aside to uncleanness with another instead of thy husband,
        be thou free from this bitter water that causeth the curse:

005:020 But if thou hast gone aside to another instead of thy husband,
        and if thou be defiled, and some man have lain with thee
        beside thine husband:

005:021 Then the priest shall charge the woman with an oath of
        cursing, and the priest shall say unto the woman, The LORD
        make thee a curse and an oath among thy people, when the LORD
        doth make thy thigh to rot, and thy belly to swell;

005:022 And this water that causeth the curse shall go into thy
        bowels, to make thy belly to swell, and thy thigh to rot: And
        the woman shall say, Amen, amen.

005:023 And the priest shall write these curses in a book, and he
        shall blot them out with the bitter water:

005:024 And he shall cause the woman to drink the bitter water that
        causeth the curse: and the water that causeth the curse shall
        enter into her, and become bitter.

005:025 Then the priest shall take the jealousy offering out of the
        woman's hand, and shall wave the offering before the LORD, and
        offer it upon the altar:

005:026 And the priest shall take an handful of the offering, even the
        memorial thereof, and burn it upon the altar, and afterward
        shall cause the woman to drink the water.

005:027 And when he hath made her to drink the water, then it shall
        come to pass, that, if she be defiled, and have done trespass
        against her husband, that the water that causeth the curse
        shall enter into her, and become bitter, and her belly shall
        swell, and her thigh shall rot: and the woman shall be a curse
        among her people.

005:028 And if the woman be not defiled, but be clean; then she shall
        be free, and shall conceive seed.

005:029 This is the law of jealousies, when a wife goeth aside to
        another instead of her husband, and is defiled;

005:030 Or when the spirit of jealousy cometh upon him, and he be
        jealous over his wife, and shall set the woman before the
        LORD, and the priest shall execute upon her all this law.

005:031 Then shall the man be guiltless from iniquity, and this woman
        shall bear her iniquity.

006:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

006:002 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When
        either man or woman shall separate themselves to vow a vow of
        a Nazarite, to separate themselves unto the LORD:

006:003 He shall separate himself from wine and strong drink, and
        shall drink no vinegar of wine, or vinegar of strong drink,
        neither shall he drink any liquor of grapes, nor eat moist
        grapes, or dried.

006:004 All the days of his separation shall he eat nothing that is
        made of the vine tree, from the kernels even to the husk.

006:005 All the days of the vow of his separation there shall no razor
        come upon his head: until the days be fulfilled, in the which
        he separateth himself unto the LORD, he shall be holy, and
        shall let the locks of the hair of his head grow.

006:006 All the days that he separateth himself unto the LORD he shall
        come at no dead body.

006:007 He shall not make himself unclean for his father, or for his
        mother, for his brother, or for his sister, when they die:
        because the consecration of his God is upon his head.

006:008 All the days of his separation he is holy unto the LORD.

006:009 And if any man die very suddenly by him, and he hath defiled
        the head of his consecration; then he shall shave his head in
        the day of his cleansing, on the seventh day shall he shave
        it.

006:010 And on the eighth day he shall bring two turtles, or two young
        pigeons, to the priest, to the door of the tabernacle of the
        congregation:

006:011 And the priest shall offer the one for a sin offering, and the
        other for a burnt offering, and make an atonement for him, for
        that he sinned by the dead, and shall hallow his head that
        same day.

006:012 And he shall consecrate unto the LORD the days of his
        separation, and shall bring a lamb of the first year for a
        trespass offering: but the days that were before shall be
        lost, because his separation was defiled.

006:013 And this is the law of the Nazarite, when the days of his
        separation are fulfilled: he shall be brought unto the door of
        the tabernacle of the congregation:

006:014 And he shall offer his offering unto the LORD, one he lamb of
        the first year without blemish for a burnt offering, and one
        ewe lamb of the first year without blemish for a sin offering,
        and one ram without blemish for peace offerings,

006:015 And a basket of unleavened bread, cakes of fine flour mingled
        with oil, and wafers of unleavened bread anointed with oil,
        and their meat offering, and their drink offerings.

006:016 And the priest shall bring them before the LORD, and shall
        offer his sin offering, and his burnt offering:

006:017 And he shall offer the ram for a sacrifice of peace offerings
        unto the LORD, with the basket of unleavened bread: the priest
        shall offer also his meat offering, and his drink offering.

006:018 And the Nazarite shall shave the head of his separation at the
        door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and shall take the
        hair of the head of his separation, and put it in the fire
        which is under the sacrifice of the peace offerings.

006:019 And the priest shall take the sodden shoulder of the ram, and
        one unleavened cake out of the basket, and one unleavened
        wafer, and shall put them upon the hands of the Nazarite,
        after the hair of his separation is shaven:

006:020 And the priest shall wave them for a wave offering before the
        LORD: this is holy for the priest, with the wave breast and
        heave shoulder: and after that the Nazarite may drink wine.

006:021 This is the law of the Nazarite who hath vowed, and of his
        offering unto the LORD for his separation, beside that that
        his hand shall get: according to the vow which he vowed, so he
        must do after the law of his separation.

006:022 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

006:023 Speak unto Aaron and unto his sons, saying, On this wise ye
        shall bless the children of Israel, saying unto them,

006:024 The LORD bless thee, and keep thee:

006:025 The LORD make his face shine upon thee, and be gracious unto
        thee:

006:026 The LORD lift up his countenance upon thee, and give thee
        peace.

006:027 And they shall put my name upon the children of Israel, and I
        will bless them.

007:001 And it came to pass on the day that Moses had fully set up the
        tabernacle, and had anointed it, and sanctified it, and all
        the instruments thereof, both the altar and all the vessels
        thereof, and had anointed them, and sanctified them;

007:002 That the princes of Israel, heads of the house of their
        fathers, who were the princes of the tribes, and were over
        them that were numbered, offered:

007:003 And they brought their offering before the LORD, six covered
        wagons, and twelve oxen; a wagon for two of the princes, and
        for each one an ox: and they brought them before the
        tabernacle.

007:004 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

007:005 Take it of them, that they may be to do the service of the
        tabernacle of the congregation; and thou shalt give them unto
        the Levites, to every man according to his service.

007:006 And Moses took the wagons and the oxen, and gave them unto the
        Levites.

007:007 Two wagons and four oxen he gave unto the sons of Gershon,
        according to their service:

007:008 And four wagons and eight oxen he gave unto the sons of
        Merari, according unto their service, under the hand of
        Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest.

007:009 But unto the sons of Kohath he gave none: because the service
        of the sanctuary belonging unto them was that they should bear
        upon their shoulders.

007:010 And the princes offered for dedicating of the altar in the day
        that it was anointed, even the princes offered their offering
        before the altar.

007:011 And the LORD said unto Moses, They shall offer their offering,
        each prince on his day, for the dedicating of the altar.

007:012 And he that offered his offering the first day was Nahshon the
        son of Amminadab, of the tribe of Judah:

007:013 And his offering was one silver charger, the weight thereof
        was an hundred and thirty shekels, one silver bowl of seventy

007:089 And when Moses was gone into the tabernacle of the
        congregation to speak with him, then he heard the voice of one
        speaking unto him from off the mercy seat that was upon the
        ark of testimony, from between the two cherubims: and he spake
        unto him.

008:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

008:002 Speak unto Aaron and say unto him, When thou lightest the
        lamps, the seven lamps shall give light over against the
        candlestick.

008:003 And Aaron did so; he lighted the lamps thereof over against
        the candlestick, as the LORD commanded Moses.

008:004 And this work of the candlestick was of beaten gold, unto the
        shaft thereof, unto the flowers thereof, was beaten work:
        according unto the pattern which the LORD had shewed Moses, so
        he made the candlestick.

008:005 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

008:006 Take the Levites from among the children of Israel, and
        cleanse them.

008:007 And thus shalt thou do unto them, to cleanse them: Sprinkle
        water of purifying upon them, and let them shave all their
        flesh, and let them wash their clothes, and so make themselves
        clean.

008:008 Then let them take a young bullock with his meat offering,
        even fine flour mingled with oil, and another young bullock
        shalt thou take for a sin offering.

008:009 And thou shalt bring the Levites before the tabernacle of the
        congregation: and thou shalt gather the whole assembly of the
        children of Israel together:

008:010 And thou shalt bring the Levites before the LORD: and the
        children of Israel shall put their hands upon the Levites:

008:011 And Aaron shall offer the Levites before the LORD for an
        offering of the children of Israel, that they may execute the
        service of the LORD.

008:012 And the Levites shall lay their hands upon the heads of the
        bullocks: and thou shalt offer the one for a sin offering, and
        the other for a burnt offering, unto the LORD, to make an
        atonement for the Levites.

008:013 And thou shalt set the Levites before Aaron, and before his
        sons, and offer them for an offering unto the LORD.

008:014 Thus shalt thou separate the Levites from among the children
        of Israel: and the Levites shall be mine.

008:015 And after that shall the Levites go in to do the service of
        the tabernacle of the congregation: and thou shalt cleanse
        them, and offer them for an offering.

008:016 For they are wholly given unto me from among the children of
        Israel; instead of such as open every womb, even instead of
        the firstborn of all the children of Israel, have I taken them
        unto me.

008:017 For all the firstborn of the children of Israel are mine, both
        man and beast: on the day that I smote every firstborn in the
        land of Egypt I sanctified them for myself.

008:018 And I have taken the Levites for all the firstborn of the
        children of Israel.

008:019 And I have given the Levites as a gift to Aaron and to his
        sons from among the children of Israel, to do the service of
        the children of Israel in the tabernacle of the congregation,
        and to make an atonement for the children of Israel: that
        there be no plague among the children of Israel, when the
        children of Israel come nigh unto the sanctuary.

008:020 And Moses, and Aaron, and all the congregation of the children
        of Israel, did to the Levites according unto all that the LORD
        commanded Moses concerning the Levites, so did the children of
        Israel unto them.

008:021 And the Levites were purified, and they washed their clothes;
        and Aaron offered them as an offering before the LORD; and
        Aaron made an atonement for them to cleanse them.

008:022 And after that went the Levites in to do their service in the
        tabernacle of the congregation before Aaron, and before his
        sons: as the LORD had commanded Moses concerning the Levites,
        so did they unto them.

008:023 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

008:024 This is it that belongeth unto the Levites: from twenty and
        five years old and upward they shall go in to wait upon the
        service of the tabernacle of the congregation:

008:025 And from the age of fifty years they shall cease waiting upon
        the service thereof, and shall serve no more:

008:026 But shall minister with their brethren in the tabernacle of
        the congregation, to keep the charge, and shall do no service.
        Thus shalt thou do unto the Levites touching their charge.

009:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses in the wilderness of Sinai, in
        the first month of the second year after they were come out of
        the land of Egypt, saying,

009:002 Let the children of Israel also keep the passover at his
        appointed season.

009:003 In the fourteenth day of this month, at even, ye shall keep it
        in his appointed season: according to all the rites of it, and
        according to all the ceremonies thereof, shall ye keep it.

009:004 And Moses spake unto the children of Israel, that they should
        keep the passover.

009:005 And they kept the passover on the fourteenth day of the first
        month at even in the wilderness of Sinai: according to all
        that the LORD commanded Moses, so did the children of Israel.

009:006 And there were certain men, who were defiled by the dead body
        of a man, that they could not keep the passover on that day:
        and they came before Moses and before Aaron on that day:

009:007 And those men said unto him, We are defiled by the dead body
        of a man: wherefore are we kept back, that we may not offer an
        offering of the LORD in his appointed season among the
        children of Israel?

009:008 And Moses said unto them, Stand still, and I will hear what
        the LORD will command concerning you.

009:009 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

009:010 Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If any man of you
        or of your posterity shall be unclean by reason of a dead
        body, or be in a journey afar off, yet he shall keep the
        passover unto the LORD.

009:011 The fourteenth day of the second month at even they shall keep
        it, and eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs.

009:012 They shall leave none of it unto the morning, nor break any
        bone of it: according to all the ordinances of the passover
        they shall keep it.

009:013 But the man that is clean, and is not in a journey, and
        forbeareth to keep the passover, even the same soul shall be
        cut off from among his people: because he brought not the
        offering of the LORD in his appointed season, that man shall
        bear his sin.

009:014 And if a stranger shall sojourn among you, and will keep the
        passover unto the LORD; according to the ordinance of the
        passover, and according to the manner thereof, so shall he do:
        ye shall have one ordinance, both for the stranger, and for
        him that was born in the land.

009:015 And on the day that the tabernacle was reared up the cloud
        covered the tabernacle, namely, the tent of the testimony: and
        at even there was upon the tabernacle as it were the
        appearance of fire, until the morning.

009:016 So it was alway: the cloud covered it by day, and the
        appearance of fire by night.

009:017 And when the cloud was taken up from the tabernacle, then
        after that the children of Israel journeyed: and in the place
        where the cloud abode, there the children of Israel pitched
        their tents.

009:018 At the commandment of the LORD the children of Israel
        journeyed, and at the commandment of the LORD they pitched: as
        long as the cloud abode upon the tabernacle they rested in
        their tents.

009:019 And when the cloud tarried long upon the tabernacle many days,
        then the children of Israel kept the charge of the LORD, and
        journeyed not.

009:020 And so it was, when the cloud was a few days upon the
        tabernacle; according to the commandment of the LORD they
        abode in their tents, and according to the commandment of the
        LORD they journeyed.

009:021 And so it was, when the cloud abode from even unto the
        morning, and that the cloud was taken up in the morning, then
        they journeyed: whether it was by day or by night that the
        cloud was taken up, they journeyed.

009:022 Or whether it were two days, or a month, or a year, that the
        cloud tarried upon the tabernacle, remaining thereon, the
        children of Israel abode in their tents, and journeyed not:
        but when it was taken up, they journeyed.

009:023 At the commandment of the LORD they rested in the tents, and
        at the commandment of the LORD they journeyed: they kept the
        charge of the LORD, at the commandment of the LORD by the hand
        of Moses.

010:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

010:002 Make thee two trumpets of silver; of a whole piece shalt thou
        make them: that thou mayest use them for the calling of the
        assembly, and for the journeying of the camps.

010:003 And when they shall blow with them, all the assembly shall
        assemble themselves to thee at the door of the tabernacle of
        the congregation.

010:004 And if they blow but with one trumpet, then the princes, which
        are heads of the thousands of Israel, shall gather themselves
        unto thee.

010:005 When ye blow an alarm, then the camps that lie on the east
        parts shall go forward.

010:006 When ye blow an alarm the second time, then the camps that lie
        on the south side shall take their journey: they shall blow an
        alarm for their journeys.

010:007 But when the congregation is to be gathered together, ye shall
        blow, but ye shall not sound an alarm.

010:008 And the sons of Aaron, the priests, shall blow with the
        trumpets; and they shall be to you for an ordinance for ever
        throughout your generations.

010:009 And if ye go to war in your land against the enemy that
        oppresseth you, then ye shall blow an alarm with the trumpets;
        and ye shall be remembered before the LORD your God, and ye
        shall be saved from your enemies.

010:010 Also in the day of your gladness, and in your solemn days, and
        in the beginnings of your months, ye shall blow with the
        trumpets over your burnt offerings, and over the sacrifices of
        your peace offerings; that they may be to you for a memorial
        before your God: I am the LORD your God.

010:011 And it came to pass on the twentieth day of the second month,
        in the second year, that the cloud was taken up from off the
        tabernacle of the testimony.

010:012 And the children of Israel took their journeys out of the
        wilderness of Sinai; and the cloud rested in the wilderness of
        Paran.

010:013 And they first took their journey according to the commandment
        of the LORD by the hand of Moses.

010:014 In the first place went the standard of the camp of the
        children of Judah according to their armies: and over his host
        was Nahshon the son of Amminadab.

010:015 And over the host of the tribe of the children of Issachar was
        Nethaneel the son of Zuar.

010:016 And over the host of the tribe of the children of Zebulun was
        Eliab the son of Helon.

010:017 And the tabernacle was taken down; and the sons of Gershon and
        the sons of Merari set forward, bearing the tabernacle.

010:018 And the standard of the camp of Reuben set forward according
        to their armies: and over his host was Elizur the son of
        Shedeur.

010:019 And over the host of the tribe of the children of Simeon was
        Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai.

010:020 And over the host of the tribe of the children of Gad was
        Eliasaph the son of Deuel.

010:021 And the Kohathites set forward, bearing the sanctuary: and the
        other did set up the tabernacle against they came.

010:022 And the standard of the camp of the children of Ephraim set
        forward according to their armies: and over his host was
        Elishama the son of Ammihud.

010:023 And over the host of the tribe of the children of Manasseh was
        Gamaliel the son of Pedahzur.

010:024 And over the host of the tribe of the children of Benjamin was
        Abidan the son of Gideoni.

010:025 And the standard of the camp of the children of Dan set
        forward, which was the rereward of all the camps throughout
        their hosts: and over his host was Ahiezer the son of
        Ammishaddai.

010:026 And over the host of the tribe of the children of Asher was
        Pagiel the son of Ocran.

010:027 And over the host of the tribe of the children of Naphtali was
        Ahira the son of Enan.

010:028 Thus were the journeyings of the children of Israel according
        to their armies, when they set forward.

010:029 And Moses said unto Hobab, the son of Raguel the Midianite,
        Moses' father in law, We are journeying unto the place of
        which the LORD said, I will give it you: come thou with us,
        and we will do thee good: for the LORD hath spoken good
        concerning Israel.

010:030 And he said unto him, I will not go; but I will depart to mine
        own land, and to my kindred.

010:031 And he said, Leave us not, I pray thee; forasmuch as thou
        knowest how we are to encamp in the wilderness, and thou
        mayest be to us instead of eyes.

010:032 And it shall be, if thou go with us, yea, it shall be, that
        what goodness the LORD shall do unto us, the same will we do
        unto thee.

010:033 And they departed from the mount of the LORD three days'
        journey: and the ark of the covenant of the LORD went before
        them in the three days' journey, to search out a resting place
        for them.

010:034 And the cloud of the LORD was upon them by day, when they went
        out of the camp.

010:035 And it came to pass, when the ark set forward, that Moses
        said, Rise up, LORD, and let thine enemies be scattered; and
        let them that hate thee flee before thee.

010:036 And when it rested, he said, Return, O LORD, unto the many
        thousands of Israel.

011:001 And when the people complained, it displeased the LORD: and
        the LORD heard it; and his anger was kindled; and the fire of
        the LORD burnt among them, and consumed them that were in the
        uttermost parts of the camp.

011:002 And the people cried unto Moses; and when Moses prayed unto
        the LORD, the fire was quenched.

011:003 And he called the name of the place Taberah: because the fire
        of the LORD burnt among them.

011:004 And the mixt multitude that was among them fell a lusting: and
        the children of Israel also wept again, and said, Who shall
        give us flesh to eat?

011:005 We remember the fish, which we did eat in Egypt freely; the
        cucumbers, and the melons, and the leeks, and the onions, and
        the garlick:

011:006 But now our soul is dried away: there is nothing at all,
        beside this manna, before our eyes.

011:007 And the manna was as coriander seed, and the colour thereof as
        the colour of bdellium.

011:008 And the people went about, and gathered it, and ground it in
        mills, or beat it in a mortar, and baked it in pans, and made
        cakes of it: and the taste of it was as the taste of fresh
        oil.

011:009 And when the dew fell upon the camp in the night, the manna
        fell upon it.

011:010 Then Moses heard the people weep throughout their families,
        every man in the door of his tent: and the anger of the LORD
        was kindled greatly; Moses also was displeased.

011:011 And Moses said unto the LORD, Wherefore hast thou afflicted
        thy servant? and wherefore have I not found favour in thy
        sight, that thou layest the burden of all this people upon me?

011:012 Have I conceived all this people? have I begotten them, that
        thou shouldest say unto me, Carry them in thy bosom, as a
        nursing father beareth the sucking child, unto the land which
        thou swarest unto their fathers?

011:013 Whence should I have flesh to give unto all this people? for
        they weep unto me, saying, Give us flesh, that we may eat.

011:014 I am not able to bear all this people alone, because it is too
        heavy for me.

011:015 And if thou deal thus with me, kill me, I pray thee, out of
        hand, if I have found favour in thy sight; and let me not see
        my wretchedness.

011:016 And the LORD said unto Moses, Gather unto me seventy men of
        the elders of Israel, whom thou knowest to be the elders of
        the people, and officers over them; and bring them unto the
        tabernacle of the congregation, that they may stand there with
        thee.

011:017 And I will come down and talk with thee there: and I will take
        of the spirit which is upon thee, and will put it upon them;
        and they shall bear the burden of the people with thee, that
        thou bear it not thyself alone.

011:018 And say thou unto the people, Sanctify yourselves against to
        morrow, and ye shall eat flesh: for ye have wept in the ears
        of the LORD, saying, Who shall give us flesh to eat? for it
        was well with us in Egypt: therefore the LORD will give you
        flesh, and ye shall eat.

011:019 Ye shall not eat one day, nor two days, nor five days, neither
        ten days, nor twenty days;

011:020 But even a whole month, until it come out at your nostrils,
        and it be loathsome unto you: because that ye have despised
        the LORD which is among you, and have wept before him, saying,
        Why came we forth out of Egypt?

011:021 And Moses said, The people, among whom I am, are six hundred
        thousand footmen; and thou hast said, I will give them flesh,
        that they may eat a whole month.

011:022 Shall the flocks and the herds be slain for them, to suffice
        them? or shall all the fish of the sea be gathered together
        for them, to suffice them?

011:023 And the LORD said unto Moses, Is the LORD's hand waxed short?
        thou shalt see now whether my word shall come to pass unto
        thee or not.

011:024 And Moses went out, and told the people the words of the LORD,
        and gathered the seventy men of the elders of the people, and
        set them round about the tabernacle.

011:025 And the LORD came down in a cloud, and spake unto him, and
        took of the spirit that was upon him, and gave it unto the
        seventy elders: and it came to pass, that, when the spirit
        rested upon them, they prophesied, and did not cease.

011:026 But there remained two of the men in the camp, the name of the
        one was Eldad, and the name of the other Medad: and the spirit
        rested upon them; and they were of them that were written, but
        went not out unto the tabernacle: and they prophesied in the
        camp.

011:027 And there ran a young man, and told Moses, and said, Eldad and
        Medad do prophesy in the camp.

011:028 And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of Moses, one of his
        young men, answered and said, My lord Moses, forbid them.

011:029 And Moses said unto him, Enviest thou for my sake? would God
        that all the LORD's people were prophets, and that the LORD
        would put his spirit upon them!

011:030 And Moses gat him into the camp, he and the elders of Israel.

011:031 And there went forth a wind from the LORD, and brought quails
        from the sea, and let them fall by the camp, as it were a
        day's journey on this side, and as it were a day's journey on
        the other side, round about the camp, and as it were two
        cubits high upon the face of the earth.

011:032 And the people stood up all that day, and all that night, and
        all the next day, and they gathered the quails: he that
        gathered least gathered ten homers: and they spread them all
        abroad for themselves round about the camp.

011:033 And while the flesh was yet between their teeth, ere it was
        chewed, the wrath of the LORD was kindled against the people,
        and the LORD smote the people with a very great plague.

011:034 And he called the name of that place Kibrothhattaavah: because
        there they buried the people that lusted.

011:035 And the people journeyed from Kibrothhattaavah unto Hazeroth;
        and abode at Hazeroth.

012:001 And Miriam and Aaron spake against Moses because of the
        Ethiopian woman whom he had married: for he had married an
        Ethiopian woman.

012:002 And they said, Hath the LORD indeed spoken only by Moses? hath
        he not spoken also by us? And the LORD heard it.

012:003 (Now the man Moses was very meek, above all the men which were
        upon the face of the earth.)

012:004 And the LORD spake suddenly unto Moses, and unto Aaron, and
        unto Miriam, Come out ye three unto the tabernacle of the
        congregation. And they three came out.

012:005 And the LORD came down in the pillar of the cloud, and stood
        in the door of the tabernacle, and called Aaron and Miriam:
        and they both came forth.

012:006 And he said, Hear now my words: If there be a prophet among
        you, I the LORD will make myself known unto him in a vision,
        and will speak unto him in a dream.

012:007 My servant Moses is not so, who is faithful in all mine house.

012:008 With him will I speak mouth to mouth, even apparently, and not
        in dark speeches; and the similitude of the LORD shall he
        behold: wherefore then were ye not afraid to speak against my
        servant Moses?

012:009 And the anger of the LORD was kindled against them; and he
        departed.

012:010 And the cloud departed from off the tabernacle; and, behold,
        Miriam became leprous, white as snow: and Aaron looked upon
        Miriam, and, behold, she was leprous.

012:011 And Aaron said unto Moses, Alas, my lord, I beseech thee, lay
        not the sin upon us, wherein we have done foolishly, and
        wherein we have sinned.

012:012 Let her not be as one dead, of whom the flesh is half consumed
        when he cometh out of his mother's womb.

012:013 And Moses cried unto the LORD, saying, Heal her now, O God, I
        beseech thee.

012:014 And the LORD said unto Moses, If her father had but spit in
        her face, should she not be ashamed seven days? let her be
        shut out from the camp seven days, and after that let her be
        received in again.

012:015 And Miriam was shut out from the camp seven days: and the
        people journeyed not till Miriam was brought in again.

012:016 And afterward the people removed from Hazeroth, and pitched in
        the wilderness of Paran.

013:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

013:002 Send thou men, that they may search the land of Canaan, which
        I give unto the children of Israel: of every tribe of their
        fathers shall ye send a man, every one a ruler among them.

013:003 And Moses by the commandment of the LORD sent them from the
        wilderness of Paran: all those men were heads of the children
        of Israel.

013:004 And these were their names: of the tribe of Reuben, Shammua
        the son of Zaccur.

013:005 Of the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat the son of Hori.

013:006 Of the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh.

013:007 Of the tribe of Issachar, Igal the son of Joseph.

013:008 Of the tribe of Ephraim, Oshea the son of Nun.

013:009 Of the tribe of Benjamin, Palti the son of Raphu.

013:010 Of the tribe of Zebulun, Gaddiel the son of Sodi.

013:011 Of the tribe of Joseph, namely, of the tribe of Manasseh,
        Gaddi the son of Susi.

013:012 Of the tribe of Dan, Ammiel the son of Gemalli.

013:013 Of the tribe of Asher, Sethur the son of Michael.

013:014 Of the tribe of Naphtali, Nahbi the son of Vophsi.

013:015 Of the tribe of Gad, Geuel the son of Machi.

013:016 These are the names of the men which Moses sent to spy out the
        land. And Moses called Oshea the son of Nun Jehoshua.

013:017 And Moses sent them to spy out the land of Canaan, and said
        unto them, Get you up this way southward, and go up into the
        mountain:

013:018 And see the land, what it is, and the people that dwelleth
        therein, whether they be strong or weak, few or many;

013:019 And what the land is that they dwell in, whether it be good or
        bad; and what cities they be that they dwell in, whether in
        tents, or in strong holds;

013:020 And what the land is, whether it be fat or lean, whether there
        be wood therein, or not. And be ye of good courage, and bring
        of the fruit of the land. Now the time was the time of the
        firstripe grapes.

013:021 So they went up, and searched the land from the wilderness of
        Zin unto Rehob, as men come to Hamath.

013:022 And they ascended by the south, and came unto Hebron; where
        Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai, the children of Anak, were. (Now
        Hebron was built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.)

013:023 And they came unto the brook of Eshcol, and cut down from
        thence a branch with one cluster of grapes, and they bare it
        between two upon a staff; and they brought of the
        pomegranates, and of the figs.

013:024 The place was called the brook Eshcol, because of the cluster
        of grapes which the children of Israel cut down from thence.

013:025 And they returned from searching of the land after forty days.

013:026 And they went and came to Moses, and to Aaron, and to all the
        congregation of the children of Israel, unto the wilderness of
        Paran, to Kadesh; and brought back word unto them, and unto
        all the congregation, and shewed them the fruit of the land.

013:027 And they told him, and said, We came unto the land whither
        thou sentest us, and surely it floweth with milk and honey;
        and this is the fruit of it.

013:028 Nevertheless the people be strong that dwell in the land, and
        the cities are walled, and very great: and moreover we saw the
        children of Anak there.

013:029 The Amalekites dwell in the land of the south: and the
        Hittites, and the Jebusites, and the Amorites, dwell in the
        mountains: and the Canaanites dwell by the sea, and by the
        coast of Jordan.

013:030 And Caleb stilled the people before Moses, and said, Let us go
        up at once, and possess it; for we are well able to overcome
        it.

013:031 But the men that went up with him said, We be not able to go
        up against the people; for they are stronger than we.

013:032 And they brought up an evil report of the land which they had
        searched unto the children of Israel, saying, The land,
        through which we have gone to search it, is a land that eateth
        up the inhabitants thereof; and all the people that we saw in
        it are men of a great stature.

013:033 And there we saw the giants, the sons of Anak, which come of
        the giants: and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers, and
        so we were in their sight.

014:001 And all the congregation lifted up their voice, and cried; and
        the people wept that night.

014:002 And all the children of Israel murmured against Moses and
        against Aaron: and the whole congregation said unto them,
        Would God that we had died in the land of Egypt! or would God
        we had died in this wilderness!

014:003 And wherefore hath the LORD brought us unto this land, to fall
        by the sword, that our wives and our children should be a
        prey? were it not better for us to return into Egypt?

014:004 And they said one to another, Let us make a captain, and let
        us return into Egypt.

014:005 Then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before all the
        assembly of the congregation of the children of Israel.

014:006 And Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh,
        which were of them that searched the land, rent their clothes:

014:007 And they spake unto all the company of the children of Israel,
        saying, The land, which we passed through to search it, is an
        exceeding good land.

014:008 If the LORD delight in us, then he will bring us into this
        land, and give it us; a land which floweth with milk and
        honey.

014:009 Only rebel not ye against the LORD, neither fear ye the people
        of the land; for they are bread for us: their defence is
        departed from them, and the LORD is with us: fear them not.

014:010 But all the congregation bade stone them with stones. And the
        glory of the LORD appeared in the tabernacle of the
        congregation before all the children of Israel.

014:011 And the LORD said unto Moses, How long will this people
        provoke me? and how long will it be ere they believe me, for
        all the signs which I have shewed among them?

014:012 I will smite them with the pestilence, and disinherit them,
        and will make of thee a greater nation and mightier than they.

014:013 And Moses said unto the LORD, Then the Egyptians shall hear
        it, (for thou broughtest up this people in thy might from
        among them;)

014:014 And they will tell it to the inhabitants of this land: for
        they have heard that thou LORD art among this people, that
        thou LORD art seen face to face, and that thy cloud standeth
        over them, and that thou goest before them, by day time in a
        pillar of a cloud, and in a pillar of fire by night.

014:015 Now if thou shalt kill all this people as one man, then the
        nations which have heard the fame of thee will speak, saying,

014:016 Because the LORD was not able to bring this people into the
        land which he sware unto them, therefore he hath slain them in
        the wilderness.

014:017 And now, I beseech thee, let the power of my Lord be great,
        according as thou hast spoken, saying,

014:018 The LORD is longsuffering, and of great mercy, forgiving
        iniquity and transgression, and by no means clearing the
        guilty, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children
        unto the third and fourth generation.

014:019 Pardon, I beseech thee, the iniquity of this people according
        unto the greatness of thy mercy, and as thou hast forgiven
        this people, from Egypt even until now.

014:020 And the LORD said, I have pardoned according to thy word:

014:021 But as truly as I live, all the earth shall be filled with the
        glory of the LORD.

014:022 Because all those men which have seen my glory, and my
        miracles, which I did in Egypt and in the wilderness, and have
        tempted me now these ten times, and have not hearkened to my
        voice;

014:023 Surely they shall not see the land which I sware unto their
        fathers, neither shall any of them that provoked me see it:

014:024 But my servant Caleb, because he had another spirit with him,
        and hath followed me fully, him will I bring into the land
        whereinto he went; and his seed shall possess it.

014:025 (Now the Amalekites and the Canaanites dwelt in the valley.)
        Tomorrow turn you, and get you into the wilderness by the way
        of the Red sea.

014:026 And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,

014:027 How long shall I bear with this evil congregation, which
        murmur against me? I have heard the murmurings of the children
        of Israel, which they murmur against me.

014:028 Say unto them, As truly as I live, saith the LORD, as ye have
        spoken in mine ears, so will I do to you:

014:029 Your carcases shall fall in this wilderness; and all that were
        numbered of you, according to your whole number, from twenty
        years old and upward which have murmured against me.

014:030 Doubtless ye shall not come into the land, concerning which I
        sware to make you dwell therein, save Caleb the son of
        Jephunneh, and Joshua the son of Nun.

014:031 But your little ones, which ye said should be a prey, them
        will I bring in, and they shall know the land which ye have
        despised.

014:032 But as for you, your carcases, they shall fall in this
        wilderness.

014:033 And your children shall wander in the wilderness forty years,
        and bear your whoredoms, until your carcases be wasted in the
        wilderness.

014:034 After the number of the days in which ye searched the land,
        even forty days, each day for a year, shall ye bear your
        iniquities, even forty years, and ye shall know my breach of
        promise.

014:035 I the LORD have said, I will surely do it unto all this evil
        congregation, that are gathered together against me: in this
        wilderness they shall be consumed, and there they shall die.

014:036 And the men, which Moses sent to search the land, who
        returned, and made all the congregation to murmur against him,
        by bringing up a slander upon the land,

014:037 Even those men that did bring up the evil report upon the
        land, died by the plague before the LORD.

014:038 But Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh,
        which were of the men that went to search the land, lived
        still.

014:039 And Moses told these sayings unto all the children of Israel:
        and the people mourned greatly.

014:040 And they rose up early in the morning, and gat them up into
        the top of the mountain, saying, Lo, we be here, and will go
        up unto the place which the LORD hath promised: for we have
        sinned.

014:041 And Moses said, Wherefore now do ye transgress the commandment
        of the LORD? but it shall not prosper.

014:042 Go not up, for the LORD is not among you; that ye be not
        smitten before your enemies.

014:043 For the Amalekites and the Canaanites are there before you,
        and ye shall fall by the sword: because ye are turned away
        from the LORD, therefore the LORD will not be with you.

014:044 But they presumed to go up unto the hill top: nevertheless the
        ark of the covenant of the LORD, and Moses, departed not out
        of the camp.

014:045 Then the Amalekites came down, and the Canaanites which dwelt
        in that hill, and smote them, and discomfited them, even unto
        Hormah.

015:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

015:002 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye
        be come into the land of your habitations, which I give unto
        you,

015:003 And will make an offering by fire unto the LORD, a burnt
        offering, or a sacrifice in performing a vow, or in a freewill
        offering, or in your solemn feasts, to make a sweet savour
        unto the LORD, of the herd or of the flock:

015:004 Then shall he that offereth his offering unto the LORD bring a
        meat offering of a tenth deal of flour mingled with the fourth
        part of an hin of oil.

015:005 And the fourth part of an hin of wine for a drink offering
        shalt thou prepare with the burnt offering or sacrifice, for
        one lamb.

015:006 Or for a ram, thou shalt prepare for a meat offering two tenth
        deals of flour mingled with the third part of an hin of oil.

015:007 And for a drink offering thou shalt offer the third part of an
        hin of wine, for a sweet savour unto the LORD.

015:008 And when thou preparest a bullock for a burnt offering, or for
        a sacrifice in performing a vow, or peace offerings unto the
        LORD:

015:009 Then shall he bring with a bullock a meat offering of three
        tenth deals of flour mingled with half an hin of oil.

015:010 And thou shalt bring for a drink offering half an hin of wine,
        for an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.

015:011 Thus shall it be done for one bullock, or for one ram, or for
        a lamb, or a kid.

015:012 According to the number that ye shall prepare, so shall ye do
        to every one according to their number.

015:013 All that are born of the country shall do these things after
        this manner, in offering an offering made by fire, of a sweet
        savour unto the LORD.

015:014 And if a stranger sojourn with you, or whosoever be among you
        in your generations, and will offer an offering made by fire,
        of a sweet savour unto the LORD; as ye do, so he shall do.

015:015 One ordinance shall be both for you of the congregation, and
        also for the stranger that sojourneth with you, an ordinance
        for ever in your generations: as ye are, so shall the stranger
        be before the LORD.

015:016 One law and one manner shall be for you, and for the stranger
        that sojourneth with you.

015:017 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

015:018 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye
        come into the land whither I bring you,

015:019 Then it shall be, that, when ye eat of the bread of the land,
        ye shall offer up an heave offering unto the LORD.

015:020 Ye shall offer up a cake of the first of your dough for an
        heave offering: as ye do the heave offering of the
        threshingfloor, so shall ye heave it.

015:021 Of the first of your dough ye shall give unto the LORD an
        heave offering in your generations.

015:022 And if ye have erred, and not observed all these commandments,
        which the LORD hath spoken unto Moses,

015:023 Even all that the LORD hath commanded you by the hand of
        Moses, from the day that the LORD commanded Moses, and
        henceforward among your generations;

015:024 Then it shall be, if ought be committed by ignorance without
        the knowledge of the congregation, that all the congregation
        shall offer one young bullock for a burnt offering, for a
        sweet savour unto the LORD, with his meat offering, and his
        drink offering, according to the manner, and one kid of the
        goats for a sin offering.

015:025 And the priest shall make an atonement for all the
        congregation of the children of Israel, and it shall be
        forgiven them; for it is ignorance: and they shall bring their
        offering, a sacrifice made by fire unto the LORD, and their
        sin offering before the LORD, for their ignorance:

015:026 And it shall be forgiven all the congregation of the children
        of Israel, and the stranger that sojourneth among them; seeing
        all the people were in ignorance.

015:027 And if any soul sin through ignorance, then he shall bring a
        she goat of the first year for a sin offering.

015:028 And the priest shall make an atonement for the soul that
        sinneth ignorantly, when he sinneth by ignorance before the
        LORD, to make an atonement for him; and it shall be forgiven
        him.

015:029 Ye shall have one law for him that sinneth through ignorance,
        both for him that is born among the children of Israel, and
        for the stranger that sojourneth among them.

015:030 But the soul that doeth ought presumptuously, whether he be
        born in the land, or a stranger, the same reproacheth the
        LORD; and that soul shall be cut off from among his people.

015:031 Because he hath despised the word of the LORD, and hath broken
        his commandment, that soul shall utterly be cut off; his
        iniquity shall be upon him.

015:032 And while the children of Israel were in the wilderness, they
        found a man that gathered sticks upon the sabbath day.

015:033 And they that found him gathering sticks brought him unto
        Moses and Aaron, and unto all the congregation.

015:034 And they put him in ward, because it was not declared what
        should be done to him.

015:035 And the LORD said unto Moses, The man shall be surely put to
        death: all the congregation shall stone him with stones
        without the camp.

015:036 And all the congregation brought him without the camp, and
        stoned him with stones, and he died; as the LORD commanded
        Moses.

015:037 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

015:038 Speak unto the children of Israel, and bid them that they make
        them fringes in the borders of their garments throughout their
        generations, and that they put upon the fringe of the borders
        a ribband of blue:

015:039 And it shall be unto you for a fringe, that ye may look upon
        it, and remember all the commandments of the LORD, and do
        them; and that ye seek not after your own heart and your own
        eyes, after which ye use to go a whoring:

015:040 That ye may remember, and do all my commandments, and be holy
        unto your God.

015:041 I am the LORD your God, which brought you out of the land of
        Egypt, to be your God: I am the LORD your God.

016:001 Now Korah, the son of Izhar, the son of Kohath, the son of
        Levi, and Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, and On, the
        son of Peleth, sons of Reuben, took men:

016:002 And they rose up before Moses, with certain of the children of
        Israel, two hundred and fifty princes of the assembly, famous
        in the congregation, men of renown:

016:003 And they gathered themselves together against Moses and
        against Aaron, and said unto them, Ye take too much upon you,
        seeing all the congregation are holy, every one of them, and
        the LORD is among them: wherefore then lift ye up yourselves
        above the congregation of the LORD?

016:004 And when Moses heard it, he fell upon his face:

016:005 And he spake unto Korah and unto all his company, saying, Even
        to morrow the LORD will shew who are his, and who is holy; and
        will cause him to come near unto him: even him whom he hath
        chosen will he cause to come near unto him.

016:006 This do; Take you censers, Korah, and all his company;

016:007 And put fire therein, and put incense in them before the LORD
        to morrow: and it shall be that the man whom the LORD doth
        choose, he shall be holy: ye take too much upon you, ye sons
        of Levi.

016:008 And Moses said unto Korah, Hear, I pray you, ye sons of Levi:

016:009 Seemeth it but a small thing unto you, that the God of Israel
        hath separated you from the congregation of Israel, to bring
        you near to himself to do the service of the tabernacle of the
        LORD, and to stand before the congregation to minister unto
        them?

016:010 And he hath brought thee near to him, and all thy brethren the
        sons of Levi with thee: and seek ye the priesthood also?

016:011 For which cause both thou and all thy company are gathered
        together against the LORD: and what is Aaron, that ye murmur
        against him?

016:012 And Moses sent to call Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab:
        which said, We will not come up:

016:013 Is it a small thing that thou hast brought us up out of a land
        that floweth with milk and honey, to kill us in the
        wilderness, except thou make thyself altogether a prince over
        us?

016:014 Moreover thou hast not brought us into a land that floweth
        with milk and honey, or given us inheritance of fields and
        vineyards: wilt thou put out the eyes of these men? we will
        not come up.

016:015 And Moses was very wroth, and said unto the LORD, Respect not
        thou their offering: I have not taken one ass from them,
        neither have I hurt one of them.

016:016 And Moses said unto Korah, Be thou and all thy company before
        the LORD, thou, and they, and Aaron, to morrow:

016:017 And take every man his censer, and put incense in them, and
        bring ye before the LORD every man his censer, two hundred and
        fifty censers; thou also, and Aaron, each of you his censer.

016:018 And they took every man his censer, and put fire in them, and
        laid incense thereon, and stood in the door of the tabernacle
        of the congregation with Moses and Aaron.

016:019 And Korah gathered all the congregation against them unto the
        door of the tabernacle of the congregation: and the glory of
        the LORD appeared unto all the congregation.

016:020 And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,

016:021 Separate yourselves from among this congregation, that I may
        consume them in a moment.

016:022 And they fell upon their faces, and said, O God, the God of
        the spirits of all flesh, shall one man sin, and wilt thou be
        wroth with all the congregation?

016:023 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

016:024 Speak unto the congregation, saying, Get you up from about the
        tabernacle of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram.

016:025 And Moses rose up and went unto Dathan and Abiram; and the
        elders of Israel followed him.

016:026 And he spake unto the congregation, saying, Depart, I pray
        you, from the tents of these wicked men, and touch nothing of
        their's, lest ye be consumed in all their sins.

016:027 So they gat up from the tabernacle of Korah, Dathan, and
        Abiram, on every side: and Dathan and Abiram came out, and
        stood in the door of their tents, and their wives, and their
        sons, and their little children.

016:028 And Moses said, Hereby ye shall know that the LORD hath sent
        me to do all these works; for I have not done them of mine own
        mind.

016:029 If these men die the common death of all men, or if they be
        visited after the visitation of all men; then the LORD hath
        not sent me.

016:030 But if the LORD make a new thing, and the earth open her
        mouth, and swallow them up, with all that appertain unto them,
        and they go down quick into the pit; then ye shall understand
        that these men have provoked the LORD.

016:031 And it came to pass, as he had made an end of speaking all
        these words, that the ground clave asunder that was under
        them:

016:032 And the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them up, and
        their houses, and all the men that appertained unto Korah, and
        all their goods.

016:033 They, and all that appertained to them, went down alive into
        the pit, and the earth closed upon them: and they perished
        from among the congregation.

016:034 And all Israel that were round about them fled at the cry of
        them: for they said, Lest the earth swallow us up also.

016:035 And there came out a fire from the LORD, and consumed the two
        hundred and fifty men that offered incense.

016:036 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

016:037 Speak unto Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, that he take
        up the censers out of the burning, and scatter thou the fire
        yonder; for they are hallowed.

016:038 The censers of these sinners against their own souls, let them
        make them broad plates for a covering of the altar: for they
        offered them before the LORD, therefore they are hallowed: and
        they shall be a sign unto the children of Israel.

016:039 And Eleazar the priest took the brasen censers, wherewith they
        that were burnt had offered; and they were made broad plates
        for a covering of the altar:

016:040 To be a memorial unto the children of Israel, that no
        stranger, which is not of the seed of Aaron, come near to
        offer incense before the LORD; that he be not as Korah, and as
        his company: as the LORD said to him by the hand of Moses.

016:041 But on the morrow all the congregation of the children of
        Israel murmured against Moses and against Aaron, saying, Ye
        have killed the people of the LORD.

016:042 And it came to pass, when the congregation was gathered
        against Moses and against Aaron, that they looked toward the
        tabernacle of the congregation: and, behold, the cloud covered
        it, and the glory of the LORD appeared.

016:043 And Moses and Aaron came before the tabernacle of the
        congregation.

016:044 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

016:045 Get you up from among this congregation, that I may consume
        them as in a moment. And they fell upon their faces.

016:046 And Moses said unto Aaron, Take a censer, and put fire therein
        from off the altar, and put on incense, and go quickly unto
        the congregation, and make an atonement for them: for there is
        wrath gone out from the LORD; the plague is begun.

016:047 And Aaron took as Moses commanded, and ran into the midst of
        the congregation; and, behold, the plague was begun among the
        people: and he put on incense, and made an atonement for the
        people.

016:048 And he stood between the dead and the living; and the plague
        was stayed.

016:049 Now they that died in the plague were fourteen thousand and
        seven hundred, beside them that died about the matter of
        Korah.

016:050 And Aaron returned unto Moses unto the door of the tabernacle
        of the congregation: and the plague was stayed.

017:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

017:002 Speak unto the children of Israel, and take of every one of
        them a rod according to the house of their fathers, of all
        their princes according to the house of their fathers twelve
        rods: write thou every man's name upon his rod.

017:003 And thou shalt write Aaron's name upon the rod of Levi: for
        one rod shall be for the head of the house of their fathers.

017:004 And thou shalt lay them up in the tabernacle of the
        congregation before the testimony, where I will meet with you.

017:005 And it shall come to pass, that the man's rod, whom I shall
        choose, shall blossom: and I will make to cease from me the
        murmurings of the children of Israel, whereby they murmur
        against you.

017:006 And Moses spake unto the children of Israel, and every one of
        their princes gave him a rod apiece, for each prince one,
        according to their fathers' houses, even twelve rods: and the
        rod of Aaron was among their rods.

017:007 And Moses laid up the rods before the LORD in the tabernacle
        of witness.

017:008 And it came to pass, that on the morrow Moses went into the
        tabernacle of witness; and, behold, the rod of Aaron for the
        house of Levi was budded, and brought forth buds, and bloomed
        blossoms, and yielded almonds.

017:009 And Moses brought out all the rods from before the LORD unto
        all the children of Israel: and they looked, and took every
        man his rod.

017:010 And the LORD said unto Moses, Bring Aaron's rod again before
        the testimony, to be kept for a token against the rebels; and
        thou shalt quite take away their murmurings from me, that they
        die not.

017:011 And Moses did so: as the LORD commanded him, so did he.

017:012 And the children of Israel spake unto Moses, saying, Behold,
        we die, we perish, we all perish.

017:013 Whosoever cometh any thing near unto the tabernacle of the
        LORD shall die: shall we be consumed with dying?

018:001 And the LORD said unto Aaron, Thou and thy sons and thy
        father's house with thee shall bear the iniquity of the
        sanctuary: and thou and thy sons with thee shall bear the
        iniquity of your priesthood.

018:002 And thy brethren also of the tribe of Levi, the tribe of thy
        father, bring thou with thee, that they may be joined unto
        thee, and minister unto thee: but thou and thy sons with thee
        shall minister before the tabernacle of witness.

018:003 And they shall keep thy charge, and the charge of all the
        tabernacle: only they shall not come nigh the vessels of the
        sanctuary and the altar, that neither they, nor ye also, die.

018:004 And they shall be joined unto thee, and keep the charge of the
        tabernacle of the congregation, for all the service of the
        tabernacle: and a stranger shall not come nigh unto you.

018:005 And ye shall keep the charge of the sanctuary, and the charge
        of the altar: that there be no wrath any more upon the
        children of Israel.

018:006 And I, behold, I have taken your brethren the Levites from
        among the children of Israel: to you they are given as a gift
        for the LORD, to do the service of the tabernacle of the
        congregation.

018:007 Therefore thou and thy sons with thee shall keep your priest's
        office for everything of the altar, and within the vail; and
        ye shall serve: I have given your priest's office unto you as
        a service of gift: and the stranger that cometh nigh shall be
        put to death.

018:008 And the LORD spake unto Aaron, Behold, I also have given thee
        the charge of mine heave offerings of all the hallowed things
        of the children of Israel; unto thee have I given them by
        reason of the anointing, and to thy sons, by an ordinance for
        ever.

018:009 This shall be thine of the most holy things, reserved from the
        fire: every oblation of their's, every meat offering of
        their's, and every sin offering of their's, and every trespass
        offering of their's which they shall render unto me, shall be
        most holy for thee and for thy sons.

018:010 In the most holy place shalt thou eat it; every male shall eat
        it: it shall be holy unto thee.

018:011 And this is thine; the heave offering of their gift, with all
        the wave offerings of the children of Israel: I have given
        them unto thee, and to thy sons and to thy daughters with
        thee, by a statute for ever: every one that is clean in thy
        house shall eat of it.

018:012 All the best of the oil, and all the best of the wine, and of
        the wheat, the firstfruits of them which they shall offer unto
        the LORD, them have I given thee.

018:013 And whatsoever is first ripe in the land, which they shall
        bring unto the LORD, shall be thine; every one that is clean
        in thine house shall eat of it.

018:014 Every thing devoted in Israel shall be thine.

018:015 Every thing that openeth the matrix in all flesh, which they
        bring unto the LORD, whether it be of men or beasts, shall be
        thine: nevertheless the firstborn of man shalt thou surely
        redeem, and the firstling of unclean beasts shalt thou redeem.

018:016 And those that are to be redeemed from a month old shalt thou
        redeem, according to thine estimation, for the money of five
        shekels, after the shekel of the sanctuary, which is twenty
        gerahs.

018:017 But the firstling of a cow, or the firstling of a sheep, or
        the firstling of a goat, thou shalt not redeem; they are holy:
        thou shalt sprinkle their blood upon the altar, and shalt burn
        their fat for an offering made by fire, for a sweet savour
        unto the LORD.

018:018 And the flesh of them shall be thine, as the wave breast and
        as the right shoulder are thine.

018:019 All the heave offerings of the holy things, which the children
        of Israel offer unto the LORD, have I given thee, and thy sons
        and thy daughters with thee, by a statute for ever: it is a
        covenant of salt for ever before the LORD unto thee and to thy
        seed with thee.

018:020 And the LORD spake unto Aaron, Thou shalt have no inheritance
        in their land, neither shalt thou have any part among them: I
        am thy part and thine inheritance among the children of
        Israel.

018:021 And, behold, I have given the children of Levi all the tenth
        in Israel for an inheritance, for their service which they
        serve, even the service of the tabernacle of the congregation.

018:022 Neither must the children of Israel henceforth come nigh the
        tabernacle of the congregation, lest they bear sin, and die.

018:023 But the Levites shall do the service of the tabernacle of the
        congregation, and they shall bear their iniquity: it shall be
        a statute for ever throughout your generations, that among the
        children of Israel they have no inheritance.

018:024 But the tithes of the children of Israel, which they offer as
        an heave offering unto the LORD, I have given to the Levites
        to inherit: therefore I have said unto them, Among the
        children of Israel they shall have no inheritance.

018:025 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

018:026 Thus speak unto the Levites, and say unto them, When ye take
        of the children of Israel the tithes which I have given you
        from them for your inheritance, then ye shall offer up an
        heave offering of it for the LORD, even a tenth part of the
        tithe.

018:027 And this your heave offering shall be reckoned unto you, as
        though it were the corn of the threshingfloor, and as the
        fulness of the winepress.

018:028 Thus ye also shall offer an heave offering unto the LORD of
        all your tithes, which ye receive of the children of Israel;
        and ye shall give thereof the LORD's heave offering to Aaron
        the priest.

018:029 Out of all your gifts ye shall offer every heave offering of
        the LORD, of all the best thereof, even the hallowed part
        thereof out of it.

018:030 Therefore thou shalt say unto them, When ye have heaved the
        best thereof from it, then it shall be counted unto the
        Levites as the increase of the threshingfloor, and as the
        increase of the winepress.

018:031 And ye shall eat it in every place, ye and your households:
        for it is your reward for your service in the tabernacle of
        the congregation.

018:032 And ye shall bear no sin by reason of it, when ye have heaved
        from it the best of it: neither shall ye pollute the holy
        things of the children of Israel, lest ye die.

019:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,

019:002 This is the ordinance of the law which the LORD hath
        commanded, saying, Speak unto the children of Israel, that
        they bring thee a red heifer without spot, wherein is no
        blemish, and upon which never came yoke:

019:003 And ye shall give her unto Eleazar the priest, that he may
        bring her forth without the camp, and one shall slay her
        before his face:

019:004 And Eleazar the priest shall take of her blood with his
        finger, and sprinkle of her blood directly before the
        tabernacle of the congregation seven times:

019:005 And one shall burn the heifer in his sight; her skin, and her
        flesh, and her blood, with her dung, shall he burn:

019:006 And the priest shall take cedar wood, and hyssop, and scarlet,
        and cast it into the midst of the burning of the heifer.

019:007 Then the priest shall wash his clothes, and he shall bathe his
        flesh in water, and afterward he shall come into the camp, and
        the priest shall be unclean until the even.

019:008 And he that burneth her shall wash his clothes in water, and
        bathe his flesh in water, and shall be unclean until the even.

019:009 And a man that is clean shall gather up the ashes of the
        heifer, and lay them up without the camp in a clean place, and
        it shall be kept for the congregation of the children of
        Israel for a water of separation: it is a purification for
        sin.

019:010 And he that gathereth the ashes of the heifer shall wash his
        clothes, and be unclean until the even: and it shall be unto
        the children of Israel, and unto the stranger that sojourneth
        among them, for a statute for ever.

019:011 He that toucheth the dead body of any man shall be unclean
        seven days.

019:012 He shall purify himself with it on the third day, and on the
        seventh day he shall be clean: but if he purify not himself
        the third day, then the seventh day he shall not be clean.

019:013 Whosoever toucheth the dead body of any man that is dead, and
        purifieth not himself, defileth the tabernacle of the LORD;
        and that soul shall be cut off from Israel: because the water
        of separation was not sprinkled upon him, he shall be unclean;
        his uncleanness is yet upon him.

019:014 This is the law, when a man dieth in a tent: all that come
        into the tent, and all that is in the tent, shall be unclean
        seven days.

019:015 And every open vessel, which hath no covering bound upon it,
        is unclean.

019:016 And whosoever toucheth one that is slain with a sword in the
        open fields, or a dead body, or a bone of a man, or a grave,
        shall be unclean seven days.

019:017 And for an unclean person they shall take of the ashes of the
        burnt heifer of purification for sin, and running water shall
        be put thereto in a vessel:

019:018 And a clean person shall take hyssop, and dip it in the water,
        and sprinkle it upon the tent, and upon all the vessels, and
        upon the persons that were there, and upon him that touched a
        bone, or one slain, or one dead, or a grave:

019:019 And the clean person shall sprinkle upon the unclean on the
        third day, and on the seventh day: and on the seventh day he
        shall purify himself, and wash his clothes, and bathe himself
        in water, and shall be clean at even.

019:020 But the man that shall be unclean, and shall not purify
        himself, that soul shall be cut off from among the
        congregation, because he hath defiled the sanctuary of the
        LORD: the water of separation hath not been sprinkled upon
        him; he is unclean.

019:021 And it shall be a perpetual statute unto them, that he that
        sprinkleth the water of separation shall wash his clothes; and
        he that toucheth the water of separation shall be unclean
        until even.

019:022 And whatsoever the unclean person toucheth shall be unclean;
        and the soul that toucheth it shall be unclean until even.

020:001 Then came the children of Israel, even the whole congregation,
        into the desert of Zin in the first month: and the people
        abode in Kadesh; and Miriam died there, and was buried there.

020:002 And there was no water for the congregation: and they gathered
        themselves together against Moses and against Aaron.

020:003 And the people chode with Moses, and spake, saying, Would God
        that we had died when our brethren died before the LORD!

020:004 And why have ye brought up the congregation of the LORD into
        this wilderness, that we and our cattle should die there?

020:005 And wherefore have ye made us to come up out of Egypt, to
        bring us in unto this evil place? it is no place of seed, or
        of figs, or of vines, or of pomegranates; neither is there any
        water to drink.

020:006 And Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the assembly
        unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and they
        fell upon their faces: and the glory of the LORD appeared unto
        them.

020:007 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

020:008 Take the rod, and gather thou the assembly together, thou, and
        Aaron thy brother, and speak ye unto the rock before their
        eyes; and it shall give forth his water, and thou shalt bring
        forth to them water out of the rock: so thou shalt give the
        congregation and their beasts drink.

020:009 And Moses took the rod from before the LORD, as he commanded
        him.

020:010 And Moses and Aaron gathered the congregation together before
        the rock, and he said unto them, Hear now, ye rebels; must we
        fetch you water out of this rock?

020:011 And Moses lifted up his hand, and with his rod he smote the
        rock twice: and the water came out abundantly, and the
        congregation drank, and their beasts also.

020:012 And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron, Because ye believed
        me not, to sanctify me in the eyes of the children of Israel,
        therefore ye shall not bring this congregation into the land
        which I have given them.

020:013 This is the water of Meribah; because the children of Israel
        strove with the LORD, and he was sanctified in them.

020:014 And Moses sent messengers from Kadesh unto the king of Edom,
        Thus saith thy brother Israel, Thou knowest all the travail
        that hath befallen us:

020:015 How our fathers went down into Egypt, and we have dwelt in
        Egypt a long time; and the Egyptians vexed us, and our
        fathers:

020:016 And when we cried unto the LORD, he heard our voice, and sent
        an angel, and hath brought us forth out of Egypt: and, behold,
        we are in Kadesh, a city in the uttermost of thy border:

020:017 Let us pass, I pray thee, through thy country: we will not
        pass through the fields, or through the vineyards, neither
        will we drink of the water of the wells: we will go by the
        king's high way, we will not turn to the right hand nor to the
        left, until we have passed thy borders.

020:018 And Edom said unto him, Thou shalt not pass by me, lest I come
        out against thee with the sword.

020:019 And the children of Israel said unto him, We will go by the
        high way: and if I and my cattle drink of thy water, then I
        will pay for it: I will only, without doing anything else, go
        through on my feet.

020:020 And he said, Thou shalt not go through. And Edom came out
        against him with much people, and with a strong hand.

020:021 Thus Edom refused to give Israel passage through his border:
        wherefore Israel turned away from him.

020:022 And the children of Israel, even the whole congregation,
        journeyed from Kadesh, and came unto mount Hor.

020:023 And the LORD spake unto Moses and Aaron in mount Hor, by the
        coast of the land of Edom, saying,

020:024 Aaron shall be gathered unto his people: for he shall not
        enter into the land which I have given unto the children of
        Israel, because ye rebelled against my word at the water of
        Meribah.

020:025 Take Aaron and Eleazar his son, and bring them up unto mount
        Hor:

020:026 And strip Aaron of his garments, and put them upon Eleazar his
        son: and Aaron shall be gathered unto his people, and shall
        die there.

020:027 And Moses did as the LORD commanded: and they went up into
        mount Hor in the sight of all the congregation.

020:028 And Moses stripped Aaron of his garments, and put them upon
        Eleazar his son; and Aaron died there in the top of the mount:
        and Moses and Eleazar came down from the mount.

020:029 And when all the congregation saw that Aaron was dead, they
        mourned for Aaron thirty days, even all the house of Israel.

021:001 And when king Arad the Canaanite, which dwelt in the south,
        heard tell that Israel came by the way of the spies; then he
        fought against Israel, and took some of them prisoners.

021:002 And Israel vowed a vow unto the LORD, and said, If thou wilt
        indeed deliver this people into my hand, then I will utterly
        destroy their cities.

021:003 And the LORD hearkened to the voice of Israel, and delivered
        up the Canaanites; and they utterly destroyed them and their
        cities: and he called the name of the place Hormah.

021:004 And they journeyed from mount Hor by the way of the Red sea,
        to compass the land of Edom: and the soul of the people was
        much discouraged because of the way.

021:005 And the people spake against God, and against Moses, Wherefore
        have ye brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness?
        for there is no bread, neither is there any water; and our
        soul loatheth this light bread.

021:006 And the LORD sent fiery serpents among the people, and they
        bit the people; and much people of Israel died.

021:007 Therefore the people came to Moses, and said, We have sinned,
        for we have spoken against the LORD, and against thee; pray
        unto the LORD, that he take away the serpents from us. And
        Moses prayed for the people.

021:008 And the LORD said unto Moses, Make thee a fiery serpent, and
        set it upon a pole: and it shall come to pass, that every one
        that is bitten, when he looketh upon it, shall live.

021:009 And Moses made a serpent of brass, and put it upon a pole, and
        it came to pass, that if a serpent had bitten any man, when he
        beheld the serpent of brass, he lived.

021:010 And the children of Israel set forward, and pitched in Oboth.

021:011 And they journeyed from Oboth, and pitched at Ijeabarim, in
        the wilderness which is before Moab, toward the sunrising.

021:012 From thence they removed, and pitched in the valley of Zared.

021:013 From thence they removed, and pitched on the other side of
        Arnon, which is in the wilderness that cometh out of the
        coasts of the Amorites: for Arnon is the border of Moab,
        between Moab and the Amorites.

021:014 Wherefore it is said in the book of the wars of the LORD, What
        he did in the Red sea, and in the brooks of Arnon,

021:015 And at the stream of the brooks that goeth down to the
        dwelling of Ar, and lieth upon the border of Moab.

021:016 And from thence they went to Beer: that is the well whereof
        the LORD spake unto Moses, Gather the people together, and I
        will give them water.

021:017 Then Israel sang this song, Spring up, O well; sing ye unto
        it:

021:018 The princes digged the well, the nobles of the people digged
        it, by the direction of the lawgiver, with their staves. And
        from the wilderness they went to Mattanah:

021:019 And from Mattanah to Nahaliel: and from Nahaliel to Bamoth:

021:020 And from Bamoth in the valley, that is in the country of Moab,
        to the top of Pisgah, which looketh toward Jeshimon.

021:021 And Israel sent messengers unto Sihon king of the Amorites,
        saying,

021:022 Let me pass through thy land: we will not turn into the
        fields, or into the vineyards; we will not drink of the waters
        of the well: but we will go along by the king's high way,
        until we be past thy borders.

021:023 And Sihon would not suffer Israel to pass through his border:
        but Sihon gathered all his people together, and went out
        against Israel into the wilderness: and he came to Jahaz, and
        fought against Israel.

021:024 And Israel smote him with the edge of the sword, and possessed
        his land from Arnon unto Jabbok, even unto the children of
        Ammon: for the border of the children of Ammon was strong.

021:025 And Israel took all these cities: and Israel dwelt in all the
        cities of the Amorites, in Heshbon, and in all the villages
        thereof.

021:026 For Heshbon was the city of Sihon the king of the Amorites,
        who had fought against the former king of Moab, and taken all
        his land out of his hand, even unto Arnon.

021:027 Wherefore they that speak in proverbs say, Come into Heshbon,
        let the city of Sihon be built and prepared:

021:028 For there is a fire gone out of Heshbon, a flame from the city
        of Sihon: it hath consumed Ar of Moab, and the lords of the
        high places of Arnon.

021:029 Woe to thee, Moab! thou art undone, O people of Chemosh: he
        hath given his sons that escaped, and his daughters, into
        captivity unto Sihon king of the Amorites.

021:030 We have shot at them; Heshbon is perished even unto Dibon, and
        we have laid them waste even unto Nophah, which reacheth unto
        Medeba.

021:031 Thus Israel dwelt in the land of the Amorites.

021:032 And Moses sent to spy out Jaazer, and they took the villages
        thereof, and drove out the Amorites that were there.

021:033 And they turned and went up by the way of Bashan: and Og the
        king of Bashan went out against them, he, and all his people,
        to the battle at Edrei.

021:034 And the LORD said unto Moses, Fear him not: for I have
        delivered him into thy hand, and all his people, and his land;
        and thou shalt do to him as thou didst unto Sihon king of the
        Amorites, which dwelt at Heshbon.

021:035 So they smote him, and his sons, and all his people, until
        there was none left him alive: and they possessed his land.

022:001 And the children of Israel set forward, and pitched in the
        plains of Moab on this side Jordan by Jericho.

022:002 And Balak the son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to
        the Amorites.

022:003 And Moab was sore afraid of the people, because they were
        many: and Moab was distressed because of the children of
        Israel.

022:004 And Moab said unto the elders of Midian, Now shall this
        company lick up all that are round about us, as the ox licketh
        up the grass of the field. And Balak the son of Zippor was
        king of the Moabites at that time.

022:005 He sent messengers therefore unto Balaam the son of Beor to
        Pethor, which is by the river of the land of the children of
        his people, to call him, saying, Behold, there is a people
        come out from Egypt: behold, they cover the face of the earth,
        and they abide over against me:

022:006 Come now therefore, I pray thee, curse me this people; for
        they are too mighty for me: peradventure I shall prevail, that
        we may smite them, and that I may drive them out of the land:
        for I wot that he whom thou blessest is blessed, and he whom
        thou cursest is cursed.

022:007 And the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed with
        the rewards of divination in their hand; and they came unto
        Balaam, and spake unto him the words of Balak.

022:008 And he said unto them, Lodge here this night, and I will bring
        you word again, as the LORD shall speak unto me: and the
        princes of Moab abode with Balaam.

022:009 And God came unto Balaam, and said, What men are these with
        thee?

022:010 And Balaam said unto God, Balak the son of Zippor, king of
        Moab, hath sent unto me, saying,

022:011 Behold, there is a people come out of Egypt, which covereth
        the face of the earth: come now, curse me them; peradventure I
        shall be able to overcome them, and drive them out.

022:012 And God said unto Balaam, Thou shalt not go with them; thou
        shalt not curse the people: for they are blessed.

022:013 And Balaam rose up in the morning, and said unto the princes
        of Balak, Get you into your land: for the LORD refuseth to
        give me leave to go with you.

022:014 And the princes of Moab rose up, and they went unto Balak, and
        said, Balaam refuseth to come with us.

022:015 And Balak sent yet again princes, more, and more honourable
        than they.

022:016 And they came to Balaam, and said to him, Thus saith Balak the
        son of Zippor, Let nothing, I pray thee, hinder thee from
        coming unto me:

022:017 For I will promote thee unto very great honour, and I will do
        whatsoever thou sayest unto me: come therefore, I pray thee,
        curse me this people.

022:018 And Balaam answered and said unto the servants of Balak, If
        Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I
        cannot go beyond the word of the LORD my God, to do less or
        more.

022:019 Now therefore, I pray you, tarry ye also here this night, that
        I may know what the LORD will say unto me more.

022:020 And God came unto Balaam at night, and said unto him, If the
        men come to call thee, rise up, and go with them; but yet the
        word which I shall say unto thee, that shalt thou do.

022:021 And Balaam rose up in the morning, and saddled his ass, and
        went with the princes of Moab.

022:022 And God's anger was kindled because he went: and the angel of
        the LORD stood in the way for an adversary against him. Now he
        was riding upon his ass, and his two servants were with him.

022:023 And the ass saw the angel of the LORD standing in the way, and
        his sword drawn in his hand: and the ass turned aside out of
        the way, and went into the field: and Balaam smote the ass, to
        turn her into the way.

022:024 But the angel of the LORD stood in a path of the vineyards, a
        wall being on this side, and a wall on that side.

022:025 And when the ass saw the angel of the LORD, she thrust herself
        unto the wall, and crushed Balaam's foot against the wall: and
        he smote her again.

022:026 And the angel of the LORD went further, and stood in a narrow
        place, where was no way to turn either to the right hand or to
        the left.

022:027 And when the ass saw the angel of the LORD, she fell down
        under Balaam: and Balaam's anger was kindled, and he smote the
        ass with a staff.

022:028 And the LORD opened the mouth of the ass, and she said unto
        Balaam, What have I done unto thee, that thou hast smitten me
        these three times?

022:029 And Balaam said unto the ass, Because thou hast mocked me: I
        would there were a sword in mine hand, for now would I kill
        thee.

022:030 And the ass said unto Balaam, Am not I thine ass, upon which
        thou hast ridden ever since I was thine unto this day? was I
        ever wont to do so unto thee? And he said, Nay.

022:031 Then the LORD opened the eyes of Balaam, and he saw the angel
        of the LORD standing in the way, and his sword drawn in his
        hand: and he bowed down his head, and fell flat on his face.

022:032 And the angel of the LORD said unto him, Wherefore hast thou
        smitten thine ass these three times? behold, I went out to
        withstand thee, because thy way is perverse before me:

022:033 And the ass saw me, and turned from me these three times:
        unless she had turned from me, surely now also I had slain
        thee, and saved her alive.

022:034 And Balaam said unto the angel of the LORD, I have sinned; for
        I knew not that thou stoodest in the way against me: now
        therefore, if it displease thee, I will get me back again.

022:035 And the angel of the LORD said unto Balaam, Go with the men:
        but only the word that I shall speak unto thee, that thou
        shalt speak. So Balaam went with the princes of Balak.

022:036 And when Balak heard that Balaam was come, he went out to meet
        him unto a city of Moab, which is in the border of Arnon,
        which is in the utmost coast.

022:037 And Balak said unto Balaam, Did I not earnestly send unto thee
        to call thee? wherefore camest thou not unto me? am I not able
        indeed to promote thee to honour?

022:038 And Balaam said unto Balak, Lo, I am come unto thee: have I
        now any power at all to say any thing? the word that God
        putteth in my mouth, that shall I speak.

022:039 And Balaam went with Balak, and they came unto Kirjathhuzoth.

022:040 And Balak offered oxen and sheep, and sent to Balaam, and to
        the princes that were with him.

022:041 And it came to pass on the morrow, that Balak took Balaam, and
        brought him up into the high places of Baal, that thence he
        might see the utmost part of the people.

023:001 And Balaam said unto Balak, Build me here seven altars, and
        prepare me here seven oxen and seven rams.

023:002 And Balak did as Balaam had spoken; and Balak and Balaam
        offered on every altar a bullock and a ram.

023:003 And Balaam said unto Balak, Stand by thy burnt offering, and I
        will go: peradventure the LORD will come to meet me: and
        whatsoever he sheweth me I will tell thee. And he went to an
        high place.

023:004 And God met Balaam: and he said unto him, I have prepared
        seven altars, and I have offered upon every altar a bullock
        and a ram.

023:005 And the LORD put a word in Balaam's mouth, and said, Return
        unto Balak, and thus thou shalt speak.

023:006 And he returned unto him, and, lo, he stood by his burnt
        sacrifice, he, and all the princes of Moab.

023:007 And he took up his parable, and said, Balak the king of Moab
        hath brought me from Aram, out of the mountains of the east,
        saying, Come, curse me Jacob, and come, defy Israel.

023:008 How shall I curse, whom God hath not cursed? or how shall I
        defy, whom the LORD hath not defied?

023:009 For from the top of the rocks I see him, and from the hills I
        behold him: lo, the people shall dwell alone, and shall not be
        reckoned among the nations.

023:010 Who can count the dust of Jacob, and the number of the fourth
        part of Israel? Let me die the death of the righteous, and let
        my last end be like his!

023:011 And Balak said unto Balaam, What hast thou done unto me? I
        took thee to curse mine enemies, and, behold, thou hast
        blessed them altogether.

023:012 And he answered and said, Must I not take heed to speak that
        which the LORD hath put in my mouth?

023:013 And Balak said unto him, Come, I pray thee, with me unto
        another place, from whence thou mayest see them: thou shalt
        see but the utmost part of them, and shalt not see them all:
        and curse me them from thence.

023:014 And he brought him into the field of Zophim, to the top of
        Pisgah, and built seven altars, and offered a bullock and a
        ram on every altar.

023:015 And he said unto Balak, Stand here by thy burnt offering,
        while I meet the LORD yonder.

023:016 And the LORD met Balaam, and put a word in his mouth, and
        said, Go again unto Balak, and say thus.

023:017 And when he came to him, behold, he stood by his burnt
        offering, and the princes of Moab with him. And Balak said
        unto him, What hath the LORD spoken?

023:018 And he took up his parable, and said, Rise up, Balak, and
        hear; hearken unto me, thou son of Zippor:

023:019 God is not a man, that he should lie; neither the son of man,
        that he should repent: hath he said, and shall he not do it?
        or hath he spoken, and shall he not make it good?

023:020 Behold, I have received commandment to bless: and he hath
        blessed; and I cannot reverse it.

023:021 He hath not beheld iniquity in Jacob, neither hath he seen
        perverseness in Israel: the LORD his God is with him, and the
        shout of a king is among them.

023:022 God brought them out of Egypt; he hath as it were the strength
        of an unicorn.

023:023 Surely there is no enchantment against Jacob, neither is there
        any divination against Israel: according to this time it shall
        be said of Jacob and of Israel, What hath God wrought!

023:024 Behold, the people shall rise up as a great lion, and lift up
        himself as a young lion: he shall not lie down until he eat of
        the prey, and drink the blood of the slain.

023:025 And Balak said unto Balaam, Neither curse them at all, nor
        bless them at all.

023:026 But Balaam answered and said unto Balak, Told not I thee,
        saying, All that the LORD speaketh, that I must do?

023:027 And Balak said unto Balaam, Come, I pray thee, I will bring
        thee unto another place; peradventure it will please God that
        thou mayest curse me them from thence.

023:028 And Balak brought Balaam unto the top of Peor, that looketh
        toward Jeshimon.

023:029 And Balaam said unto Balak, Build me here seven altars, and
        prepare me here seven bullocks and seven rams.

023:030 And Balak did as Balaam had said, and offered a bullock and a
        ram on every altar.

024:001 And when Balaam saw that it pleased the LORD to bless Israel,
        he went not, as at other times, to seek for enchantments, but
        he set his face toward the wilderness.

024:002 And Balaam lifted up his eyes, and he saw Israel abiding in
        his tents according to their tribes; and the spirit of God
        came upon him.

024:003 And he took up his parable, and said, Balaam the son of Beor
        hath said, and the man whose eyes are open hath said:

024:004 He hath said, which heard the words of God, which saw the
        vision of the Almighty, falling into a trance, but having his
        eyes open:

024:005 How goodly are thy tents, O Jacob, and thy tabernacles, O
        Israel!

024:006 As the valleys are they spread forth, as gardens by the
        river's side, as the trees of lign aloes which the LORD hath
        planted, and as cedar trees beside the waters.

024:007 He shall pour the water out of his buckets, and his seed shall
        be in many waters, and his king shall be higher than Agag, and
        his kingdom shall be exalted.

024:008 God brought him forth out of Egypt; he hath as it were the
        strength of an unicorn: he shall eat up the nations his
        enemies, and shall break their bones, and pierce them through
        with his arrows.

024:009 He couched, he lay down as a lion, and as a great lion: who
        shall stir him up? Blessed is he that blesseth thee, and
        cursed is he that curseth thee.

024:010 And Balak's anger was kindled against Balaam, and he smote his
        hands together: and Balak said unto Balaam, I called thee to
        curse mine enemies, and, behold, thou hast altogether blessed
        them these three times.

024:011 Therefore now flee thou to thy place: I thought to promote
        thee unto great honour; but, lo, the LORD hath kept thee back
        from honour.

024:012 And Balaam said unto Balak, Spake I not also to thy messengers
        which thou sentest unto me, saying,

024:013 If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I
        cannot go beyond the commandment of the LORD, to do either
        good or bad of mine own mind; but what the LORD saith, that
        will I speak?

024:014 And now, behold, I go unto my people: come therefore, and I
        will advertise thee what this people shall do to thy people in
        the latter days.

024:015 And he took up his parable, and said, Balaam the son of Beor
        hath said, and the man whose eyes are open hath said:

024:016 He hath said, which heard the words of God, and knew the
        knowledge of the most High, which saw the vision of the
        Almighty, falling into a trance, but having his eyes open:

024:017 I shall see him, but not now: I shall behold him, but not
        nigh: there shall come a Star out of Jacob, and a Sceptre
        shall rise out of Israel, and shall smite the corners of Moab,
        and destroy all the children of Sheth.

024:018 And Edom shall be a possession, Seir also shall be a
        possession for his enemies; and Israel shall do valiantly.

024:019 Out of Jacob shall come he that shall have dominion, and shall
        destroy him that remaineth of the city.

024:020 And when he looked on Amalek, he took up his parable, and
        said, Amalek was the first of the nations; but his latter end
        shall be that he perish for ever.

024:021 And he looked on the Kenites, and took up his parable, and
        said, Strong is thy dwellingplace, and thou puttest thy nest
        in a rock.

024:022 Nevertheless the Kenite shall be wasted, until Asshur shall
        carry thee away captive.

024:023 And he took up his parable, and said, Alas, who shall live
        when God doeth this!

024:024 And ships shall come from the coast of Chittim, and shall
        afflict Asshur, and shall afflict Eber, and he also shall
        perish for ever.

024:025 And Balaam rose up, and went and returned to his place: and
        Balak also went his way.

025:001 And Israel abode in Shittim, and the people began to commit
        whoredom with the daughters of Moab.

025:002 And they called the people unto the sacrifices of their gods:
        and the people did eat, and bowed down to their gods.

025:003 And Israel joined himself unto Baalpeor: and the anger of the
        LORD was kindled against Israel.

025:004 And the LORD said unto Moses, Take all the heads of the
        people, and hang them up before the LORD against the sun, that
        the fierce anger of the LORD may be turned away from Israel.

025:005 And Moses said unto the judges of Israel, Slay ye every one
        his men that were joined unto Baalpeor.

025:006 And, behold, one of the children of Israel came and brought
        unto his brethren a Midianitish woman in the sight of Moses,
        and in the sight of all the congregation of the children of
        Israel, who were weeping before the door of the tabernacle of
        the congregation.

025:007 And when Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the
        priest, saw it, he rose up from among the congregation, and
        took a javelin in his hand;

025:008 And he went after the man of Israel into the tent, and thrust
        both of them through, the man of Israel, and the woman through
        her belly. So the plague was stayed from the children of
        Israel.

025:009 And those that died in the plague were twenty and four
        thousand.

025:010 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

025:011 Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest,
        hath turned my wrath away from the children of Israel, while
        he was zealous for my sake among them, that I consumed not the
        children of Israel in my jealousy.

025:012 Wherefore say, Behold, I give unto him my covenant of peace:

025:013 And he shall have it, and his seed after him, even the
        covenant of an everlasting priesthood; because he was zealous
        for his God, and made an atonement for the children of Israel.

025:014 Now the name of the Israelite that was slain, even that was
        slain with the Midianitish woman, was Zimri, the son of Salu,
        a prince of a chief house among the Simeonites.

025:015 And the name of the Midianitish woman that was slain was
        Cozbi, the daughter of Zur; he was head over a people, and of
        a chief house in Midian.

025:016 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

025:017 Vex the Midianites, and smite them:

025:018 For they vex you with their wiles, wherewith they have
        beguiled you in the matter of Peor, and in the matter of
        Cozbi, the daughter of a prince of Midian, their sister, which
        was slain in the day of the plague for Peor's sake.

026:001 And it came to pass after the plague, that the LORD spake unto
        Moses and unto Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, saying,

026:002 Take the sum of all the congregation of the children of
        Israel, from twenty years old and upward, throughout their
        fathers' house, all that are able to go to war in Israel.

026:003 And Moses and Eleazar the priest spake with them in the plains
        of Moab by Jordan near Jericho, saying,

026:004 Take the sum of the people, from twenty years old and upward;
        as the LORD commanded Moses and the children of Israel, which
        went forth out of the land of Egypt.

026:005 Reuben, the eldest son of Israel: the children of Reuben;
        Hanoch, of whom cometh the family of the Hanochites: of Pallu,
        the family of the Palluites:

        numbered of them were forty and three thousand and seven
        hundred and thirty.

026:008 And the sons of Pallu; Eliab.

026:009 And the sons of Eliab; Nemuel, and Dathan, and Abiram. This is
        that Dathan and Abiram, which were famous in the congregation,
        who strove against Moses and against Aaron in the company of
        Korah, when they strove against the LORD:

026:010 And the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them up together
        with Korah, when that company died, what time the fire
        devoured two hundred and fifty men: and they became a sign.

        shalt give the less inheritance: to every one shall his
        inheritance be given according to those that were numbered of
        him.

026:055 Notwithstanding the land shall be divided by lot: according to

        Korathites. And Kohath begat Amram.

026:059 And the name of Amram's wife was Jochebed, the daughter of
        Levi, whom her mother bare to Levi in Egypt: and she bare unto
        Amram Aaron and Moses, and Miriam their sister.

026:060 And unto Aaron was born Nadab, and Abihu, Eleazar, and
        Ithamar.

026:061 And Nadab and Abihu died, when they offered strange fire
        before the LORD.

026:062 And those that were numbered of them were twenty and three
        thousand, all males from a month old and upward: for they were
        not numbered among the children of Israel, because there was
        no inheritance given them among the children of Israel.

026:063 These are they that were numbered by Moses and Eleazar the
        priest, who numbered the children of Israel in the plains of
        Moab by Jordan near Jericho.

026:064 But among these there was not a man of them whom Moses and
        Aaron the priest numbered, when they numbered the children of
        Israel in the wilderness of Sinai.

026:065 For the LORD had said of them, They shall surely die in the
        wilderness. And there was not left a man of them, save Caleb
        the son of Jephunneh, and Joshua the son of Nun.

027:001 Then came the daughters of Zelophehad, the son of Hepher, the
        son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, of the
        families of Manasseh the son of Joseph: and these are the
        names of his daughters; Mahlah, Noah, and Hoglah, and Milcah,
        and Tirzah.

027:002 And they stood before Moses, and before Eleazar the priest,
        and before the princes and all the congregation, by the door
        of the tabernacle of the congregation, saying,

027:003 Our father died in the wilderness, and he was not in the
        company of them that gathered themselves together against the
        LORD in the company of Korah; but died in his own sin, and had
        no sons.

027:004 Why should the name of our father be done away from among his
        family, because he hath no son? Give unto us therefore a
        possession among the brethren of our father.

027:005 And Moses brought their cause before the LORD.

027:006 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

027:007 The daughters of Zelophehad speak right: thou shalt surely
        give them a possession of an inheritance among their father's
        brethren; and thou shalt cause the inheritance of their father
        to pass unto them.

027:008 And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If a
        man die, and have no son, then ye shall cause his inheritance
        to pass unto his daughter.

027:009 And if he have no daughter, then ye shall give his inheritance
        unto his brethren.

027:010 And if he have no brethren, then ye shall give his inheritance
        unto his father's brethren.

027:011 And if his father have no brethren, then ye shall give his
        inheritance unto his kinsman that is next to him of his
        family, and he shall possess it: and it shall be unto the
        children of Israel a statute of judgment, as the LORD
        commanded Moses.

027:012 And the LORD said unto Moses, Get thee up into this mount
        Abarim, and see the land which I have given unto the children
        of Israel.

027:013 And when thou hast seen it, thou also shalt be gathered unto
        thy people, as Aaron thy brother was gathered.

027:014 For ye rebelled against my commandment in the desert of Zin,
        in the strife of the congregation, to sanctify me at the water
        before their eyes: that is the water of Meribah in Kadesh in
        the wilderness of Zin.

027:015 And Moses spake unto the LORD, saying,

027:016 Let the LORD, the God of the spirits of all flesh, set a man
        over the congregation,

027:017 Which may go out before them, and which may go in before them,
        and which may lead them out, and which may bring them in; that
        the congregation of the LORD be not as sheep which have no
        shepherd.

027:018 And the LORD said unto Moses, Take thee Joshua the son of Nun,
        a man in whom is the spirit, and lay thine hand upon him;

027:019 And set him before Eleazar the priest, and before all the
        congregation; and give him a charge in their sight.

027:020 And thou shalt put some of thine honour upon him, that all the
        congregation of the children of Israel may be obedient.

027:021 And he shall stand before Eleazar the priest, who shall ask
        counsel for him after the judgment of Urim before the LORD: at
        his word shall they go out, and at his word they shall come
        in, both he, and all the children of Israel with him, even all
        the congregation.

027:022 And Moses did as the LORD commanded him: and he took Joshua,
        and set him before Eleazar the priest, and before all the
        congregation:

027:023 And he laid his hands upon him, and gave him a charge, as the
        LORD commanded by the hand of Moses.

028:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

028:002 Command the children of Israel, and say unto them, My
        offering, and my bread for my sacrifices made by fire, for a
        sweet savour unto me, shall ye observe to offer unto me in
        their due season.

028:003 And thou shalt say unto them, This is the offering made by
        fire which ye shall offer unto the LORD; two lambs of the
        first year without spot day by day, for a continual burnt
        offering.

028:004 The one lamb shalt thou offer in the morning, and the other
        lamb shalt thou offer at even;

028:005 And a tenth part of an ephah of flour for a meat offering,
        mingled with the fourth part of an hin of beaten oil.

028:006 It is a continual burnt offering, which was ordained in mount
        Sinai for a sweet savour, a sacrifice made by fire unto the
        LORD.

028:007 And the drink offering thereof shall be the fourth part of an
        hin for the one lamb: in the holy place shalt thou cause the
        strong wine to be poured unto the LORD for a drink offering.

028:008 And the other lamb shalt thou offer at even: as the meat
        offering of the morning, and as the drink offering thereof,
        thou shalt offer it, a sacrifice made by fire, of a sweet
        savour unto the LORD.

028:009 And on the sabbath day two lambs of the first year without
        spot, and two tenth deals of flour for a meat offering,
        mingled with oil, and the drink offering thereof:

028:010 This is the burnt offering of every sabbath, beside the
        continual burnt offering, and his drink offering.

028:011 And in the beginnings of your months ye shall offer a burnt
        offering unto the LORD; two young bullocks, and one ram, seven
        lambs of the first year without spot;

028:012 And three tenth deals of flour for a meat offering, mingled
        with oil, for one bullock; and two tenth deals of flour for a
        meat offering, mingled with oil, for one ram;

028:013 And a several tenth deal of flour mingled with oil for a meat
        offering unto one lamb; for a burnt offering of a sweet
        savour, a sacrifice made by fire unto the LORD.

028:014 And their drink offerings shall be half an hin of wine unto a
        bullock, and the third part of an hin unto a ram, and a fourth
        part of an hin unto a lamb: this is the burnt offering of
        every month throughout the months of the year.

028:015 And one kid of the goats for a sin offering unto the LORD
        shall be offered, beside the continual burnt offering, and his
        drink offering.

028:016 And in the fourteenth day of the first month is the passover
        of the LORD.

028:017 And in the fifteenth day of this month is the feast: seven
        days shall unleavened bread be eaten.

028:018 In the first day shall be an holy convocation; ye shall do no
        manner of servile work therein:

028:019 But ye shall offer a sacrifice made by fire for a burnt
        offering unto the LORD; two young bullocks, and one ram, and
        seven lambs of the first year: they shall be unto you without
        blemish:

028:020 And their meat offering shall be of flour mingled with oil:
        three tenth deals shall ye offer for a bullock, and two tenth
        deals for a ram;

028:021 A several tenth deal shalt thou offer for every lamb,
        throughout the seven lambs:

028:022 And one goat for a sin offering, to make an atonement for you.

028:023 Ye shall offer these beside the burnt offering in the morning,
        which is for a continual burnt offering.

028:024 After this manner ye shall offer daily, throughout the seven
        days, the meat of the sacrifice made by fire, of a sweet
        savour unto the LORD: it shall be offered beside the continual
        burnt offering, and his drink offering.

028:025 And on the seventh day ye shall have an holy convocation; ye
        shall do no servile work.

028:026 Also in the day of the firstfruits, when ye bring a new meat
        offering unto the LORD, after your weeks be out, ye shall have
        an holy convocation; ye shall do no servile work:

028:027 But ye shall offer the burnt offering for a sweet savour unto
        the LORD; two young bullocks, one ram, seven lambs of the
        first year;

028:028 And their meat offering of flour mingled with oil, three tenth
        deals unto one bullock, two tenth deals unto one ram,

028:029 A several tenth deal unto one lamb, throughout the seven
        lambs;

028:030 And one kid of the goats, to make an atonement for you.

028:031 Ye shall offer them beside the continual burnt offering, and
        his meat offering, (they shall be unto you without blemish)
        and their drink offerings.

029:001 And in the seventh month, on the first day of the month, ye
        shall have an holy convocation; ye shall do no servile work:
        it is a day of blowing the trumpets unto you.

029:002 And ye shall offer a burnt offering for a sweet savour unto
        the LORD; one young bullock, one ram, and seven lambs of the
        first year without blemish:

029:003 And their meat offering shall be of flour mingled with oil,
        three tenth deals for a bullock, and two tenth deals for a
        ram,

029:004 And one tenth deal for one lamb, throughout the seven lambs:

029:005 And one kid of the goats for a sin offering, to make an
        atonement for you:

029:006 Beside the burnt offering of the month, and his meat offering,
        and the daily burnt offering, and his meat offering, and their
        drink offerings, according unto their manner, for a sweet
        savour, a sacrifice made by fire unto the LORD.

029:007 And ye shall have on the tenth day of this seventh month an
        holy convocation; and ye shall afflict your souls: ye shall
        not do any work therein:

029:008 But ye shall offer a burnt offering unto the LORD for a sweet
        savour; one young bullock, one ram, and seven lambs of the
        first year; they shall be unto you without blemish:

029:009 And their meat offering shall be of flour mingled with oil,
        three tenth deals to a bullock, and two tenth deals to one
        ram,

029:010 A several tenth deal for one lamb, throughout the seven lambs:

029:011 One kid of the goats for a sin offering; beside the sin
        offering of atonement, and the continual burnt offering, and
        the meat offering of it, and their drink offerings.

029:012 And on the fifteenth day of the seventh month ye shall have an
        holy convocation; ye shall do no servile work, and ye shall
        keep a feast unto the LORD seven days:

029:013 And ye shall offer a burnt offering, a sacrifice made by fire,
        of a sweet savour unto the LORD; thirteen young bullocks, two
        rams, and fourteen lambs of the first year; they shall be
        without blemish:

029:014 And their meat offering shall be of flour mingled with oil,
        three tenth deals unto every bullock of the thirteen bullocks,
        two tenth deals to each ram of the two rams,

029:015 And a several tenth deal to each lamb of the fourteen lambs:

029:016 And one kid of the goats for a sin offering; beside the
        continual burnt offering, his meat offering, and his drink
        offering.

029:017 And on the second day ye shall offer twelve young bullocks,
        two rams, fourteen lambs of the first year without spot:

029:018 And their meat offering and their drink offerings for the
        bullocks, for the rams, and for the lambs, shall be according
        to their number, after the manner:

029:019 And one kid of the goats for a sin offering; beside the
        continual burnt offering, and the meat offering thereof, and
        their drink offerings.

029:020 And on the third day eleven bullocks, two rams, fourteen lambs
        of the first year without blemish;

029:021 And their meat offering and their drink offerings for the
        bullocks, for the rams, and for the lambs, shall be according
        to their number, after the manner:

029:022 And one goat for a sin offering; beside the continual burnt
        offering, and his meat offering, and his drink offering.

029:023 And on the fourth day ten bullocks, two rams, and fourteen
        lambs of the first year without blemish:

029:024 Their meat offering and their drink offerings for the
        bullocks, for the rams, and for the lambs, shall be according
        to their number, after the manner:

029:025 And one kid of the goats for a sin offering; beside the
        continual burnt offering, his meat offering, and his drink
        offering.

029:026 And on the fifth day nine bullocks, two rams, and fourteen
        lambs of the first year without spot:

029:027 And their meat offering and their drink offerings for the
        bullocks, for the rams, and for the lambs, shall be according
        to their number, after the manner:

029:028 And one goat for a sin offering; beside the continual burnt
        offering, and his meat offering, and his drink offering.

029:029 And on the sixth day eight bullocks, two rams, and fourteen
        lambs of the first year without blemish:

029:030 And their meat offering and their drink offerings for the
        bullocks, for the rams, and for the lambs, shall be according
        to their number, after the manner:

029:031 And one goat for a sin offering; beside the continual burnt
        offering, his meat offering, and his drink offering.

029:032 And on the seventh day seven bullocks, two rams, and fourteen
        lambs of the first year without blemish:

029:033 And their meat offering and their drink offerings for the
        bullocks, for the rams, and for the lambs, shall be according
        to their number, after the manner:

029:034 And one goat for a sin offering; beside the continual burnt
        offering, his meat offering, and his drink offering.

029:035 On the eighth day ye shall have a solemn assembly: ye shall do
        no servile work therein:

029:036 But ye shall offer a burnt offering, a sacrifice made by fire,
        of a sweet savour unto the LORD: one bullock, one ram, seven
        lambs of the first year without blemish:

029:037 Their meat offering and their drink offerings for the bullock,
        for the ram, and for the lambs, shall be according to their
        number, after the manner:

029:038 And one goat for a sin offering; beside the continual burnt
        offering, and his meat offering, and his drink offering.

029:039 These things ye shall do unto the LORD in your set feasts,
        beside your vows, and your freewill offerings, for your burnt
        offerings, and for your meat offerings, and for your drink
        offerings, and for your peace offerings.

029:040 And Moses told the children of Israel according to all that
        the LORD commanded Moses.

030:001 And Moses spake unto the heads of the tribes concerning the
        children of Israel, saying, This is the thing which the LORD
        hath commanded.

030:002 If a man vow a vow unto the LORD, or swear an oath to bind his
        soul with a bond; he shall not break his word, he shall do
        according to all that proceedeth out of his mouth.

030:003 If a woman also vow a vow unto the LORD, and bind herself by a
        bond, being in her father's house in her youth;

030:004 And her father hear her vow, and her bond wherewith she hath
        bound her soul, and her father shall hold his peace at her;
        then all her vows shall stand, and every bond wherewith she
        hath bound her soul shall stand.

030:005 But if her father disallow her in the day that he heareth; not
        any of her vows, or of her bonds wherewith she hath bound her
        soul, shall stand: and the LORD shall forgive her, because her
        father disallowed her.

030:006 And if she had at all an husband, when she vowed, or uttered
        ought out of her lips, wherewith she bound her soul;

030:007 And her husband heard it, and held his peace at her in the day
        that he heard it: then her vows shall stand, and her bonds
        wherewith she bound her soul shall stand.

030:008 But if her husband disallowed her on the day that he heard it;
        then he shall make her vow which she vowed, and that which she
        uttered with her lips, wherewith she bound her soul, of none
        effect: and the LORD shall forgive her.

030:009 But every vow of a widow, and of her that is divorced,
        wherewith they have bound their souls, shall stand against
        her.

030:010 And if she vowed in her husband's house, or bound her soul by
        a bond with an oath;

030:011 And her husband heard it, and held his peace at her, and
        disallowed her not: then all her vows shall stand, and every
        bond wherewith she bound her soul shall stand.

030:012 But if her husband hath utterly made them void on the day he
        heard them; then whatsoever proceeded out of her lips
        concerning her vows, or concerning the bond of her soul, shall
        not stand: her husband hath made them void; and the LORD shall
        forgive her.

030:013 Every vow, and every binding oath to afflict the soul, her
        husband may establish it, or her husband may make it void.

030:014 But if her husband altogether hold his peace at her from day
        to day; then he establisheth all her vows, or all her bonds,
        which are upon her: he confirmeth them, because he held his
        peace at her in the day that he heard them.

030:015 But if he shall any ways make them void after that he hath
        heard them; then he shall bear her iniquity.

030:016 These are the statutes, which the LORD commanded Moses,
        between a man and his wife, between the father and his
        daughter, being yet in her youth in her father's house.

031:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

031:002 Avenge the children of Israel of the Midianites: afterward
        shalt thou be gathered unto thy people.

031:003 And Moses spake unto the people, saying, Arm some of
        yourselves unto the war, and let them go against the
        Midianites, and avenge the LORD of Midian.

031:004 Of every tribe a thousand, throughout all the tribes of
        Israel, shall ye send to the war.

031:005 So there were delivered out of the thousands of Israel, a
        thousand of every tribe, twelve thousand armed for war.

031:006 And Moses sent them to the war, a thousand of every tribe,
        them and Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, to the war,
        with the holy instruments, and the trumpets to blow in his
        hand.

031:007 And they warred against the Midianites, as the LORD commanded
        Moses; and they slew all the males.

031:008 And they slew the kings of Midian, beside the rest of them
        that were slain; namely, Evi, and Rekem, and Zur, and Hur, and
        Reba, five kings of Midian: Balaam also the son of Beor they
        slew with the sword.

031:009 And the children of Israel took all the women of Midian
        captives, and their little ones, and took the spoil of all
        their cattle, and all their flocks, and all their goods.

031:010 And they burnt all their cities wherein they dwelt, and all
        their goodly castles, with fire.

031:011 And they took all the spoil, and all the prey, both of men and
        of beasts.

031:012 And they brought the captives, and the prey, and the spoil,
        unto Moses, and Eleazar the priest, and unto the congregation
        of the children of Israel, unto the camp at the plains of
        Moab, which are by Jordan near Jericho.

031:013 And Moses, and Eleazar the priest, and all the princes of the
        congregation, went forth to meet them without the camp.

031:014 And Moses was wroth with the officers of the host, with the
        captains over thousands, and captains over hundreds, which
        came from the battle.

031:015 And Moses said unto them, Have ye saved all the women alive?

031:016 Behold, these caused the children of Israel, through the
        counsel of Balaam, to commit trespass against the LORD in the
        matter of Peor, and there was a plague among the congregation
        of the LORD.

031:017 Now therefore kill every male among the little ones, and kill
        every woman that hath known man by lying with him.

031:018 But all the women children, that have not known a man by lying
        with him, keep alive for yourselves.

031:019 And do ye abide without the camp seven days: whosoever hath
        killed any person, and whosoever hath touched any slain,
        purify both yourselves and your captives on the third day, and
        on the seventh day.

031:020 And purify all your raiment, and all that is made of skins,
        and all work of goats' hair, and all things made of wood.

031:021 And Eleazar the priest said unto the men of war which went to
        the battle, This is the ordinance of the law which the LORD
        commanded Moses;

031:022 Only the gold, and the silver, the brass, the iron, the tin,
        and the lead,

031:023 Every thing that may abide the fire, ye shall make it go
        through the fire, and it shall be clean: nevertheless it shall
        be purified with the water of separation: and all that abideth
        not the fire ye shall make go through the water.

031:024 And ye shall wash your clothes on the seventh day, and ye
        shall be clean, and afterward ye shall come into the camp.

031:025 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

031:026 Take the sum of the prey that was taken, both of man and of
        beast, thou, and Eleazar the priest, and the chief fathers of
        the congregation:

031:027 And divide the prey into two parts; between them that took the
        war upon them, who went out to battle, and between all the
        congregation:

031:028 And levy a tribute unto the LORD of the men of war which went
        out to battle: one soul of five hundred, both of the persons,
        and of the beeves, and of the asses, and of the sheep:

031:029 Take it of their half, and give it unto Eleazar the priest,
        for an heave offering of the LORD.

031:030 And of the children of Israel's half, thou shalt take one
        portion of fifty, of the persons, of the beeves, of the asses,
        and of the flocks, of all manner of beasts, and give them unto
        the Levites, which keep the charge of the tabernacle of the
        LORD.

031:031 And Moses and Eleazar the priest did as the LORD commanded
        Moses.

031:032 And the booty, being the rest of the prey which the men of war
        had caught, was six hundred thousand and seventy thousand and
        five thousand sheep,

031:033 And threescore and twelve thousand beeves,

031:034 And threescore and one thousand asses,

031:035 And thirty and two thousand persons in all, of women that had
        not known man by lying with him.

031:036 And the half, which was the portion of them that went out to
        war, was in number three hundred thousand and seven and thirty
        thousand and five hundred sheep:

031:037 And the LORD's tribute of the sheep was six hundred and
        threescore and fifteen.

031:038 And the beeves were thirty and six thousand; of which the
        LORD's tribute was threescore and twelve.

031:039 And the asses were thirty thousand and five hundred; of which
        the LORD's tribute was threescore and one.

031:040 And the persons were sixteen thousand; of which the LORD's
        tribute was thirty and two persons.

031:041 And Moses gave the tribute, which was the LORD's heave
        offering, unto Eleazar the priest, as the LORD commanded
        Moses.

031:042 And of the children of Israel's half, which Moses divided from
        the men that warred,

031:043 (Now the half that pertained unto the congregation was three
        hundred thousand and thirty thousand and seven thousand and
        five hundred sheep,

031:044 And thirty and six thousand beeves,

031:045 And thirty thousand asses and five hundred,

031:046 And sixteen thousand persons;)

031:047 Even of the children of Israel's half, Moses took one portion
        of fifty, both of man and of beast, and gave them unto the
        Levites, which kept the charge of the tabernacle of the LORD;
        as the LORD commanded Moses.

031:048 And the officers which were over thousands of the host, the
        captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds, came near
        unto Moses:

031:049 And they said unto Moses, Thy servants have taken the sum of
        the men of war which are under our charge, and there lacketh
        not one man of us.

031:050 We have therefore brought an oblation for the LORD, what every
        man hath gotten, of jewels of gold, chains, and bracelets,
        rings, earrings, and tablets, to make an atonement for our
        souls before the LORD.

031:051 And Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of them, even
        all wrought jewels.

031:052 And all the gold of the offering that they offered up to the
        LORD, of the captains of thousands, and of the captains of
        hundreds, was sixteen thousand seven hundred and fifty
        shekels.

031:053 (For the men of war had taken spoil, every man for himself.)

031:054 And Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of the captains
        of thousands and of hundreds, and brought it into the
        tabernacle of the congregation, for a memorial for the
        children of Israel before the LORD.

032:001 Now the children of Reuben and the children of Gad had a very
        great multitude of cattle: and when they saw the land of
        Jazer, and the land of Gilead, that, behold, the place was a
        place for cattle;

032:002 The children of Gad and the children of Reuben came and spake
        unto Moses, and to Eleazar the priest, and unto the princes of
        the congregation, saying,

032:003 Ataroth, and Dibon, and Jazer, and Nimrah, and Heshbon, and
        Elealeh, and Shebam, and Nebo, and Beon,

032:004 Even the country which the LORD smote before the congregation
        of Israel, is a land for cattle, and thy servants have cattle:

032:005 Wherefore, said they, if we have found grace in thy sight, let
        this land be given unto thy servants for a possession, and
        bring us not over Jordan.

032:006 And Moses said unto the children of Gad and to the children of
        Reuben, Shall your brethren go to war, and shall ye sit here?

032:007 And wherefore discourage ye the heart of the children of
        Israel from going over into the land which the LORD hath given
        them?

032:008 Thus did your fathers, when I sent them from Kadeshbarnea to
        see the land.

032:009 For when they went up unto the valley of Eshcol, and saw the
        land, they discouraged the heart of the children of Israel,
        that they should not go into the land which the LORD had given
        them.

032:010 And the LORD's anger was kindled the same time, and he sware,
        saying,

032:011 Surely none of the men that came up out of Egypt, from twenty
        years old and upward, shall see the land which I sware unto
        Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob; because they have not
        wholly followed me:

032:012 Save Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenezite, and Joshua the
        son of Nun: for they have wholly followed the LORD.

032:013 And the LORD's anger was kindled against Israel, and he made
        them wander in the wilderness forty years, until all the
        generation, that had done evil in the sight of the LORD, was
        consumed.

032:014 And, behold, ye are risen up in your fathers' stead, an
        increase of sinful men, to augment yet the fierce anger of the
        LORD toward Israel.

032:015 For if ye turn away from after him, he will yet again leave
        them in the wilderness; and ye shall destroy all this people.

032:016 And they came near unto him, and said, We will build
        sheepfolds here for our cattle, and cities for our little
        ones:

032:017 But we ourselves will go ready armed before the children of
        Israel, until we have brought them unto their place: and our
        little ones shall dwell in the fenced cities because of the
        inhabitants of the land.

032:018 We will not return unto our houses, until the children of
        Israel have inherited every man his inheritance.

032:019 For we will not inherit with them on yonder side Jordan, or
        forward; because our inheritance is fallen to us on this side
        Jordan eastward.

032:020 And Moses said unto them, If ye will do this thing, if ye will
        go armed before the LORD to war,

032:021 And will go all of you armed over Jordan before the LORD,
        until he hath driven out his enemies from before him,

032:022 And the land be subdued before the LORD: then afterward ye
        shall return, and be guiltless before the LORD, and before
        Israel; and this land shall be your possession before the
        LORD.

032:023 But if ye will not do so, behold, ye have sinned against the
        LORD: and be sure your sin will find you out.

032:024 Build you cities for your little ones, and folds for your
        sheep; and do that which hath proceeded out of your mouth.

032:025 And the children of Gad and the children of Reuben spake unto
        Moses, saying, Thy servants will do as my lord commandeth.

032:026 Our little ones, our wives, our flocks, and all our cattle,
        shall be there in the cities of Gilead:

032:027 But thy servants will pass over, every man armed for war,
        before the Lord to battle, as my lord saith.

032:028 So concerning them Moses commanded Eleazar the priest, and
        Joshua the son of Nun, and the chief fathers of the tribes of
        the children of Israel:

032:029 And Moses said unto them, If the children of Gad and the
        children of Reuben will pass with you over Jordan, every man
        armed to battle, before the LORD, and the land shall be
        subdued before you; then ye shall give them the land of Gilead
        for a possession:

032:030 But if they will not pass over with you armed, they shall have
        possessions among you in the land of Canaan.

032:031 And the children of Gad and the children of Reuben answered,
        saying, As the LORD hath said unto thy servants, so will we
        do.

032:032 We will pass over armed before the LORD into the land of
        Canaan, that the possession of our inheritance on this side
        Jordan may be our's.

032:033 And Moses gave unto them, even to the children of Gad, and to
        the children of Reuben, and unto half the tribe of Manasseh
        the son of Joseph, the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites,
        and the kingdom of Og king of Bashan, the land, with the
        cities thereof in the coasts, even the cities of the country
        round about.

032:034 And the children of Gad built Dibon, and Ataroth, and Aroer,

032:035 And Atroth, Shophan, and Jaazer, and Jogbehah,

032:036 And Bethnimrah, and Bethharan, fenced cities: and folds for
        sheep.

032:037 And the children of Reuben built Heshbon, and Elealeh, and
        Kirjathaim,

032:038 And Nebo, and Baalmeon, (their names being changed,) and
        Shibmah: and gave other names unto the cities which they
        builded.

032:039 And the children of Machir the son of Manasseh went to Gilead,
        and took it, and dispossessed the Amorite which was in it.

032:040 And Moses gave Gilead unto Machir the son of Manasseh; and he
        dwelt therein.

032:041 And Jair the son of Manasseh went and took the small towns
        thereof, and called them Havothjair.

032:042 And Nobah went and took Kenath, and the villages thereof, and
        called it Nobah, after his own name.

033:001 These are the journeys of the children of Israel, which went
        forth out of the land of Egypt with their armies under the
        hand of Moses and Aaron.

033:002 And Moses wrote their goings out according to their journeys
        by the commandment of the LORD: and these are their journeys
        according to their goings out.

033:003 And they departed from Rameses in the first month, on the
        fifteenth day of the first month; on the morrow after the
        passover the children of Israel went out with an high hand in
        the sight of all the Egyptians.

033:004 For the Egyptians buried all their firstborn, which the LORD
        had smitten among them: upon their gods also the LORD executed
        judgments.

033:005 And the children of Israel removed from Rameses, and pitched
        in Succoth.

033:006 And they departed from Succoth, and pitched in Etham, which is
        in the edge of the wilderness.

033:007 And they removed from Etham, and turned again unto Pihahiroth,
        which is before Baalzephon: and they pitched before Migdol.

033:008 And they departed from before Pihahiroth, and passed through
        the midst of the sea into the wilderness, and went three days'
        journey in the wilderness of Etham, and pitched in Marah.

033:009 And they removed from Marah, and came unto Elim: and in Elim
        were twelve fountains of water, and threescore and ten palm
        trees; and they pitched there.

033:010 And they removed from Elim, and encamped by the Red sea.

033:011 And they removed from the Red sea, and encamped in the
        wilderness of Sin.

033:012 And they took their journey out of the wilderness of Sin, and
        encamped in Dophkah.

033:013 And they departed from Dophkah, and encamped in Alush.

033:014 And they removed from Alush, and encamped at Rephidim, where
        was no water for the people to drink.

033:015 And they departed from Rephidim, and pitched in the wilderness
        of Sinai.

033:016 And they removed from the desert of Sinai, and pitched at
        Kibrothhattaavah.

033:017 And they departed from Kibrothhattaavah, and encamped at
        Hazeroth.

033:018 And they departed from Hazeroth, and pitched in Rithmah.

033:019 And they departed from Rithmah, and pitched at Rimmonparez.

033:020 And they departed from Rimmonparez, and pitched in Libnah.

033:021 And they removed from Libnah, and pitched at Rissah.

033:022 And they journeyed from Rissah, and pitched in Kehelathah.

033:023 And they went from Kehelathah, and pitched in mount Shapher.

033:024 And they removed from mount Shapher, and encamped in Haradah.

033:025 And they removed from Haradah, and pitched in Makheloth.

033:026 And they removed from Makheloth, and encamped at Tahath.

033:027 And they departed from Tahath, and pitched at Tarah.

033:028 And they removed from Tarah, and pitched in Mithcah.

033:029 And they went from Mithcah, and pitched in Hashmonah.

033:030 And they departed from Hashmonah, and encamped at Moseroth.

033:031 And they departed from Moseroth, and pitched in Benejaakan.

033:032 And they removed from Benejaakan, and encamped at Horhagidgad.

033:033 And they went from Horhagidgad, and pitched in Jotbathah.

033:034 And they removed from Jotbathah, and encamped at Ebronah.

033:035 And they departed from Ebronah, and encamped at Eziongaber.

033:036 And they removed from Eziongaber, and pitched in the
        wilderness of Zin, which is Kadesh.

033:037 And they removed from Kadesh, and pitched in mount Hor, in the
        edge of the land of Edom.

033:038 And Aaron the priest went up into mount Hor at the commandment
        of the LORD, and died there, in the fortieth year after the
        children of Israel were come out of the land of Egypt, in the
        first day of the fifth month.

033:039 And Aaron was an hundred and twenty and three years old when
        he died in mount Hor.

033:040 And king Arad the Canaanite, which dwelt in the south in the
        land of Canaan, heard of the coming of the children of Israel.

033:041 And they departed from mount Hor, and pitched in Zalmonah.

033:042 And they departed from Zalmonah, and pitched in Punon.

033:043 And they departed from Punon, and pitched in Oboth.

033:044 And they departed from Oboth, and pitched in Ijeabarim, in the
        border of Moab.

033:045 And they departed from Iim, and pitched in Dibongad.

033:046 And they removed from Dibongad, and encamped in
        Almondiblathaim.

033:047 And they removed from Almondiblathaim, and pitched in the
        mountains of Abarim, before Nebo.

033:048 And they departed from the mountains of Abarim, and pitched in
        the plains of Moab by Jordan near Jericho.

033:049 And they pitched by Jordan, from Bethjesimoth even unto
        Abelshittim in the plains of Moab.

033:050 And the LORD spake unto Moses in the plains of Moab by Jordan
        near Jericho, saying,

033:051 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye
        are passed over Jordan into the land of Canaan;

033:052 Then ye shall drive out all the inhabitants of the land from
        before you, and destroy all their pictures, and destroy all
        their molten images, and quite pluck down all their high
        places:

033:053 And ye shall dispossess the inhabitants of the land, and dwell
        therein: for I have given you the land to possess it.

033:054 And ye shall divide the land by lot for an inheritance among
        your families: and to the more ye shall give the more
        inheritance, and to the fewer ye shall give the less
        inheritance: every man's inheritance shall be in the place
        where his lot falleth; according to the tribes of your fathers
        ye shall inherit.

033:055 But if ye will not drive out the inhabitants of the land from
        before you; then it shall come to pass, that those which ye
        let remain of them shall be pricks in your eyes, and thorns in
        your sides, and shall vex you in the land wherein ye dwell.

033:056 Moreover it shall come to pass, that I shall do unto you, as I
        thought to do unto them.

034:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

034:002 Command the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye
        come into the land of Canaan; (this is the land that shall
        fall unto you for an inheritance, even the land of Canaan with
        the coasts thereof:)

034:003 Then your south quarter shall be from the wilderness of Zin
        along by the coast of Edom, and your south border shall be the
        outmost coast of the salt sea eastward:

034:004 And your border shall turn from the south to the ascent of
        Akrabbim, and pass on to Zin: and the going forth thereof
        shall be from the south to Kadeshbarnea, and shall go on to
        Hazaraddar, and pass on to Azmon:

034:005 And the border shall fetch a compass from Azmon unto the river
        of Egypt, and the goings out of it shall be at the sea.

034:006 And as for the western border, ye shall even have the great
        sea for a border: this shall be your west border.

034:007 And this shall be your north border: from the great sea ye
        shall point out for you mount Hor:

034:008 From mount Hor ye shall point out your border unto the
        entrance of Hamath; and the goings forth of the border shall
        be to Zedad:

034:009 And the border shall go on to Ziphron, and the goings out of
        it shall be at Hazarenan: this shall be your north border.

034:010 And ye shall point out your east border from Hazarenan to
        Shepham:

034:011 And the coast shall go down from Shepham to Riblah, on the
        east side of Ain; and the border shall descend, and shall
        reach unto the side of the sea of Chinnereth eastward:

034:012 And the border shall go down to Jordan, and the goings out of
        it shall be at the salt sea: this shall be your land with the
        coasts thereof round about.

034:013 And Moses commanded the children of Israel, saying, This is
        the land which ye shall inherit by lot, which the LORD
        commanded to give unto the nine tribes, and to the half tribe:

034:014 For the tribe of the children of Reuben according to the house
        of their fathers, and the tribe of the children of Gad
        according to the house of their fathers, have received their
        inheritance; and half the tribe of Manasseh have received
        their inheritance:

034:015 The two tribes and the half tribe have received their
        inheritance on this side Jordan near Jericho eastward, toward
        the sunrising.

034:016 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

034:017 These are the names of the men which shall divide the land
        unto you: Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun.

034:018 And ye shall take one prince of every tribe, to divide the
        land by inheritance.

034:019 And the names of the men are these: Of the tribe of Judah,
        Caleb the son of Jephunneh.

034:020 And of the tribe of the children of Simeon, Shemuel the son of
        Ammihud.

034:021 Of the tribe of Benjamin, Elidad the son of Chislon.

034:022 And the prince of the tribe of the children of Dan, Bukki the
        son of Jogli.

034:023 The prince of the children of Joseph, for the tribe of the
        children of Manasseh, Hanniel the son of Ephod.

034:024 And the prince of the tribe of the children of Ephraim, Kemuel
        the son of Shiphtan.

034:025 And the prince of the tribe of the children of Zebulun,
        Elizaphan the son of Parnach.

034:026 And the prince of the tribe of the children of Issachar,
        Paltiel the son of Azzan.

034:027 And the prince of the tribe of the children of Asher, Ahihud
        the son of Shelomi.

034:028 And the prince of the tribe of the children of Naphtali,
        Pedahel the son of Ammihud.

034:029 These are they whom the LORD commanded to divide the
        inheritance unto the children of Israel in the land of Canaan.

035:001 And the LORD spake unto Moses in the plains of Moab by Jordan
        near Jericho, saying,

035:002 Command the children of Israel, that they give unto the
        Levites of the inheritance of their possession cities to dwell
        in; and ye shall give also unto the Levites suburbs for the
        cities round about them.

035:003 And the cities shall they have to dwell in; and the suburbs of
        them shall be for their cattle, and for their goods, and for
        all their beasts.

035:004 And the suburbs of the cities, which ye shall give unto the
        Levites, shall reach from the wall of the city and outward a
        thousand cubits round about.

035:005 And ye shall measure from without the city on the east side
        two thousand cubits, and on the south side two thousand
        cubits, and on the west side two thousand cubits, and on the
        north side two thousand cubits; and the city shall be in the
        midst: this shall be to them the suburbs of the cities.

035:006 And among the cities which ye shall give unto the Levites
        there shall be six cities for refuge, which ye shall appoint
        for the manslayer, that he may flee thither: and to them ye
        shall add forty and two cities.

035:007 So all the cities which ye shall give to the Levites shall be
        forty and eight cities: them shall ye give with their suburbs.

035:008 And the cities which ye shall give shall be of the possession
        of the children of Israel: from them that have many ye shall
        give many; but from them that have few ye shall give few:
        every one shall give of his cities unto the Levites according
        to his inheritance which he inheriteth.

035:009 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,

035:010 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye
        be come over Jordan into the land of Canaan;

035:011 Then ye shall appoint you cities to be cities of refuge for
        you; that the slayer may flee thither, which killeth any
        person at unawares.

035:012 And they shall be unto you cities for refuge from the avenger;
        that the manslayer die not, until he stand before the
        congregation in judgment.

035:013 And of these cities which ye shall give six cities shall ye
        have for refuge.

035:014 Ye shall give three cities on this side Jordan, and three
        cities shall ye give in the land of Canaan, which shall be
        cities of refuge.

035:015 These six cities shall be a refuge, both for the children of
        Israel, and for the stranger, and for the sojourner among
        them: that every one that killeth any person unawares may flee
        thither.

035:016 And if he smite him with an instrument of iron, so that he
        die, he is a murderer: the murderer shall surely be put to
        death.

035:017 And if he smite him with throwing a stone, wherewith he may
        die, and he die, he is a murderer: the murderer shall surely
        be put to death.

035:018 Or if he smite him with an hand weapon of wood, wherewith he
        may die, and he die, he is a murderer: the murderer shall
        surely be put to death.

035:019 The revenger of blood himself shall slay the murderer: when he
        meeteth him, he shall slay him.

035:020 But if he thrust him of hatred, or hurl at him by laying of
        wait, that he die;

035:021 Or in enmity smite him with his hand, that he die: he that
        smote him shall surely be put to death; for he is a murderer:
        the revenger of blood shall slay the murderer, when he meeteth
        him.

035:022 But if he thrust him suddenly without enmity, or have cast
        upon him any thing without laying of wait,

035:023 Or with any stone, wherewith a man may die, seeing him not,
        and cast it upon him, that he die, and was not his enemy,
        neither sought his harm:

035:024 Then the congregation shall judge between the slayer and the
        revenger of blood according to these judgments:

035:025 And the congregation shall deliver the slayer out of the hand
        of the revenger of blood, and the congregation shall restore
        him to the city of his refuge, whither he was fled: and he
        shall abide in it unto the death of the high priest, which was
        anointed with the holy oil.

035:026 But if the slayer shall at any time come without the border of
        the city of his refuge, whither he was fled;

035:027 And the revenger of blood find him without the borders of the
        city of his refuge, and the revenger of blood kill the slayer;
        he shall not be guilty of blood:

035:028 Because he should have remained in the city of his refuge
        until the death of the high priest: but after the death of the
        high priest the slayer shall return into the land of his
        possession.

035:029 So these things shall be for a statute of judgment unto you
        throughout your generations in all your dwellings.

035:030 Whoso killeth any person, the murderer shall be put to death
        by the mouth of witnesses: but one witness shall not testify
        against any person to cause him to die.

035:031 Moreover ye shall take no satisfaction for the life of a
        murderer, which is guilty of death: but he shall be surely put
        to death.

035:032 And ye shall take no satisfaction for him that is fled to the
        city of his refuge, that he should come again to dwell in the
        land, until the death of the priest.

035:033 So ye shall not pollute the land wherein ye are: for blood it
        defileth the land: and the land cannot be cleansed of the
        blood that is shed therein, but by the blood of him that shed
        it.

035:034 Defile not therefore the land which ye shall inhabit, wherein
        I dwell: for I the LORD dwell among the children of Israel.

036:001 And the chief fathers of the families of the children of
        Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, of the
        families of the sons of Joseph, came near, and spake before
        Moses, and before the princes, the chief fathers of the
        children of Israel:

036:002 And they said, The LORD commanded my lord to give the land for
        an inheritance by lot to the children of Israel: and my lord
        was commanded by the LORD to give the inheritance of
        Zelophehad our brother unto his daughters.

036:003 And if they be married to any of the sons of the other tribes
        of the children of Israel, then shall their inheritance be
        taken from the inheritance of our fathers, and shall be put to
        the inheritance of the tribe whereunto they are received: so
        shall it be taken from the lot of our inheritance.

036:004 And when the jubile of the children of Israel shall be, then
        shall their inheritance be put unto the inheritance of the
        tribe whereunto they are received: so shall their inheritance
        be taken away from the inheritance of the tribe of our
        fathers.

036:005 And Moses commanded the children of Israel according to the
        word of the LORD, saying, The tribe of the sons of Joseph hath
        said well.

036:006 This is the thing which the LORD doth command concerning the
        daughters of Zelophehad, saying, Let them marry to whom they
        think best; only to the family of the tribe of their father
        shall they marry.

036:007 So shall not the inheritance of the children of Israel remove
        from tribe to tribe: for every one of the children of Israel
        shall keep himself to the inheritance of the tribe of his
        fathers.

036:008 And every daughter, that possesseth an inheritance in any
        tribe of the children of Israel, shall be wife unto one of the
        family of the tribe of her father, that the children of Israel
        may enjoy every man the inheritance of his fathers.

036:009 Neither shall the inheritance remove from one tribe to another
        tribe; but every one of the tribes of the children of Israel
        shall keep himself to his own inheritance.

036:010 Even as the LORD commanded Moses, so did the daughters of
        Zelophehad:

036:011 For Mahlah, Tirzah, and Hoglah, and Milcah, and Noah, the
        daughters of Zelophehad, were married unto their father's
        brothers' sons:

036:012 And they were married into the families of the sons of
        Manasseh the son of Joseph, and their inheritance remained in
        the tribe of the family of their father.

036:013 These are the commandments and the judgments, which the LORD
        commanded by the hand of Moses unto the children of Israel in
        the plains of Moab by Jordan near Jericho.

Book 05	Deuteronomy

001:001 These be the words which Moses spake unto all Israel on this
        side Jordan in the wilderness, in the plain over against the
        Red sea, between Paran, and Tophel, and Laban, and Hazeroth,
        and Dizahab.

001:002 (There are eleven days' journey from Horeb by the way of mount
        Seir unto Kadeshbarnea.)

001:003 And it came to pass in the fortieth year, in the eleventh
        month, on the first day of the month, that Moses spake unto
        the children of Israel, according unto all that the LORD had
        given him in commandment unto them;

001:004 After he had slain Sihon the king of the Amorites, which dwelt
        in Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, which dwelt at Astaroth
        in Edrei:

001:005 On this side Jordan, in the land of Moab, began Moses to
        declare this law, saying,

001:006 The LORD our God spake unto us in Horeb, saying, Ye have dwelt
        long enough in this mount:

001:007 Turn you, and take your journey, and go to the mount of the
        Amorites, and unto all the places nigh thereunto, in the
        plain, in the hills, and in the vale, and in the south, and by
        the sea side, to the land of the Canaanites, and unto Lebanon,
        unto the great river, the river Euphrates.

001:008 Behold, I have set the land before you: go in and possess the
        land which the LORD sware unto your fathers, Abraham, Isaac,
        and Jacob, to give unto them and to their seed after them.

001:009 And I spake unto you at that time, saying, I am not able to
        bear you myself alone:

001:010 The LORD your God hath multiplied you, and, behold, ye are
        this day as the stars of heaven for multitude.

001:011 (The LORD God of your fathers make you a thousand times so
        many more as ye are, and bless you, as he hath promised you!)

001:012 How can I myself alone bear your cumbrance, and your burden,
        and your strife?

001:013 Take you wise men, and understanding, and known among your
        tribes, and I will make them rulers over you.

001:014 And ye answered me, and said, The thing which thou hast spoken
        is good for us to do.

001:015 So I took the chief of your tribes, wise men, and known, and
        made them heads over you, captains over thousands, and
        captains over hundreds, and captains over fifties, and
        captains over tens, and officers among your tribes.

001:016 And I charged your judges at that time, saying, Hear the
        causes between your brethren, and judge righteously between
        every man and his brother, and the stranger that is with him.

001:017 Ye shall not respect persons in judgment; but ye shall hear
        the small as well as the great; ye shall not be afraid of the
        face of man; for the judgment is God's: and the cause that is
        too hard for you, bring it unto me, and I will hear it.

001:018 And I commanded you at that time all the things which ye
        should do.

001:019 And when we departed from Horeb, we went through all that
        great and terrible wilderness, which ye saw by the way of the
        mountain of the Amorites, as the LORD our God commanded us;
        and we came to Kadeshbarnea.

001:020 And I said unto you, Ye are come unto the mountain of the
        Amorites, which the LORD our God doth give unto us.

001:021 Behold, the LORD thy God hath set the land before thee: go up
        and possess it, as the LORD God of thy fathers hath said unto
        thee; fear not, neither be discouraged.

001:022 And ye came near unto me every one of you, and said, We will
        send men before us, and they shall search us out the land, and
        bring us word again by what way we must go up, and into what
        cities we shall come.

001:023 And the saying pleased me well: and I took twelve men of you,
        one of a tribe:

001:024 And they turned and went up into the mountain, and came unto
        the valley of Eshcol, and searched it out.

001:025 And they took of the fruit of the land in their hands, and
        brought it down unto us, and brought us word again, and said,
        It is a good land which the LORD our God doth give us.

001:026 Notwithstanding ye would not go up, but rebelled against the
        commandment of the LORD your God:

001:027 And ye murmured in your tents, and said, Because the LORD
        hated us, he hath brought us forth out of the land of Egypt,
        to deliver us into the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us.

001:028 Whither shall we go up? our brethren have discouraged our
        heart, saying, The people is greater and taller than we; the
        cities are great and walled up to heaven; and moreover we have
        seen the sons of the Anakims there.

001:029 Then I said unto you, Dread not, neither be afraid of them.

001:030 The LORD your God which goeth before you, he shall fight for
        you, according to all that he did for you in Egypt before your
        eyes;

001:031 And in the wilderness, where thou hast seen how that the LORD
        thy God bare thee, as a man doth bear his son, in all the way
        that ye went, until ye came into this place.

001:032 Yet in this thing ye did not believe the LORD your God,

001:033 Who went in the way before you, to search you out a place to
        pitch your tents in, in fire by night, to shew you by what way
        ye should go, and in a cloud by day.

001:034 And the LORD heard the voice of your words, and was wroth, and
        sware, saying,

001:035 Surely there shall not one of these men of this evil
        generation see that good land, which I sware to give unto your
        fathers.

001:036 Save Caleb the son of Jephunneh; he shall see it, and to him
        will I give the land that he hath trodden upon, and to his
        children, because he hath wholly followed the LORD.

001:037 Also the LORD was angry with me for your sakes, saying, Thou
        also shalt not go in thither.

001:038 But Joshua the son of Nun, which standeth before thee, he
        shall go in thither: encourage him: for he shall cause Israel
        to inherit it.

001:039 Moreover your little ones, which ye said should be a prey, and
        your children, which in that day had no knowledge between good
        and evil, they shall go in thither, and unto them will I give
        it, and they shall possess it.

001:040 But as for you, turn you, and take your journey into the
        wilderness by the way of the Red sea.

001:041 Then ye answered and said unto me, We have sinned against the
        LORD, we will go up and fight, according to all that the LORD
        our God commanded us. And when ye had girded on every man his
        weapons of war, ye were ready to go up into the hill.

001:042 And the LORD said unto me, Say unto them. Go not up, neither
        fight; for I am not among you; lest ye be smitten before your
        enemies.

001:043 So I spake unto you; and ye would not hear, but rebelled
        against the commandment of the LORD, and went presumptuously
        up into the hill.

001:044 And the Amorites, which dwelt in that mountain, came out
        against you, and chased you, as bees do, and destroyed you in
        Seir, even unto Hormah.

001:045 And ye returned and wept before the LORD; but the LORD would
        not hearken to your voice, nor give ear unto you.

001:046 So ye abode in Kadesh many days, according unto the days that
        ye abode there.

002:001 Then we turned, and took our journey into the wilderness by
        the way of the Red sea, as the LORD spake unto me: and we
        compassed mount Seir many days.

002:002 And the LORD spake unto me, saying,

002:003 Ye have compassed this mountain long enough: turn you
        northward.

002:004 And command thou the people, saying, Ye are to pass through
        the coast of your brethren the children of Esau, which dwell
        in Seir; and they shall be afraid of you: take ye good heed
        unto yourselves therefore:

002:005 Meddle not with them; for I will not give you of their land,
        no, not so much as a foot breadth; because I have given mount
        Seir unto Esau for a possession.

002:006 Ye shall buy meat of them for money, that ye may eat; and ye
        shall also buy water of them for money, that ye may drink.

002:007 For the LORD thy God hath blessed thee in all the works of thy
        hand: he knoweth thy walking through this great wilderness:
        these forty years the LORD thy God hath been with thee; thou
        hast lacked nothing.

002:008 And when we passed by from our brethren the children of Esau,
        which dwelt in Seir, through the way of the plain from Elath,
        and from Eziongaber, we turned and passed by the way of the
        wilderness of Moab.

002:009 And the LORD said unto me, Distress not the Moabites, neither
        contend with them in battle: for I will not give thee of their
        land for a possession; because I have given Ar unto the
        children of Lot for a possession.

002:010 The Emims dwelt therein in times past, a people great, and
        many, and tall, as the Anakims;

002:011 Which also were accounted giants, as the Anakims; but the
        Moabites called them Emims.

002:012 The Horims also dwelt in Seir beforetime; but the children of
        Esau succeeded them, when they had destroyed them from before
        them, and dwelt in their stead; as Israel did unto the land of
        his possession, which the LORD gave unto them.

002:013 Now rise up, said I, and get you over the brook Zered. And we
        went over the brook Zered.

002:014 And the space in which we came from Kadeshbarnea, until we
        were come over the brook Zered, was thirty and eight years;
        until all the generation of the men of war were wasted out
        from among the host, as the LORD sware unto them.

002:015 For indeed the hand of the LORD was against them, to destroy
        them from among the host, until they were consumed.

002:016 So it came to pass, when all the men of war were consumed and
        dead from among the people,

002:017 That the LORD spake unto me, saying,

002:018 Thou art to pass over through Ar, the coast of Moab, this day:

002:019 And when thou comest nigh over against the children of Ammon,
        distress them not, nor meddle with them: for I will not give
        thee of the land of the children of Ammon any possession;
        because I have given it unto the children of Lot for a
        possession.

002:020 (That also was accounted a land of giants: giants dwelt
        therein in old time; and the Ammonites call them Zamzummims;

002:021 A people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakims; but the
        LORD destroyed them before them; and they succeeded them, and
        dwelt in their stead:

002:022 As he did to the children of Esau, which dwelt in Seir, when
        he destroyed the Horims from before them; and they succeeded
        them, and dwelt in their stead even unto this day:

002:023 And the Avims which dwelt in Hazerim, even unto Azzah, the
        Caphtorims, which came forth out of Caphtor, destroyed them,
        and dwelt in their stead.)

002:024 Rise ye up, take your journey, and pass over the river Arnon:
        behold, I have given into thine hand Sihon the Amorite, king
        of Heshbon, and his land: begin to possess it, and contend
        with him in battle.

002:025 This day will I begin to put the dread of thee and the fear of
        thee upon the nations that are under the whole heaven, who
        shall hear report of thee, and shall tremble, and be in
        anguish because of thee.

002:026 And I sent messengers out of the wilderness of Kedemoth unto
        Sihon king of Heshbon with words of peace, saying,

002:027 Let me pass through thy land: I will go along by the high way,
        I will neither turn unto the right hand nor to the left.

002:028 Thou shalt sell me meat for money, that I may eat; and give me
        water for money, that I may drink: only I will pass through on
        my feet;

002:029 (As the children of Esau which dwell in Seir, and the Moabites
        which dwell in Ar, did unto me;) until I shall pass over
        Jordan into the land which the LORD our God giveth us.

002:030 But Sihon king of Heshbon would not let us pass by him: for
        the LORD thy God hardened his spirit, and made his heart
        obstinate, that he might deliver him into thy hand, as
        appeareth this day.

002:031 And the LORD said unto me, Behold, I have begun to give Sihon
        and his land before thee: begin to possess, that thou mayest
        inherit his land.

002:032 Then Sihon came out against us, he and all his people, to
        fight at Jahaz.

002:033 And the LORD our God delivered him before us; and we smote
        him, and his sons, and all his people.

002:034 And we took all his cities at that time, and utterly destroyed
        the men, and the women, and the little ones, of every city, we
        left none to remain:

002:035 Only the cattle we took for a prey unto ourselves, and the
        spoil of the cities which we took.

002:036 From Aroer, which is by the brink of the river of Arnon, and
        from the city that is by the river, even unto Gilead, there
        was not one city too strong for us: the LORD our God delivered
        all unto us:

002:037 Only unto the land of the children of Ammon thou camest not,
        nor unto any place of the river Jabbok, nor unto the cities in
        the mountains, nor unto whatsoever the LORD our God forbad us.

003:001 Then we turned, and went up the way to Bashan: and Og the king
        of Bashan came out against us, he and all his people, to
        battle at Edrei.

003:002 And the LORD said unto me, Fear him not: for I will deliver
        him, and all his people, and his land, into thy hand; and thou
        shalt do unto him as thou didst unto Sihon king of the
        Amorites, which dwelt at Heshbon.

003:003 So the LORD our God delivered into our hands Og also, the king
        of Bashan, and all his people: and we smote him until none was
        left to him remaining.

003:004 And we took all his cities at that time, there was not a city
        which we took not from them, threescore cities, all the region
        of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan.

003:005 All these cities were fenced with high walls, gates, and bars;
        beside unwalled towns a great many.

003:006 And we utterly destroyed them, as we did unto Sihon king of
        Heshbon, utterly destroying the men, women, and children, of
        every city.

003:007 But all the cattle, and the spoil of the cities, we took for a
        prey to ourselves.

003:008 And we took at that time out of the hand of the two kings of
        the Amorites the land that was on this side Jordan, from the
        river of Arnon unto mount Hermon;

003:009 (Which Hermon the Sidonians call Sirion; and the Amorites call
        it Shenir;)

003:010 All the cities of the plain, and all Gilead, and all Bashan,
        unto Salchah and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan.

003:011 For only Og king of Bashan remained of the remnant of giants;
        behold his bedstead was a bedstead of iron; is it not in
        Rabbath of the children of Ammon? nine cubits was the length
        thereof, and four cubits the breadth of it, after the cubit of
        a man.

003:012 And this land, which we possessed at that time, from Aroer,
        which is by the river Arnon, and half mount Gilead, and the
        cities thereof, gave I unto the Reubenites and to the Gadites.

003:013 And the rest of Gilead, and all Bashan, being the kingdom of
        Og, gave I unto the half tribe of Manasseh; all the region of
        Argob, with all Bashan, which was called the land of giants.

003:014 Jair the son of Manasseh took all the country of Argob unto
        the coasts of Geshuri and Maachathi; and called them after his
        own name, Bashanhavothjair, unto this day.

003:015 And I gave Gilead unto Machir.

003:016 And unto the Reubenites and unto the Gadites I gave from
        Gilead even unto the river Arnon half the valley, and the
        border even unto the river Jabbok, which is the border of the
        children of Ammon;

003:017 The plain also, and Jordan, and the coast thereof, from
        Chinnereth even unto the sea of the plain, even the salt sea,
        under Ashdothpisgah eastward.

003:018 And I commanded you at that time, saying, The LORD your God
        hath given you this land to possess it: ye shall pass over
        armed before your brethren the children of Israel, all that
        are meet for the war.

003:019 But your wives, and your little ones, and your cattle, (for I
        know that ye have much cattle,) shall abide in your cities
        which I have given you;

003:020 Until the LORD have given rest unto your brethren, as well as
        unto you, and until they also possess the land which the LORD
        your God hath given them beyond Jordan: and then shall ye
        return every man unto his possession, which I have given you.

003:021 And I commanded Joshua at that time, saying, Thine eyes have
        seen all that the LORD your God hath done unto these two
        kings: so shall the LORD do unto all the kingdoms whither thou
        passest.

003:022 Ye shall not fear them: for the LORD your God he shall fight
        for you.

003:023 And I besought the LORD at that time, saying,

003:024 O Lord GOD, thou hast begun to shew thy servant thy greatness,
        and thy mighty hand: for what God is there in heaven or in
        earth, that can do according to thy works, and according to
        thy might?

003:025 I pray thee, let me go over, and see the good land that is
        beyond Jordan, that goodly mountain, and Lebanon.

003:026 But the LORD was wroth with me for your sakes, and would not
        hear me: and the LORD said unto me, Let it suffice thee; speak
        no more unto me of this matter.

003:027 Get thee up into the top of Pisgah, and lift up thine eyes
        westward, and northward, and southward, and eastward, and
        behold it with thine eyes: for thou shalt not go over this
        Jordan.

003:028 But charge Joshua, and encourage him, and strengthen him: for
        he shall go over before this people, and he shall cause them
        to inherit the land which thou shalt see.

003:029 So we abode in the valley over against Bethpeor.

004:001 Now therefore hearken, O Israel, unto the statutes and unto
        the judgments, which I teach you, for to do them, that ye may
        live, and go in and possess the land which the LORD God of
        your fathers giveth you.

004:002 Ye shall not add unto the word which I command you, neither
        shall ye diminish ought from it, that ye may keep the
        commandments of the LORD your God which I command you.

004:003 Your eyes have seen what the LORD did because of Baalpeor: for
        all the men that followed Baalpeor, the LORD thy God hath
        destroyed them from among you.

004:004 But ye that did cleave unto the LORD your God are alive every
        one of you this day.

004:005 Behold, I have taught you statutes and judgments, even as the
        LORD my God commanded me, that ye should do so in the land
        whither ye go to possess it.

004:006 Keep therefore and do them; for this is your wisdom and your
        understanding in the sight of the nations, which shall hear
        all these statutes, and say, Surely this great nation is a
        wise and understanding people.

004:007 For what nation is there so great, who hath God so nigh unto
        them, as the LORD our God is in all things that we call upon
        him for?

004:008 And what nation is there so great, that hath statutes and
        judgments so righteous as all this law, which I set before you
        this day?

004:009 Only take heed to thyself, and keep thy soul diligently, lest
        thou forget the things which thine eyes have seen, and lest
        they depart from thy heart all the days of thy life: but teach
        them thy sons, and thy sons' sons;

004:010 Specially the day that thou stoodest before the LORD thy God
        in Horeb, when the LORD said unto me, Gather me the people
        together, and I will make them hear my words, that they may
        learn to fear me all the days that they shall live upon the
        earth, and that they may teach their children.

004:011 And ye came near and stood under the mountain; and the
        mountain burned with fire unto the midst of heaven, with
        darkness, clouds, and thick darkness.

004:012 And the LORD spake unto you out of the midst of the fire: ye
        heard the voice of the words, but saw no similitude; only ye
        heard a voice.

004:013 And he declared unto you his covenant, which he commanded you
        to perform, even ten commandments; and he wrote them upon two
        tables of stone.

004:014 And the LORD commanded me at that time to teach you statutes
        and judgments, that ye might do them in the land whither ye go
        over to possess it.

004:015 Take ye therefore good heed unto yourselves; for ye saw no
        manner of similitude on the day that the LORD spake unto you
        in Horeb out of the midst of the fire:

004:016 Lest ye corrupt yourselves, and make you a graven image, the
        similitude of any figure, the likeness of male or female,

004:017 The likeness of any beast that is on the earth, the likeness
        of any winged fowl that flieth in the air,

004:018 The likeness of any thing that creepeth on the ground, the
        likeness of any fish that is in the waters beneath the earth:

004:019 And lest thou lift up thine eyes unto heaven, and when thou
        seest the sun, and the moon, and the stars, even all the host
        of heaven, shouldest be driven to worship them, and serve
        them, which the LORD thy God hath divided unto all nations
        under the whole heaven.

004:020 But the LORD hath taken you, and brought you forth out of the
        iron furnace, even out of Egypt, to be unto him a people of
        inheritance, as ye are this day.

004:021 Furthermore the LORD was angry with me for your sakes, and
        sware that I should not go over Jordan, and that I should not
        go in unto that good land, which the LORD thy God giveth thee
        for an inheritance:

004:022 But I must die in this land, I must not go over Jordan: but ye
        shall go over, and possess that good land.

004:023 Take heed unto yourselves, lest ye forget the covenant of the
        LORD your God, which he made with you, and make you a graven
        image, or the likeness of any thing, which the LORD thy God
        hath forbidden thee.

004:024 For the LORD thy God is a consuming fire, even a jealous God.

004:025 When thou shalt beget children, and children's children, and
        ye shall have remained long in the land, and shall corrupt
        yourselves, and make a graven image, or the likeness of any
        thing, and shall do evil in the sight of the LORD thy God, to
        provoke him to anger:

004:026 I call heaven and earth to witness against you this day, that
        ye shall soon utterly perish from off the land whereunto ye go
        over Jordan to possess it; ye shall not prolong your days upon
        it, but shall utterly be destroyed.

004:027 And the LORD shall scatter you among the nations, and ye shall
        be left few in number among the heathen, whither the LORD
        shall lead you.

004:028 And there ye shall serve gods, the work of men's hands, wood
        and stone, which neither see, nor hear, nor eat, nor smell.

004:029 But if from thence thou shalt seek the LORD thy God, thou
        shalt find him, if thou seek him with all thy heart and with
        all thy soul.

004:030 When thou art in tribulation, and all these things are come
        upon thee, even in the latter days, if thou turn to the LORD
        thy God, and shalt be obedient unto his voice;

004:031 (For the LORD thy God is a merciful God;) he will not forsake
        thee, neither destroy thee, nor forget the covenant of thy
        fathers which he sware unto them.

004:032 For ask now of the days that are past, which were before thee,
        since the day that God created man upon the earth, and ask
        from the one side of heaven unto the other, whether there hath
        been any such thing as this great thing is, or hath been heard
        like it?

004:033 Did ever people hear the voice of God speaking out of the
        midst of the fire, as thou hast heard, and live?

004:034 Or hath God assayed to go and take him a nation from the midst
        of another nation, by temptations, by signs, and by wonders,
        and by war, and by a mighty hand, and by a stretched out arm,
        and by great terrors, according to all that the LORD your God
        did for you in Egypt before your eyes?

004:035 Unto thee it was shewed, that thou mightest know that the LORD
        he is God; there is none else beside him.

004:036 Out of heaven he made thee to hear his voice, that he might
        instruct thee: and upon earth he shewed thee his great fire;
        and thou heardest his words out of the midst of the fire.

004:037 And because he loved thy fathers, therefore he chose their
        seed after them, and brought thee out in his sight with his
        mighty power out of Egypt;

004:038 To drive out nations from before thee greater and mightier
        than thou art, to bring thee in, to give thee their land for
        an inheritance, as it is this day.

004:039 Know therefore this day, and consider it in thine heart, that
        the LORD he is God in heaven above, and upon the earth
        beneath: there is none else.

004:040 Thou shalt keep therefore his statutes, and his commandments,
        which I command thee this day, that it may go well with thee,
        and with thy children after thee, and that thou mayest prolong
        thy days upon the earth, which the LORD thy God giveth thee,
        for ever.

004:041 Then Moses severed three cities on this side Jordan toward the
        sunrising;

004:042 That the slayer might flee thither, which should kill his
        neighbour unawares, and hated him not in times past; and that
        fleeing unto one of these cities he might live:

004:043 Namely, Bezer in the wilderness, in the plain country, of the
        Reubenites; and Ramoth in Gilead, of the Gadites; and Golan in
        Bashan, of the Manassites.

004:044 And this is the law which Moses set before the children of
        Israel:

004:045 These are the testimonies, and the statutes, and the
        judgments, which Moses spake unto the children of Israel,
        after they came forth out of Egypt.

004:046 On this side Jordan, in the valley over against Bethpeor, in
        the land of Sihon king of the Amorites, who dwelt at Heshbon,
        whom Moses and the children of Israel smote, after they were
        come forth out of Egypt:

004:047 And they possessed his land, and the land of Og king of
        Bashan, two kings of the Amorites, which were on this side
        Jordan toward the sunrising;

004:048 From Aroer, which is by the bank of the river Arnon, even unto
        mount Sion, which is Hermon,

004:049 And all the plain on this side Jordan eastward, even unto the
        sea of the plain, under the springs of Pisgah.

005:001 And Moses called all Israel, and said unto them, Hear, O
        Israel, the statutes and judgments which I speak in your ears
        this day, that ye may learn them, and keep, and do them.

005:002 The LORD our God made a covenant with us in Horeb.

005:003 The LORD made not this covenant with our fathers, but with us,
        even us, who are all of us here alive this day.

005:004 The LORD talked with you face to face in the mount out of the
        midst of the fire,

005:005 (I stood between the LORD and you at that time, to shew you
        the word of the LORD: for ye were afraid by reason of the
        fire, and went not up into the mount;) saying,

005:006 I am the LORD thy God, which brought thee out of the land of
        Egypt, from the house of bondage.

005:007 Thou shalt have none other gods before me.

005:008 Thou shalt not make thee any graven image, or any likeness of
        any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth
        beneath, or that is in the waters beneath the earth:

005:009 Thou shalt not bow down thyself unto them, nor serve them: for
        I the LORD thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of
        the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth
        generation of them that hate me,

005:010 And shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me and keep
        my commandments.

005:011 Thou shalt not take the name of the LORD thy God in vain: for
        the LORD will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in
        vain.

005:012 Keep the sabbath day to sanctify it, as the LORD thy God hath
        commanded thee.

005:013 Six days thou shalt labour, and do all thy work:

005:014 But the seventh day is the sabbath of the LORD thy God: in it
        thou shalt not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy
        daughter, nor thy manservant, nor thy maidservant, nor thine
        ox, nor thine ass, nor any of thy cattle, nor thy stranger
        that is within thy gates; that thy manservant and thy
        maidservant may rest as well as thou.

005:015 And remember that thou wast a servant in the land of Egypt,
        and that the LORD thy God brought thee out thence through a
        mighty hand and by a stretched out arm: therefore the LORD thy
        God commanded thee to keep the sabbath day.

005:016 Honour thy father and thy mother, as the LORD thy God hath
        commanded thee; that thy days may be prolonged, and that it
        may go well with thee, in the land which the LORD thy God
        giveth thee.

005:017 Thou shalt not kill.

005:018 Neither shalt thou commit adultery.

005:019 Neither shalt thou steal.

005:020 Neither shalt thou bear false witness against thy neighbour.

005:021 Neither shalt thou desire thy neighbour's wife, neither shalt
        thou covet thy neighbour's house, his field, or his
        manservant, or his maidservant, his ox, or his ass, or any
        thing that is thy neighbour's.

005:022 These words the LORD spake unto all your assembly in the mount
        out of the midst of the fire, of the cloud, and of the thick
        darkness, with a great voice: and he added no more. And he
        wrote them in two tables of stone, and delivered them unto me.

005:023 And it came to pass, when ye heard the voice out of the midst
        of the darkness, (for the mountain did burn with fire,) that
        ye came near unto me, even all the heads of your tribes, and
        your elders;

005:024 And ye said, Behold, the LORD our God hath shewed us his glory
        and his greatness, and we have heard his voice out of the
        midst of the fire: we have seen this day that God doth talk
        with man, and he liveth.

005:025 Now therefore why should we die? for this great fire will
        consume us: if we hear the voice of the LORD our God any more,
        then we shall die.

005:026 For who is there of all flesh, that hath heard the voice of
        the living God speaking out of the midst of the fire, as we
        have, and lived?

005:027 Go thou near, and hear all that the LORD our God shall say:
        and speak thou unto us all that the LORD our God shall speak
        unto thee; and we will hear it, and do it.

005:028 And the LORD heard the voice of your words, when ye spake unto
        me; and the LORD said unto me, I have heard the voice of the
        words of this people, which they have spoken unto thee: they
        have well said all that they have spoken.

005:029 O that there were such an heart in them, that they would fear
        me, and keep all my commandments always, that it might be well
        with them, and with their children for ever!

005:030 Go say to them, Get you into your tents again.

005:031 But as for thee, stand thou here by me, and I will speak unto
        thee all the commandments, and the statutes, and the
        judgments, which thou shalt teach them, that they may do them
        in the land which I give them to possess it.

005:032 Ye shall observe to do therefore as the LORD your God hath
        commanded you: ye shall not turn aside to the right hand or to
        the left.

005:033 Ye shall walk in all the ways which the LORD your God hath
        commanded you, that ye may live, and that it may be well with
        you, and that ye may prolong your days in the land which ye
        shall possess.

006:001 Now these are the commandments, the statutes, and the
        judgments, which the LORD your God commanded to teach you,
        that ye might do them in the land whither ye go to possess it:

006:002 That thou mightest fear the LORD thy God, to keep all his
        statutes and his commandments, which I command thee, thou, and
        thy son, and thy son's son, all the days of thy life; and that
        thy days may be prolonged.

006:003 Hear therefore, O Israel, and observe to do it; that it may be
        well with thee, and that ye may increase mightily, as the LORD
        God of thy fathers hath promised thee, in the land that
        floweth with milk and honey.

006:004 Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God is one LORD:

006:005 And thou shalt love the LORD thy God with all thine heart, and
        with all thy soul, and with all thy might.

006:006 And these words, which I command thee this day, shall be in
        thine heart:

006:007 And thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children, and
        shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thine house, and when
        thou walkest by the way, and when thou liest down, and when
        thou risest up.

006:008 And thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thine hand, and they
        shall be as frontlets between thine eyes.

006:009 And thou shalt write them upon the posts of thy house, and on
        thy gates.

006:010 And it shall be, when the LORD thy God shall have brought thee
        into the land which he sware unto thy fathers, to Abraham, to
        Isaac, and to Jacob, to give thee great and goodly cities,
        which thou buildedst not,

006:011 And houses full of all good things, which thou filledst not,
        and wells digged, which thou diggedst not, vineyards and olive
        trees, which thou plantedst not; when thou shalt have eaten
        and be full;

006:012 Then beware lest thou forget the LORD, which brought thee
        forth out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage.

006:013 Thou shalt fear the LORD thy God, and serve him, and shalt
        swear by his name.

006:014 Ye shall not go after other gods, of the gods of the people
        which are round about you;

006:015 (For the LORD thy God is a jealous God among you) lest the
        anger of the LORD thy God be kindled against thee, and destroy
        thee from off the face of the earth.

006:016 Ye shall not tempt the LORD your God, as ye tempted him in
        Massah.

006:017 Ye shall diligently keep the commandments of the LORD your
        God, and his testimonies, and his statutes, which he hath
        commanded thee.

006:018 And thou shalt do that which is right and good in the sight of
        the LORD: that it may be well with thee, and that thou mayest
        go in and possess the good land which the LORD sware unto thy
        fathers.

006:019 To cast out all thine enemies from before thee, as the LORD
        hath spoken.

006:020 And when thy son asketh thee in time to come, saying, What
        mean the testimonies, and the statutes, and the judgments,
        which the LORD our God hath commanded you?

006:021 Then thou shalt say unto thy son, We were Pharaoh's bondmen in
        Egypt; and the LORD brought us out of Egypt with a mighty
        hand:

006:022 And the LORD shewed signs and wonders, great and sore, upon
        Egypt, upon Pharaoh, and upon all his household, before our
        eyes:

006:023 And he brought us out from thence, that he might bring us in,
        to give us the land which he sware unto our fathers.

006:024 And the LORD commanded us to do all these statutes, to fear
        the LORD our God, for our good always, that he might preserve
        us alive, as it is at this day.

006:025 And it shall be our righteousness, if we observe to do all
        these commandments before the LORD our God, as he hath
        commanded us.

007:001 When the LORD thy God shall bring thee into the land whither
        thou goest to possess it, and hath cast out many nations
        before thee, the Hittites, and the Girgashites, and the
        Amorites, and the Canaanites, and the Perizzites, and the
        Hivites, and the Jebusites, seven nations greater and mightier
        than thou;

007:002 And when the LORD thy God shall deliver them before thee; thou
        shalt smite them, and utterly destroy them; thou shalt make no
        covenant with them, nor shew mercy unto them:

007:003 Neither shalt thou make marriages with them; thy daughter thou
        shalt not give unto his son, nor his daughter shalt thou take
        unto thy son.

007:004 For they will turn away thy son from following me, that they
        may serve other gods: so will the anger of the LORD be kindled
        against you, and destroy thee suddenly.

007:005 But thus shall ye deal with them; ye shall destroy their
        altars, and break down their images, and cut down their
        groves, and burn their graven images with fire.

007:006 For thou art an holy people unto the LORD thy God: the LORD
        thy God hath chosen thee to be a special people unto himself,
        above all people that are upon the face of the earth.

007:007 The LORD did not set his love upon you, nor choose you,
        because ye were more in number than any people; for ye were
        the fewest of all people:

007:008 But because the LORD loved you, and because he would keep the
        oath which he had sworn unto your fathers, hath the LORD
        brought you out with a mighty hand, and redeemed you out of
        the house of bondmen, from the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt.

007:009 Know therefore that the LORD thy God, he is God, the faithful
        God, which keepeth covenant and mercy with them that love him
        and keep his commandments to a thousand generations;

007:010 And repayeth them that hate him to their face, to destroy
        them: he will not be slack to him that hateth him, he will
        repay him to his face.

007:011 Thou shalt therefore keep the commandments, and the statutes,
        and the judgments, which I command thee this day, to do them.

007:012 Wherefore it shall come to pass, if ye hearken to these
        judgments, and keep, and do them, that the LORD thy God shall
        keep unto thee the covenant and the mercy which he sware unto
        thy fathers:

007:013 And he will love thee, and bless thee, and multiply thee: he
        will also bless the fruit of thy womb, and the fruit of thy
        land, thy corn, and thy wine, and thine oil, the increase of
        thy kine, and the flocks of thy sheep, in the land which he
        sware unto thy fathers to give thee.

007:014 Thou shalt be blessed above all people: there shall not be
        male or female barren among you, or among your cattle.

007:015 And the LORD will take away from thee all sickness, and will
        put none of the evil diseases of Egypt, which thou knowest,
        upon thee; but will lay them upon all them that hate thee.

007:016 And thou shalt consume all the people which the LORD thy God
        shall deliver thee; thine eye shall have no pity upon them:
        neither shalt thou serve their gods; for that will be a snare
        unto thee.

007:017 If thou shalt say in thine heart, These nations are more than
        I; how can I dispossess them?

007:018 Thou shalt not be afraid of them: but shalt well remember what
        the LORD thy God did unto Pharaoh, and unto all Egypt;

007:019 The great temptations which thine eyes saw, and the signs, and
        the wonders, and the mighty hand, and the stretched out arm,
        whereby the LORD thy God brought thee out: so shall the LORD
        thy God do unto all the people of whom thou art afraid.

007:020 Moreover the LORD thy God will send the hornet among them,
        until they that are left, and hide themselves from thee, be
        destroyed.

007:021 Thou shalt not be affrighted at them: for the LORD thy God is
        among you, a mighty God and terrible.

007:022 And the LORD thy God will put out those nations before thee by
        little and little: thou mayest not consume them at once, lest
        the beasts of the field increase upon thee.

007:023 But the LORD thy God shall deliver them unto thee, and shall
        destroy them with a mighty destruction, until they be
        destroyed.

007:024 And he shall deliver their kings into thine hand, and thou
        shalt destroy their name from under heaven: there shall no man
        be able to stand before thee, until thou have destroyed them.

007:025 The graven images of their gods shall ye burn with fire: thou
        shalt not desire the silver or gold that is on them, nor take
        it unto thee, lest thou be snared therin: for it is an
        abomination to the LORD thy God.

007:026 Neither shalt thou bring an abomination into thine house, lest
        thou be a cursed thing like it: but thou shalt utterly detest
        it, and thou shalt utterly abhor it; for it is a cursed thing.

008:001 All the commandments which I command thee this day shall ye
        observe to do, that ye may live, and multiply, and go in and
        possess the land which the LORD sware unto your fathers.

008:002 And thou shalt remember all the way which the LORD thy God led
        thee these forty years in the wilderness, to humble thee, and
        to prove thee, to know what was in thine heart, whether thou
        wouldest keep his commandments, or no.

008:003 And he humbled thee, and suffered thee to hunger, and fed thee
        with manna, which thou knewest not, neither did thy fathers
        know; that he might make thee know that man doth not live by
        bread only, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth
        of the LORD doth man live.

008:004 Thy raiment waxed not old upon thee, neither did thy foot
        swell, these forty years.

008:005 Thou shalt also consider in thine heart, that, as a man
        chasteneth his son, so the LORD thy God chasteneth thee.

008:006 Therefore thou shalt keep the commandments of the LORD thy
        God, to walk in his ways, and to fear him.

008:007 For the LORD thy God bringeth thee into a good land, a land of
        brooks of water, of fountains and depths that spring out of
        valleys and hills;

008:008 A land of wheat, and barley, and vines, and fig trees, and
        pomegranates; a land of oil olive, and honey;

008:009 A land wherein thou shalt eat bread without scarceness, thou
        shalt not lack any thing in it; a land whose stones are iron,
        and out of whose hills thou mayest dig brass.

008:010 When thou hast eaten and art full, then thou shalt bless the
        LORD thy God for the good land which he hath given thee.

008:011 Beware that thou forget not the LORD thy God, in not keeping
        his commandments, and his judgments, and his statutes, which I
        command thee this day:

008:012 Lest when thou hast eaten and art full, and hast built goodly
        houses, and dwelt therein;

008:013 And when thy herds and thy flocks multiply, and thy silver and
        thy gold is multiplied, and all that thou hast is multiplied;

008:014 Then thine heart be lifted up, and thou forget the LORD thy
        God, which brought thee forth out of the land of Egypt, from
        the house of bondage;

008:015 Who led thee through that great and terrible wilderness,
        wherein were fiery serpents, and scorpions, and drought, where
        there was no water; who brought thee forth water out of the
        rock of flint;

008:016 Who fed thee in the wilderness with manna, which thy fathers
        knew not, that he might humble thee, and that he might prove
        thee, to do thee good at thy latter end;

008:017 And thou say in thine heart, My power and the might of mine
        hand hath gotten me this wealth.

008:018 But thou shalt remember the LORD thy God: for it is he that
        giveth thee power to get wealth, that he may establish his
        covenant which he sware unto thy fathers, as it is this day.

008:019 And it shall be, if thou do at all forget the LORD thy God,
        and walk after other gods, and serve them, and worship them, I
        testify against you this day that ye shall surely perish.

008:020 As the nations which the LORD destroyeth before your face, so
        shall ye perish; because ye would not be obedient unto the
        voice of the LORD your God.

009:001 Hear, O Israel: Thou art to pass over Jordan this day, to go
        in to possess nations greater and mightier than thyself,
        cities great and fenced up to heaven,

009:002 A people great and tall, the children of the Anakims, whom
        thou knowest, and of whom thou hast heard say, Who can stand
        before the children of Anak!

009:003 Understand therefore this day, that the LORD thy God is he
        which goeth over before thee; as a consuming fire he shall
        destroy them, and he shall bring them down before thy face: so
        shalt thou drive them out, and destroy them quickly, as the
        LORD hath said unto thee.

009:004 Speak not thou in thine heart, after that the LORD thy God
        hath cast them out from before thee, saying, For my
        righteousness the LORD hath brought me in to possess this
        land: but for the wickedness of these nations the LORD doth
        drive them out from before thee.

009:005 Not for thy righteousness, or for the uprightness of thine
        heart, dost thou go to possess their land: but for the
        wickedness of these nations the LORD thy God doth drive them
        out from before thee, and that he may perform the word which
        the LORD sware unto thy fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.

009:006 Understand therefore, that the LORD thy God giveth thee not
        this good land to possess it for thy righteousness; for thou
        art a stiffnecked people.

009:007 Remember, and forget not, how thou provokedst the LORD thy God
        to wrath in the wilderness: from the day that thou didst
        depart out of the land of Egypt, until ye came unto this
        place, ye have been rebellious against the LORD.

009:008 Also in Horeb ye provoked the LORD to wrath, so that the LORD
        was angry with you to have destroyed you.

009:009 When I was gone up into the mount to receive the tables of
        stone, even the tables of the covenant which the LORD made
        with you, then I abode in the mount forty days and forty
        nights, I neither did eat bread nor drink water:

009:010 And the LORD delivered unto me two tables of stone written
        with the finger of God; and on them was written according to
        all the words, which the LORD spake with you in the mount out
        of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly.

009:011 And it came to pass at the end of forty days and forty nights,
        that the LORD gave me the two tables of stone, even the tables
        of the covenant.

009:012 And the LORD said unto me, Arise, get thee down quickly from
        hence; for thy people which thou hast brought forth out of
        Egypt have corrupted themselves; they are quickly turned aside
        out of the way which I commanded them; they have made them a
        molten image.

009:013 Furthermore the LORD spake unto me, saying, I have seen this
        people, and, behold, it is a stiffnecked people:

009:014 Let me alone, that I may destroy them, and blot out their name
        from under heaven: and I will make of thee a nation mightier
        and greater than they.

009:015 So I turned and came down from the mount, and the mount burned
        with fire: and the two tables of the covenant were in my two
        hands.

009:016 And I looked, and, behold, ye had sinned against the LORD your
        God, and had made you a molten calf: ye had turned aside
        quickly out of the way which the LORD had commanded you.

009:017 And I took the two tables, and cast them out of my two hands,
        and brake them before your eyes.

009:018 And I fell down before the LORD, as at the first, forty days
        and forty nights: I did neither eat bread, nor drink water,
        because of all your sins which ye sinned, in doing wickedly in
        the sight of the LORD, to provoke him to anger.

009:019 For I was afraid of the anger and hot displeasure, wherewith
        the LORD was wroth against you to destroy you. But the LORD
        hearkened unto me at that time also.

009:020 And the LORD was very angry with Aaron to have destroyed him:
        and I prayed for Aaron also the same time.

009:021 And I took your sin, the calf which ye had made, and burnt it
        with fire, and stamped it, and ground it very small, even
        until it was as small as dust: and I cast the dust thereof
        into the brook that descended out of the mount.

009:022 And at Taberah, and at Massah, and at Kibrothhattaavah, ye
        provoked the LORD to wrath.

009:023 Likewise when the LORD sent you from Kadeshbarnea, saying, Go
        up and possess the land which I have given you; then ye
        rebelled against the commandment of the LORD your God, and ye
        believed him not, nor hearkened to his voice.

009:024 Ye have been rebellious against the LORD from the day that I
        knew you.

009:025 Thus I fell down before the LORD forty days and forty nights,
        as I fell down at the first; because the LORD had said he
        would destroy you.

009:026 I prayed therefore unto the LORD, and said, O Lord GOD,
        destroy not thy people and thine inheritance, which thou hast
        redeemed through thy greatness, which thou hast brought forth
        out of Egypt with a mighty hand.

009:027 Remember thy servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; look not
        unto the stubbornness of this people, nor to their wickedness,
        nor to their sin:

009:028 Lest the land whence thou broughtest us out say, Because the
        LORD was not able to bring them into the land which he
        promised them, and because he hated them, he hath brought them
        out to slay them in the wilderness.

009:029 Yet they are thy people and thine inheritance, which thou
        broughtest out by thy mighty power and by thy stretched out
        arm.

010:001 At that time the LORD said unto me, Hew thee two tables of
        stone like unto the first, and come up unto me into the mount,
        and make thee an ark of wood.

010:002 And I will write on the tables the words that were in the
        first tables which thou brakest, and thou shalt put them in
        the ark.

010:003 And I made an ark of shittim wood, and hewed two tables of
        stone like unto the first, and went up into the mount, having
        the two tables in mine hand.

010:004 And he wrote on the tables, according to the first writing,
        the ten commandments, which the LORD spake unto you in the
        mount out of the midst of the fire in the day of the assembly:
        and the LORD gave them unto me.

010:005 And I turned myself and came down from the mount, and put the
        tables in the ark which I had made; and there they be, as the
        LORD commanded me.

010:006 And the children of Israel took their journey from Beeroth of
        the children of Jaakan to Mosera: there Aaron died, and there
        he was buried; and Eleazar his son ministered in the priest's
        office in his stead.

010:007 From thence they journeyed unto Gudgodah; and from Gudgodah to
        Jotbath, a land of rivers of waters.

010:008 At that time the LORD separated the tribe of Levi, to bear the
        ark of the covenant of the LORD, to stand before the LORD to
        minister unto him, and to bless in his name, unto this day.

010:009 Wherefore Levi hath no part nor inheritance with his brethren;
        the LORD is his inheritance, according as the LORD thy God
        promised him.

010:010 And I stayed in the mount, according to the first time, forty
        days and forty nights; and the LORD hearkened unto me at that
        time also, and the LORD would not destroy thee.

010:011 And the LORD said unto me, Arise, take thy journey before the
        people, that they may go in and possess the land, which I
        sware unto their fathers to give unto them.

010:012 And now, Israel, what doth the LORD thy God require of thee,
        but to fear the LORD thy God, to walk in all his ways, and to
        love him, and to serve the LORD thy God with all thy heart and
        with all thy soul,

010:013 To keep the commandments of the LORD, and his statutes, which
        I command thee this day for thy good?

010:014 Behold, the heaven and the heaven of heavens is the LORD's thy
        God, the earth also, with all that therein is.

010:015 Only the LORD had a delight in thy fathers to love them, and
        he chose their seed after them, even you above all people, as
        it is this day.

010:016 Circumcise therefore the foreskin of your heart, and be no
        more stiffnecked.

010:017 For the LORD your God is God of gods, and Lord of lords, a
        great God, a mighty, and a terrible, which regardeth not
        persons, nor taketh reward:

010:018 He doth execute the judgment of the fatherless and widow, and
        loveth the stranger, in giving him food and raiment.

010:019 Love ye therefore the stranger: for ye were strangers in the
        land of Egypt.

010:020 Thou shalt fear the LORD thy God; him shalt thou serve, and to
        him shalt thou cleave, and swear by his name.

010:021 He is thy praise, and he is thy God, that hath done for thee
        these great and terrible things, which thine eyes have seen.

010:022 Thy fathers went down into Egypt with threescore and ten
        persons; and now the LORD thy God hath made thee as the stars
        of heaven for multitude.

011:001 Therefore thou shalt love the LORD thy God, and keep his
        charge, and his statutes, and his judgments, and his
        commandments, alway.

011:002 And know ye this day: for I speak not with your children which
        have not known, and which have not seen the chastisement of
        the LORD your God, his greatness, his mighty hand, and his
        stretched out arm,

011:003 And his miracles, and his acts, which he did in the midst of
        Egypt unto Pharaoh the king of Egypt, and unto all his land;

011:004 And what he did unto the army of Egypt, unto their horses, and
        to their chariots; how he made the water of the Red sea to
        overflow them as they pursued after you, and how the LORD hath
        destroyed them unto this day;

011:005 And what he did unto you in the wilderness, until ye came into
        this place;

011:006 And what he did unto Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, the
        son of Reuben: how the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed
        them up, and their households, and their tents, and all the
        substance that was in their possession, in the midst of all
        Israel:

011:007 But your eyes have seen all the great acts of the LORD which
        he did.

011:008 Therefore shall ye keep all the commandments which I command
        you this day, that ye may be strong, and go in and possess the
        land, whither ye go to possess it;

011:009 And that ye may prolong your days in the land, which the LORD
        sware unto your fathers to give unto them and to their seed, a
        land that floweth with milk and honey.

011:010 For the land, whither thou goest in to possess it, is not as
        the land of Egypt, from whence ye came out, where thou sowedst
        thy seed, and wateredst it with thy foot, as a garden of
        herbs:

011:011 But the land, whither ye go to possess it, is a land of hills
        and valleys, and drinketh water of the rain of heaven:

011:012 A land which the LORD thy God careth for: the eyes of the LORD
        thy God are always upon it, from the beginning of the year
        even unto the end of the year.

011:013 And it shall come to pass, if ye shall hearken diligently unto
        my commandments which I command you this day, to love the LORD
        your God, and to serve him with all your heart and with all
        your soul,

011:014 That I will give you the rain of your land in his due season,
        the first rain and the latter rain, that thou mayest gather in
        thy corn, and thy wine, and thine oil.

011:015 And I will send grass in thy fields for thy cattle, that thou
        mayest eat and be full.

011:016 Take heed to yourselves, that your heart be not deceived, and
        ye turn aside, and serve other gods, and worship them;

011:017 And then the LORD's wrath be kindled against you, and he shut
        up the heaven, that there be no rain, and that the land yield
        not her fruit; and lest ye perish quickly from off the good
        land which the LORD giveth you.

011:018 Therefore shall ye lay up these my words in your heart and in
        your soul, and bind them for a sign upon your hand, that they
        may be as frontlets between your eyes.

011:019 And ye shall teach them your children, speaking of them when
        thou sittest in thine house, and when thou walkest by the way,
        when thou liest down, and when thou risest up.

011:020 And thou shalt write them upon the door posts of thine house,
        and upon thy gates:

011:021 That your days may be multiplied, and the days of your
        children, in the land which the LORD sware unto your fathers
        to give them, as the days of heaven upon the earth.

011:022 For if ye shall diligently keep all these commandments which I
        command you, to do them, to love the LORD your God, to walk in
        all his ways, and to cleave unto him;

011:023 Then will the LORD drive out all these nations from before
        you, and ye shall possess greater nations and mightier than
        yourselves.

011:024 Every place whereon the soles of your feet shall tread shall
        be yours: from the wilderness and Lebanon, from the river, the
        river Euphrates, even unto the uttermost sea shall your coast
        be.

011:025 There shall no man be able to stand before you: for the LORD
        your God shall lay the fear of you and the dread of you upon
        all the land that ye shall tread upon, as he hath said unto
        you.

011:026 Behold, I set before you this day a blessing and a curse;

011:027 A blessing, if ye obey the commandments of the LORD your God,
        which I command you this day:

011:028 And a curse, if ye will not obey the commandments of the LORD
        your God, but turn aside out of the way which I command you
        this day, to go after other gods, which ye have not known.

011:029 And it shall come to pass, when the LORD thy God hath brought
        thee in unto the land whither thou goest to possess it, that
        thou shalt put the blessing upon mount Gerizim, and the curse
        upon mount Ebal.

011:030 Are they not on the other side Jordan, by the way where the
        sun goeth down, in the land of the Canaanites, which dwell in
        the champaign over against Gilgal, beside the plains of Moreh?

011:031 For ye shall pass over Jordan to go in to possess the land
        which the LORD your God giveth you, and ye shall possess it,
        and dwell therein.

011:032 And ye shall observe to do all the statutes and judgments
        which I set before you this day.

012:001 These are the statutes and judgments, which ye shall observe
        to do in the land, which the LORD God of thy fathers giveth
