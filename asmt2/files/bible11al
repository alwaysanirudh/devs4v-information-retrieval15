        do gender strifes.

002:024 And the servant of the Lord must not strive; but be gentle
        unto all men, apt to teach, patient,

002:025 In meekness instructing those that oppose themselves; if God
        peradventure will give them repentance to the acknowledging of
        the truth;

002:026 And that they may recover themselves out of the snare of the
        devil, who are taken captive by him at his will.

003:001 This know also, that in the last days perilous times shall
        come.

003:002 For men shall be lovers of their own selves, covetous,
        boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents,
        unthankful, unholy,

003:003 Without natural affection, trucebreakers, false accusers,
        incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good,

003:004 Traitors, heady, highminded, lovers of pleasures more than
        lovers of God;

003:005 Having a form of godliness, but denying the power thereof:
        from such turn away.

003:006 For of this sort are they which creep into houses, and lead
        captive silly women laden with sins, led away with divers
        lusts,

003:007 Ever learning, and never able to come to the knowledge of the
        truth.

003:008 Now as Jannes and Jambres withstood Moses, so do these also
        resist the truth: men of corrupt minds, reprobate concerning
        the faith.

003:009 But they shall proceed no further: for their folly shall be
        manifest unto all men, as their's also was.

003:010 But thou hast fully known my doctrine, manner of life,
        purpose, faith, longsuffering, charity, patience,

003:011 Persecutions, afflictions, which came unto me at Antioch, at
        Iconium, at Lystra; what persecutions I endured: but out of
        them all the Lord delivered me.

003:012 Yea, and all that will live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer
        persecution.

003:013 But evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse,
        deceiving, and being deceived.

003:014 But continue thou in the things which thou hast learned and
        hast been assured of, knowing of whom thou hast learned them;

003:015 And that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures,
        which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith
        which is in Christ Jesus.

003:016 All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is
        profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for
        instruction in righteousness:

003:017 That the man of God may be perfect, throughly furnished unto
        all good works.

004:001 I charge thee therefore before God, and the Lord Jesus Christ,
        who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and
        his kingdom;

004:002 Preach the word; be instant in season, out of season; reprove,
        rebuke, exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine.

004:003 For the time will come when they will not endure sound
        doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap to
        themselves teachers, having itching ears;

004:004 And they shall turn away their ears from the truth, and shall
        be turned unto fables.

004:005 But watch thou in all things, endure afflictions, do the work
        of an evangelist, make full proof of thy ministry.

004:006 For I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my departure
        is at hand.

004:007 I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have
        kept the faith:

004:008 Henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness,
        which the Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me at that
        day: and not to me only, but unto all them also that love his
        appearing.

004:009 Do thy diligence to come shortly unto me:

004:010 For Demas hath forsaken me, having loved this present world,
        and is departed unto Thessalonica; Crescens to Galatia, Titus
        unto Dalmatia.

004:011 Only Luke is with me. Take Mark, and bring him with thee: for
        he is profitable to me for the ministry.

004:012 And Tychicus have I sent to Ephesus.

004:013 The cloke that I left at Troas with Carpus, when thou comest,
        bring with thee, and the books, but especially the parchments.

004:014 Alexander the coppersmith did me much evil: the Lord reward
        him according to his works:

004:015 Of whom be thou ware also; for he hath greatly withstood our
        words.

004:016 At my first answer no man stood with me, but all men forsook
        me: I pray God that it may not be laid to their charge.

004:017 Notwithstanding the Lord stood with me, and strengthened me;
        that by me the preaching might be fully known, and that all
        the Gentiles might hear: and I was delivered out of the mouth
        of the lion.

004:018 And the Lord shall deliver me from every evil work, and will
        preserve me unto his heavenly kingdom: to whom be glory for
        ever and ever. Amen.

004:019 Salute Prisca and Aquila, and the household of Onesiphorus.

004:020 Erastus abode at Corinth: but Trophimus have I left at Miletum
        sick.

004:021 Do thy diligence to come before winter. Eubulus greeteth thee,
        and Pudens, and Linus, and Claudia, and all the brethren.

004:022 The Lord Jesus Christ be with thy spirit. Grace be with you.
        Amen.

Book 56	Titus

001:001 Paul, a servant of God, and an apostle of Jesus Christ,
        according to the faith of God's elect, and the acknowledging
        of the truth which is after godliness;

001:002 In hope of eternal life, which God, that cannot lie, promised
        before the world began;

001:003 But hath in due times manifested his word through preaching,
        which is committed unto me according to the commandment of God
        our Saviour;

001:004 To Titus, mine own son after the common faith: Grace, mercy,
        and peace, from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ our
        Saviour.

001:005 For this cause left I thee in Crete, that thou shouldest set
        in order the things that are wanting, and ordain elders in
        every city, as I had appointed thee:

001:006 If any be blameless, the husband of one wife, having faithful
        children not accused of riot or unruly.

001:007 For a bishop must be blameless, as the steward of God; not
        selfwilled, not soon angry, not given to wine, no striker, not
        given to filthy lucre;

001:008 But a lover of hospitality, a lover of good men, sober, just,
        holy, temperate;

001:009 Holding fast the faithful word as he hath been taught, that he
        may be able by sound doctrine both to exhort and to convince
        the gainsayers.

001:010 For there are many unruly and vain talkers and deceivers,
        specially they of the circumcision:

001:011 Whose mouths must be stopped, who subvert whole houses,
        teaching things which they ought not, for filthy lucre's sake.

001:012 One of themselves, even a prophet of their own, said, The
        Cretians are alway liars, evil beasts, slow bellies.

001:013 This witness is true. Wherefore rebuke them sharply, that they
        may be sound in the faith;

001:014 Not giving heed to Jewish fables, and commandments of men,
        that turn from the truth.

001:015 Unto the pure all things are pure: but unto them that are
        defiled and unbelieving is nothing pure; but even their mind
        and conscience is defiled.

001:016 They profess that they know God; but in works they deny him,
        being abominable, and disobedient, and unto every good work
        reprobate.

002:001 But speak thou the things which become sound doctrine:

002:002 That the aged men be sober, grave, temperate, sound in faith,
        in charity, in patience.

002:003 The aged women likewise, that they be in behaviour as becometh
        holiness, not false accusers, not given to much wine, teachers
        of good things;

002:004 That they may teach the young women to be sober, to love their
        husbands, to love their children,

002:005 To be discreet, chaste, keepers at home, good, obedient to
        their own husbands, that the word of God be not blasphemed.

002:006 Young men likewise exhort to be sober minded.

002:007 In all things shewing thyself a pattern of good works: in
        doctrine shewing uncorruptness, gravity, sincerity,

002:008 Sound speech, that cannot be condemned; that he that is of the
        contrary part may be ashamed, having no evil thing to say of
        you.

002:009 Exhort servants to be obedient unto their own masters, and to
        please them well in all things; not answering again;

002:010 Not purloining, but shewing all good fidelity; that they may
        adorn the doctrine of God our Saviour in all things.

002:011 For the grace of God that bringeth salvation hath appeared to
        all men,

002:012 Teaching us that, denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, we
        should live soberly, righteously, and godly, in this present
        world;

002:013 Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of
        the great God and our Saviour Jesus Christ;

002:014 Who gave himself for us, that he might redeem us from all
        iniquity, and purify unto himself a peculiar people, zealous
        of good works.

002:015 These things speak, and exhort, and rebuke with all authority.
        Let no man despise thee.

003:001 Put them in mind to be subject to principalities and powers,
        to obey magistrates, to be ready to every good work,

003:002 To speak evil of no man, to be no brawlers, but gentle,
        shewing all meekness unto all men.

003:003 For we ourselves also were sometimes foolish, disobedient,
        deceived, serving divers lusts and pleasures, living in malice
        and envy, hateful, and hating one another.

003:004 But after that the kindness and love of God our Saviour toward
        man appeared,

003:005 Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but
        according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing of
        regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost;

003:006 Which he shed on us abundantly through Jesus Christ our
        Saviour;

003:007 That being justified by his grace, we should be made heirs
        according to the hope of eternal life.

003:008 This is a faithful saying, and these things I will that thou
        affirm constantly, that they which have believed in God might
        be careful to maintain good works. These things are good and
        profitable unto men.

003:009 But avoid foolish questions, and genealogies, and contentions,
        and strivings about the law; for they are unprofitable and
        vain.

003:010 A man that is an heretick after the first and second
        admonition reject;

003:011 Knowing that he that is such is subverted, and sinneth, being
        condemned of himself.

003:012 When I shall send Artemas unto thee, or Tychicus, be diligent
        to come unto me to Nicopolis: for I have determined there to
        winter.

003:013 Bring Zenas the lawyer and Apollos on their journey
        diligently, that nothing be wanting unto them.

003:014 And let our's also learn to maintain good works for necessary
        uses, that they be not unfruitful.

003:015 All that are with me salute thee. Greet them that love us in
        the faith. Grace be with you all. Amen.

Book 57	Philemon

001:001 Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ, and Timothy our brother,
        unto Philemon our dearly beloved, and fellowlabourer,

001:002 And to our beloved Apphia, and Archippus our fellowsoldier,
        and to the church in thy house:

001:003 Grace to you, and peace, from God our Father and the Lord
        Jesus Christ.

001:004 I thank my God, making mention of thee always in my prayers,

001:005 Hearing of thy love and faith, which thou hast toward the Lord
        Jesus, and toward all saints;

001:006 That the communication of thy faith may become effectual by
        the acknowledging of every good thing which is in you in
        Christ Jesus.

001:007 For we have great joy and consolation in thy love, because the
        bowels of the saints are refreshed by thee, brother.

001:008 Wherefore, though I might be much bold in Christ to enjoin
        thee that which is convenient,

001:009 Yet for love's sake I rather beseech thee, being such an one
        as Paul the aged, and now also a prisoner of Jesus Christ.

001:010 I beseech thee for my son Onesimus, whom I have begotten in my
        bonds:

001:011 Which in time past was to thee unprofitable, but now
        profitable to thee and to me:

001:012 Whom I have sent again: thou therefore receive him, that is,
        mine own bowels:

001:013 Whom I would have retained with me, that in thy stead he might
        have ministered unto me in the bonds of the gospel:

001:014 But without thy mind would I do nothing; that thy benefit
        should not be as it were of necessity, but willingly.

001:015 For perhaps he therefore departed for a season, that thou
        shouldest receive him for ever;

001:016 Not now as a servant, but above a servant, a brother beloved,
        specially to me, but how much more unto thee, both in the
        flesh, and in the Lord?

001:017 If thou count me therefore a partner, receive him as myself.

001:018 If he hath wronged thee, or oweth thee ought, put that on mine
        account;

001:019 I Paul have written it with mine own hand, I will repay it:
        albeit I do not say to thee how thou owest unto me even thine
        own self besides.

001:020 Yea, brother, let me have joy of thee in the Lord: refresh my
        bowels in the Lord.

001:021 Having confidence in thy obedience I wrote unto thee, knowing
        that thou wilt also do more than I say.

001:022 But withal prepare me also a lodging: for I trust that through
        your prayers I shall be given unto you.

001:023 There salute thee Epaphras, my fellowprisoner in Christ Jesus;

001:024 Marcus, Aristarchus, Demas, Lucas, my fellowlabourers.

001:025 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. Amen.

Book 58	Hebrews

001:001 God, who at sundry times and in divers manners spake in time
        past unto the fathers by the prophets,

001:002 Hath in these last days spoken unto us by his Son, whom he
        hath appointed heir of all things, by whom also he made the
        worlds;

001:003 Who being the brightness of his glory, and the express image
        of his person, and upholding all things by the word of his
        power, when he had by himself purged our sins, sat down on the
        right hand of the Majesty on high:

001:004 Being made so much better than the angels, as he hath by
        inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they.

001:005 For unto which of the angels said he at any time, Thou art my
        Son, this day have I begotten thee? And again, I will be to
        him a Father, and he shall be to me a Son?

001:006 And again, when he bringeth in the firstbegotten into the
        world, he saith, And let all the angels of God worship him.

001:007 And of the angels he saith, Who maketh his angels spirits, and
        his ministers a flame of fire.

001:008 But unto the Son he saith, Thy throne, O God, is for ever and
        ever: a sceptre of righteousness is the sceptre of thy
        kingdom.

001:009 Thou hast loved righteousness, and hated iniquity; therefore
        God, even thy God, hath anointed thee with the oil of gladness
        above thy fellows.

001:010 And, Thou, Lord, in the beginning hast laid the foundation of
        the earth; and the heavens are the works of thine hands:

001:011 They shall perish; but thou remainest; and they all shall wax
        old as doth a garment;

001:012 And as a vesture shalt thou fold them up, and they shall be
        changed: but thou art the same, and thy years shall not fail.

001:013 But to which of the angels said he at any time, Sit on my
        right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footstool?

001:014 Are they not all ministering spirits, sent forth to minister
        for them who shall be heirs of salvation?

002:001 Therefore we ought to give the more earnest heed to the things
        which we have heard, lest at any time we should let them slip.

002:002 For if the word spoken by angels was stedfast, and every
        transgression and disobedience received a just recompence of
        reward;

002:003 How shall we escape, if we neglect so great salvation; which
        at the first began to be spoken by the Lord, and was confirmed
        unto us by them that heard him;

002:004 God also bearing them witness, both with signs and wonders,
        and with divers miracles, and gifts of the Holy Ghost,
        according to his own will?

002:005 For unto the angels hath he not put in subjection the world to
        come, whereof we speak.

002:006 But one in a certain place testified, saying, What is man,
        that thou art mindful of him? or the son of man that thou
        visitest him?

002:007 Thou madest him a little lower than the angels; thou crownedst
        him with glory and honour, and didst set him over the works of
        thy hands:

002:008 Thou hast put all things in subjection under his feet. For in
        that he put all in subjection under him, he left nothing that
        is not put under him. But now we see not yet all things put
        under him.

002:009 But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels
        for the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honour;
        that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man.

002:010 For it became him, for whom are all things, and by whom are
        all things, in bringing many sons unto glory, to make the
        captain of their salvation perfect through sufferings.

002:011 For both he that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified are
        all of one: for which cause he is not ashamed to call them
        brethren,

002:012 Saying, I will declare thy name unto my brethren, in the midst
        of the church will I sing praise unto thee.

002:013 And again, I will put my trust in him. And again, Behold I and
        the children which God hath given me.

002:014 Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and
        blood, he also himself likewise took part of the same; that
        through death he might destroy him that had the power of
        death, that is, the devil;

002:015 And deliver them who through fear of death were all their
        lifetime subject to bondage.

002:016 For verily he took not on him the nature of angels; but he
        took on him the seed of Abraham.

002:017 Wherefore in all things it behoved him to be made like unto
        his brethren, that he might be a merciful and faithful high
        priest in things pertaining to God, to make reconciliation for
        the sins of the people.

002:018 For in that he himself hath suffered being tempted, he is able
        to succour them that are tempted.

003:001 Wherefore, holy brethren, partakers of the heavenly calling,
        consider the Apostle and High Priest of our profession, Christ
        Jesus;

003:002 Who was faithful to him that appointed him, as also Moses was
        faithful in all his house.

003:003 For this man was counted worthy of more glory than Moses,
        inasmuch as he who hath builded the house hath more honour
        than the house.

003:004 For every house is builded by some man; but he that built all
        things is God.

003:005 And Moses verily was faithful in all his house, as a servant,
        for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken after;

003:006 But Christ as a son over his own house; whose house are we, if
        we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm
        unto the end.

003:007 Wherefore (as the Holy Ghost saith, To day if ye will hear his
        voice,

003:008 Harden not your hearts, as in the provocation, in the day of
        temptation in the wilderness:

003:009 When your fathers tempted me, proved me, and saw my works
        forty years.

003:010 Wherefore I was grieved with that generation, and said, They
        do alway err in their heart; and they have not known my ways.

003:011 So I sware in my wrath, They shall not enter into my rest.)

003:012 Take heed, brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil heart
        of unbelief, in departing from the living God.

003:013 But exhort one another daily, while it is called To day; lest
        any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin.

003:014 For we are made partakers of Christ, if we hold the beginning
        of our confidence stedfast unto the end;

003:015 While it is said, To day if ye will hear his voice, harden not
        your hearts, as in the provocation.

003:016 For some, when they had heard, did provoke: howbeit not all
        that came out of Egypt by Moses.

003:017 But with whom was he grieved forty years? was it not with them
        that had sinned, whose carcases fell in the wilderness?

003:018 And to whom sware he that they should not enter into his rest,
        but to them that believed not?

003:019 So we see that they could not enter in because of unbelief.

004:001 Let us therefore fear, lest, a promise being left us of
        entering into his rest, any of you should seem to come short
        of it.

004:002 For unto us was the gospel preached, as well as unto them: but
        the word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with
        faith in them that heard it.

004:003 For we which have believed do enter into rest, as he said, As
        I have sworn in my wrath, if they shall enter into my rest:
        although the works were finished from the foundation of the
        world.

004:004 For he spake in a certain place of the seventh day on this
        wise, And God did rest the seventh day from all his works.

004:005 And in this place again, If they shall enter into my rest.

004:006 Seeing therefore it remaineth that some must enter therein,
        and they to whom it was first preached entered not in because
        of unbelief:

004:007 Again, he limiteth a certain day, saying in David, To day,
        after so long a time; as it is said, To day if ye will hear
        his voice, harden not your hearts.

004:008 For if Jesus had given them rest, then would he not afterward
        have spoken of another day.

004:009 There remaineth therefore a rest to the people of God.

004:010 For he that is entered into his rest, he also hath ceased from
        his own works, as God did from his.

004:011 Let us labour therefore to enter into that rest, lest any man
        fall after the same example of unbelief.

004:012 For the word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than
        any twoedged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of
        soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a
        discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart.

004:013 Neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his
        sight: but all things are naked and opened unto the eyes of
        him with whom we have to do.

004:014 Seeing then that we have a great high priest, that is passed
        into the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us hold fast our
        profession.

004:015 For we have not an high priest which cannot be touched with
        the feeling of our infirmities; but was in all points tempted
        like as we are, yet without sin.

004:016 Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace, that we
        may obtain mercy, and find grace to help in time of need.

005:001 For every high priest taken from among men is ordained for men
        in things pertaining to God, that he may offer both gifts and
        sacrifices for sins:

005:002 Who can have compassion on the ignorant, and on them that are
        out of the way; for that he himself also is compassed with
        infirmity.

005:003 And by reason hereof he ought, as for the people, so also for
        himself, to offer for sins.

005:004 And no man taketh this honour unto himself, but he that is
        called of God, as was Aaron.

005:005 So also Christ glorified not himself to be made an high
        priest; but he that said unto him, Thou art my Son, to day
        have I begotten thee.

005:006 As he saith also in another place, Thou art a priest for ever
        after the order of Melchisedec.

005:007 Who in the days of his flesh, when he had offered up prayers
        and supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that
        was able to save him from death, and was heard in that he
        feared;

005:008 Though he were a Son, yet learned he obedience by the things
        which he suffered;

005:009 And being made perfect, he became the author of eternal
        salvation unto all them that obey him;

005:010 Called of God an high priest after the order of Melchisedec.

005:011 Of whom we have many things to say, and hard to be uttered,
        seeing ye are dull of hearing.

005:012 For when for the time ye ought to be teachers, ye have need
        that one teach you again which be the first principles of the
        oracles of God; and are become such as have need of milk, and
        not of strong meat.

005:013 For every one that useth milk is unskilful in the word of
        righteousness: for he is a babe.

005:014 But strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age, even
        those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to
        discern both good and evil.

006:001 Therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ,
        let us go on unto perfection; not laying again the foundation
        of repentance from dead works, and of faith toward God,

006:002 Of the doctrine of baptisms, and of laying on of hands, and of
        resurrection of the dead, and of eternal judgment.

006:003 And this will we do, if God permit.

006:004 For it is impossible for those who were once enlightened, and
        have tasted of the heavenly gift, and were made partakers of
        the Holy Ghost,

006:005 And have tasted the good word of God, and the powers of the
        world to come,

006:006 If they shall fall away, to renew them again unto repentance;
        seeing they crucify to themselves the Son of God afresh, and
        put him to an open shame.

006:007 For the earth which drinketh in the rain that cometh oft upon
        it, and bringeth forth herbs meet for them by whom it is
        dressed, receiveth blessing from God:

006:008 But that which beareth thorns and briers is rejected, and is
        nigh unto cursing; whose end is to be burned.

006:009 But, beloved, we are persuaded better things of you, and
        things that accompany salvation, though we thus speak.

006:010 For God is not unrighteous to forget your work and labour of
        love, which ye have shewed toward his name, in that ye have
        ministered to the saints, and do minister.

006:011 And we desire that every one of you do shew the same diligence
        to the full assurance of hope unto the end:

006:012 That ye be not slothful, but followers of them who through
        faith and patience inherit the promises.

006:013 For when God made promise to Abraham, because he could swear
        by no greater, he sware by himself,

006:014 Saying, Surely blessing I will bless thee, and multiplying I
        will multiply thee.

006:015 And so, after he had patiently endured, he obtained the
        promise.

006:016 For men verily swear by the greater: and an oath for
        confirmation is to them an end of all strife.

006:017 Wherein God, willing more abundantly to shew unto the heirs of
        promise the immutability of his counsel, confirmed it by an
        oath:

006:018 That by two immutable things, in which it was impossible for
        God to lie, we might have a strong consolation, who have fled
        for refuge to lay hold upon the hope set before us:

006:019 Which hope we have as an anchor of the soul, both sure and
        stedfast, and which entereth into that within the veil;

006:020 Whither the forerunner is for us entered, even Jesus, made an
        high priest for ever after the order of Melchisedec.

007:001 For this Melchisedec, king of Salem, priest of the most high
        God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the
        kings, and blessed him;

007:002 To whom also Abraham gave a tenth part of all; first being by
        interpretation King of righteousness, and after that also King
        of Salem, which is, King of peace;

007:003 Without father, without mother, without descent, having
        neither beginning of days, nor end of life; but made like unto
        the Son of God; abideth a priest continually.

007:004 Now consider how great this man was, unto whom even the
        patriarch Abraham gave the tenth of the spoils.

007:005 And verily they that are of the sons of Levi, who receive the
        office of the priesthood, have a commandment to take tithes of
        the people according to the law, that is, of their brethren,
        though they come out of the loins of Abraham:

007:006 But he whose descent is not counted from them received tithes
        of Abraham, and blessed him that had the promises.

007:007 And without all contradiction the less is blessed of the
        better.

007:008 And here men that die receive tithes; but there he receiveth
        them, of whom it is witnessed that he liveth.

007:009 And as I may so say, Levi also, who receiveth tithes, payed
        tithes in Abraham.

007:010 For he was yet in the loins of his father, when Melchisedec
        met him.

007:011 If therefore perfection were by the Levitical priesthood, (for
        under it the people received the law,) what further need was
        there that another priest should rise after the order of
        Melchisedec, and not be called after the order of Aaron?

007:012 For the priesthood being changed, there is made of necessity a
        change also of the law.

007:013 For he of whom these things are spoken pertaineth to another
        tribe, of which no man gave attendance at the altar.

007:014 For it is evident that our Lord sprang out of Juda; of which
        tribe Moses spake nothing concerning priesthood.

007:015 And it is yet far more evident: for that after the similitude
        of Melchisedec there ariseth another priest,

007:016 Who is made, not after the law of a carnal commandment, but
        after the power of an endless life.

007:017 For he testifieth, Thou art a priest for ever after the order
        of Melchisedec.

007:018 For there is verily a disannulling of the commandment going
        before for the weakness and unprofitableness thereof.

007:019 For the law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a
        better hope did; by the which we draw nigh unto God.

007:020 And inasmuch as not without an oath he was made priest:

007:021 (For those priests were made without an oath; but this with an
        oath by him that said unto him, The Lord sware and will not
        repent, Thou art a priest for ever after the order of
        Melchisedec:)

007:022 By so much was Jesus made a surety of a better testament.

007:023 And they truly were many priests, because they were not
        suffered to continue by reason of death:

007:024 But this man, because he continueth ever, hath an unchangeable
        priesthood.

007:025 Wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that
        come unto God by him, seeing he ever liveth to make
        intercession for them.

007:026 For such an high priest became us, who is holy, harmless,
        undefiled, separate from sinners, and made higher than the
        heavens;

007:027 Who needeth not daily, as those high priests, to offer up
        sacrifice, first for his own sins, and then for the people's:
        for this he did once, when he offered up himself.

007:028 For the law maketh men high priests which have infirmity; but
        the word of the oath, which was since the law, maketh the Son,
        who is consecrated for evermore.

008:001 Now of the things which we have spoken this is the sum: We
        have such an high priest, who is set on the right hand of the
        throne of the Majesty in the heavens;

008:002 A minister of the sanctuary, and of the true tabernacle, which
        the Lord pitched, and not man.

008:003 For every high priest is ordained to offer gifts and
        sacrifices: wherefore it is of necessity that this man have
        somewhat also to offer.

008:004 For if he were on earth, he should not be a priest, seeing
        that there are priests that offer gifts according to the law:

008:005 Who serve unto the example and shadow of heavenly things, as
        Moses was admonished of God when he was about to make the
        tabernacle: for, See, saith he, that thou make all things
        according to the pattern shewed to thee in the mount.

008:006 But now hath he obtained a more excellent ministry, by how
        much also he is the mediator of a better covenant, which was
        established upon better promises.

008:007 For if that first covenant had been faultless, then should no
        place have been sought for the second.

008:008 For finding fault with them, he saith, Behold, the days come,
        saith the Lord, when I will make a new covenant with the house
        of Israel and with the house of Judah:

008:009 Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers
        in the day when I took them by the hand to lead them out of
        the land of Egypt; because they continued not in my covenant,
        and I regarded them not, saith the Lord.

008:010 For this is the covenant that I will make with the house of
        Israel after those days, saith the Lord; I will put my laws
        into their mind, and write them in their hearts: and I will be
        to them a God, and they shall be to me a people:

008:011 And they shall not teach every man his neighbour, and every
        man his brother, saying, Know the Lord: for all shall know me,
        from the least to the greatest.

008:012 For I will be merciful to their unrighteousness, and their
        sins and their iniquities will I remember no more.

008:013 In that he saith, A new covenant, he hath made the first old.
        Now that which decayeth and waxeth old is ready to vanish
        away.

009:001 Then verily the first covenant had also ordinances of divine
        service, and a worldly sanctuary.

009:002 For there was a tabernacle made; the first, wherein was the
        candlestick, and the table, and the shewbread; which is called
        the sanctuary.

009:003 And after the second veil, the tabernacle which is called the
        Holiest of all;

009:004 Which had the golden censer, and the ark of the covenant
        overlaid round about with gold, wherein was the golden pot
        that had manna, and Aaron's rod that budded, and the tables of
        the covenant;

009:005 And over it the cherubims of glory shadowing the mercyseat; of
        which we cannot now speak particularly.

009:006 Now when these things were thus ordained, the priests went
        always into the first tabernacle, accomplishing the service of
        God.

009:007 But into the second went the high priest alone once every
        year, not without blood, which he offered for himself, and for
        the errors of the people:

009:008 The Holy Ghost this signifying, that the way into the holiest
        of all was not yet made manifest, while as the first
        tabernacle was yet standing:

009:009 Which was a figure for the time then present, in which were
        offered both gifts and sacrifices, that could not make him
        that did the service perfect, as pertaining to the conscience;

009:010 Which stood only in meats and drinks, and divers washings, and
        carnal ordinances, imposed on them until the time of
        reformation.

009:011 But Christ being come an high priest of good things to come,
        by a greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands,
        that is to say, not of this building;

009:012 Neither by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood
        he entered in once into the holy place, having obtained
        eternal redemption for us.

009:013 For if the blood of bulls and of goats, and the ashes of an
        heifer sprinkling the unclean, sanctifieth to the purifying of
        the flesh:

009:014 How much more shall the blood of Christ, who through the
        eternal Spirit offered himself without spot to God, purge your
        conscience from dead works to serve the living God?

009:015 And for this cause he is the mediator of the new testament,
        that by means of death, for the redemption of the
        transgressions that were under the first testament, they which
        are called might receive the promise of eternal inheritance.

009:016 For where a testament is, there must also of necessity be the
        death of the testator.

009:017 For a testament is of force after men are dead: otherwise it
        is of no strength at all while the testator liveth.

009:018 Whereupon neither the first testament was dedicated without
        blood.

009:019 For when Moses had spoken every precept to all the people
        according to the law, he took the blood of calves and of
        goats, with water, and scarlet wool, and hyssop, and sprinkled
        both the book, and all the people,

009:020 Saying, This is the blood of the testament which God hath
        enjoined unto you.

009:021 Moreover he sprinkled with blood both the tabernacle, and all
        the vessels of the ministry.

009:022 And almost all things are by the law purged with blood; and
        without shedding of blood is no remission.

009:023 It was therefore necessary that the patterns of things in the
        heavens should be purified with these; but the heavenly things
        themselves with better sacrifices than these.

009:024 For Christ is not entered into the holy places made with
        hands, which are the figures of the true; but into heaven
        itself, now to appear in the presence of God for us:

009:025 Nor yet that he should offer himself often, as the high priest
        entereth into the holy place every year with blood of others;

009:026 For then must he often have suffered since the foundation of
        the world: but now once in the end of the world hath he
        appeared to put away sin by the sacrifice of himself.

009:027 And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this
        the judgment:

009:028 So Christ was once offered to bear the sins of many; and unto
        them that look for him shall he appear the second time without
        sin unto salvation.

010:001 For the law having a shadow of good things to come, and not
        the very image of the things, can never with those sacrifices
        which they offered year by year continually make the comers
        thereunto perfect.

010:002 For then would they not have ceased to be offered? because
        that the worshippers once purged should have had no more
        conscience of sins.

010:003 But in those sacrifices there is a remembrance again made of
        sins every year.

010:004 For it is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats
        should take away sins.

010:005 Wherefore when he cometh into the world, he saith, Sacrifice
        and offering thou wouldest not, but a body hast thou prepared
        me:

010:006 In burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin thou hast had no
        pleasure.

010:007 Then said I, Lo, I come (in the volume of the book it is
        written of me,) to do thy will, O God.

010:008 Above when he said, Sacrifice and offering and burnt offerings
        and offering for sin thou wouldest not, neither hadst pleasure
        therein; which are offered by the law;

010:009 Then said he, Lo, I come to do thy will, O God. He taketh away
        the first, that he may establish the second.

010:010 By the which will we are sanctified through the offering of
        the body of Jesus Christ once for all.

010:011 And every priest standeth daily ministering and offering
        oftentimes the same sacrifices, which can never take away
        sins:

010:012 But this man, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins for
        ever, sat down on the right hand of God;

010:013 From henceforth expecting till his enemies be made his
        footstool.

010:014 For by one offering he hath perfected for ever them that are
        sanctified.

010:015 Whereof the Holy Ghost also is a witness to us: for after that
        he had said before,

010:016 This is the covenant that I will make with them after those
        days, saith the Lord, I will put my laws into their hearts,
        and in their minds will I write them;

010:017 And their sins and iniquities will I remember no more.

010:018 Now where remission of these is, there is no more offering for
        sin.

010:019 Having therefore, brethren, boldness to enter into the holiest
        by the blood of Jesus,

010:020 By a new and living way, which he hath consecrated for us,
        through the veil, that is to say, his flesh;

010:021 And having an high priest over the house of God;

010:022 Let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of faith,
        having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience, and our
        bodies washed with pure water.

010:023 Let us hold fast the profession of our faith without wavering;
        (for he is faithful that promised;)

010:024 And let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to
        good works:

010:025 Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the
        manner of some is; but exhorting one another: and so much the
        more, as ye see the day approaching.

010:026 For if we sin wilfully after that we have received the
        knowledge of the truth, there remaineth no more sacrifice for
        sins,

010:027 But a certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery
        indignation, which shall devour the adversaries.

010:028 He that despised Moses' law died without mercy under two or
        three witnesses:

010:029 Of how much sorer punishment, suppose ye, shall he be thought
        worthy, who hath trodden under foot the Son of God, and hath
        counted the blood of the covenant, wherewith he was
        sanctified, an unholy thing, and hath done despite unto the
        Spirit of grace?

010:030 For we know him that hath said, Vengeance belongeth unto me, I
        will recompense, saith the Lord. And again, The Lord shall
        judge his people.

010:031 It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living
        God.

010:032 But call to remembrance the former days, in which, after ye
        were illuminated, ye endured a great fight of afflictions;

010:033 Partly, whilst ye were made a gazingstock both by reproaches
        and afflictions; and partly, whilst ye became companions of
        them that were so used.

010:034 For ye had compassion of me in my bonds, and took joyfully the
        spoiling of your goods, knowing in yourselves that ye have in
        heaven a better and an enduring substance.

010:035 Cast not away therefore your confidence, which hath great
        recompence of reward.

010:036 For ye have need of patience, that, after ye have done the
        will of God, ye might receive the promise.

010:037 For yet a little while, and he that shall come will come, and
        will not tarry.

010:038 Now the just shall live by faith: but if any man draw back, my
        soul shall have no pleasure in him.

010:039 But we are not of them who draw back unto perdition; but of
        them that believe to the saving of the soul.

011:001 Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence
        of things not seen.

011:002 For by it the elders obtained a good report.

011:003 Through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the
        word of God, so that things which are seen were not made of
        things which do appear.

011:004 By faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than
        Cain, by which he obtained witness that he was righteous, God
        testifying of his gifts: and by it he being dead yet speaketh.

011:005 By faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death;
        and was not found, because God had translated him: for before
        his translation he had this testimony, that he pleased God.

011:006 But without faith it is impossible to please him: for he that
        cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a
        rewarder of them that diligently seek him.

011:007 By faith Noah, being warned of God of things not seen as yet,
        moved with fear, prepared an ark to the saving of his house;
        by the which he condemned the world, and became heir of the
        righteousness which is by faith.

011:008 By faith Abraham, when he was called to go out into a place
        which he should after receive for an inheritance, obeyed; and
        he went out, not knowing whither he went.

011:009 By faith he sojourned in the land of promise, as in a strange
        country, dwelling in tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob, the
        heirs with him of the same promise:

011:010 For he looked for a city which hath foundations, whose builder
        and maker is God.

011:011 Through faith also Sara herself received strength to conceive
        seed, and was delivered of a child when she was past age,
        because she judged him faithful who had promised.

011:012 Therefore sprang there even of one, and him as good as dead,
        so many as the stars of the sky in multitude, and as the sand
        which is by the sea shore innumerable.

011:013 These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but
        having seen them afar off, and were persuaded of them, and
        embraced them, and confessed that they were strangers and
        pilgrims on the earth.

011:014 For they that say such things declare plainly that they seek a
        country.

011:015 And truly, if they had been mindful of that country from
        whence they came out, they might have had opportunity to have
        returned.

011:016 But now they desire a better country, that is, an heavenly:
        wherefore God is not ashamed to be called their God: for he
        hath prepared for them a city.

011:017 By faith Abraham, when he was tried, offered up Isaac: and he
        that had received the promises offered up his only begotten
        son,

011:018 Of whom it was said, That in Isaac shall thy seed be called:

011:019 Accounting that God was able to raise him up, even from the
        dead; from whence also he received him in a figure.

011:020 By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau concerning things to
        come.

011:021 By faith Jacob, when he was a dying, blessed both the sons of
        Joseph; and worshipped, leaning upon the top of his staff.

011:022 By faith Joseph, when he died, made mention of the departing
        of the children of Israel; and gave commandment concerning his
        bones.

011:023 By faith Moses, when he was born, was hid three months of his
        parents, because they saw he was a proper child; and they were
        not afraid of the king's commandment.

011:024 By faith Moses, when he was come to years, refused to be
        called the son of Pharaoh's daughter;

011:025 Choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God,
        than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season;

011:026 Esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the
        treasures in Egypt: for he had respect unto the recompence of
        the reward.

011:027 By faith he forsook Egypt, not fearing the wrath of the king:
        for he endured, as seeing him who is invisible.

011:028 Through faith he kept the passover, and the sprinkling of
        blood, lest he that destroyed the firstborn should touch them.

011:029 By faith they passed through the Red sea as by dry land: which
        the Egyptians assaying to do were drowned.

011:030 By faith the walls of Jericho fell down, after they were
        compassed about seven days.

011:031 By faith the harlot Rahab perished not with them that believed
        not, when she had received the spies with peace.

011:032 And what shall I more say? for the time would fail me to tell
        of Gedeon, and of Barak, and of Samson, and of Jephthae; of
        David also, and Samuel, and of the prophets:

011:033 Who through faith subdued kingdoms, wrought righteousness,
        obtained promises, stopped the mouths of lions.

011:034 Quenched the violence of fire, escaped the edge of the sword,
        out of weakness were made strong, waxed valiant in fight,
        turned to flight the armies of the aliens.

011:035 Women received their dead raised to life again: and others
        were tortured, not accepting deliverance; that they might
        obtain a better resurrection:

011:036 And others had trial of cruel mockings and scourgings, yea,
        moreover of bonds and imprisonment:

011:037 They were stoned, they were sawn asunder, were tempted, were
        slain with the sword: they wandered about in sheepskins and
        goatskins; being destitute, afflicted, tormented;

011:038 (Of whom the world was not worthy:) they wandered in deserts,
        and in mountains, and in dens and caves of the earth.

011:039 And these all, having obtained a good report through faith,
        received not the promise:

011:040 God having provided some better thing for us, that they
        without us should not be made perfect.

012:001 Wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with so great a
        cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight, and the sin
        which doth so easily beset us, and let us run with patience
        the race that is set before us,

012:002 Looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith; who
        for the joy that was set before him endured the cross,
        despising the shame, and is set down at the right hand of the
        throne of God.

012:003 For consider him that endured such contradiction of sinners
        against himself, lest ye be wearied and faint in your minds.

012:004 Ye have not yet resisted unto blood, striving against sin.

012:005 And ye have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you
        as unto children, My son, despise not thou the chastening of
        the Lord, nor faint when thou art rebuked of him:

012:006 For whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth, and scourgeth every
        son whom he receiveth.

012:007 If ye endure chastening, God dealeth with you as with sons;
        for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not?

012:008 But if ye be without chastisement, whereof all are partakers,
        then are ye bastards, and not sons.

012:009 Furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected
        us, and we gave them reverence: shall we not much rather be in
        subjection unto the Father of spirits, and live?

012:010 For they verily for a few days chastened us after their own
        pleasure; but he for our profit, that we might be partakers of
        his holiness.

012:011 Now no chastening for the present seemeth to be joyous, but
        grievous: nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the peaceable
        fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby.

012:012 Wherefore lift up the hands which hang down, and the feeble
        knees;

012:013 And make straight paths for your feet, lest that which is lame
        be turned out of the way; but let it rather be healed.

012:014 Follow peace with all men, and holiness, without which no man
        shall see the Lord:

012:015 Looking diligently lest any man fail of the grace of God; lest
        any root of bitterness springing up trouble you, and thereby
        many be defiled;

012:016 Lest there be any fornicator, or profane person, as Esau, who
        for one morsel of meat sold his birthright.

012:017 For ye know how that afterward, when he would have inherited
        the blessing, he was rejected: for he found no place of
        repentance, though he sought it carefully with tears.

012:018 For ye are not come unto the mount that might be touched, and
        that burned with fire, nor unto blackness, and darkness, and
        tempest,

012:019 And the sound of a trumpet, and the voice of words; which
        voice they that heard intreated that the word should not be
        spoken to them any more:

012:020 (For they could not endure that which was commanded, And if so
        much as a beast touch the mountain, it shall be stoned, or
        thrust through with a dart:

012:021 And so terrible was the sight, that Moses said, I exceedingly
        fear and quake:)

012:022 But ye are come unto mount Sion, and unto the city of the
        living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an innumerable
        company of angels,

012:023 To the general assembly and church of the firstborn, which are
        written in heaven, and to God the Judge of all, and to the
        spirits of just men made perfect,

012:024 And to Jesus the mediator of the new covenant, and to the
        blood of sprinkling, that speaketh better things that that of
        Abel.

012:025 See that ye refuse not him that speaketh. For if they escaped
        not who refused him that spake on earth, much more shall not
        we escape, if we turn away from him that speaketh from heaven:

012:026 Whose voice then shook the earth: but now he hath promised,
        saying, Yet once more I shake not the earth only, but also
        heaven.

012:027 And this word, Yet once more, signifieth the removing of those
        things that are shaken, as of things that are made, that those
        things which cannot be shaken may remain.

012:028 Wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved, let us
        have grace, whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence
        and godly fear:

012:029 For our God is a consuming fire.

013:001 Let brotherly love continue.

013:002 Be not forgetful to entertain strangers: for thereby some have
        entertained angels unawares.

013:003 Remember them that are in bonds, as bound with them; and them
        which suffer adversity, as being yourselves also in the body.

013:004 Marriage is honourable in all, and the bed undefiled: but
        whoremongers and adulterers God will judge.

013:005 Let your conversation be without covetousness; and be content
        with such things as ye have: for he hath said, I will never
        leave thee, nor forsake thee.

013:006 So that we may boldly say, The Lord is my helper, and I will
        not fear what man shall do unto me.

013:007 Remember them which have the rule over you, who have spoken
        unto you the word of God: whose faith follow, considering the
        end of their conversation.

013:008 Jesus Christ the same yesterday, and to day, and for ever.

013:009 Be not carried about with divers and strange doctrines. For it
        is a good thing that the heart be established with grace; not
        with meats, which have not profited them that have been
        occupied therein.

013:010 We have an altar, whereof they have no right to eat which
        serve the tabernacle.

013:011 For the bodies of those beasts, whose blood is brought into
        the sanctuary by the high priest for sin, are burned without
        the camp.

013:012 Wherefore Jesus also, that he might sanctify the people with
        his own blood, suffered without the gate.

013:013 Let us go forth therefore unto him without the camp, bearing
        his reproach.

013:014 For here have we no continuing city, but we seek one to come.

013:015 By him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God
        continually, that is, the fruit of our lips giving thanks to
        his name.

013:016 But to do good and to communicate forget not: for with such
        sacrifices God is well pleased.

013:017 Obey them that have the rule over you, and submit yourselves:
        for they watch for your souls, as they that must give account,
        that they may do it with joy, and not with grief: for that is
        unprofitable for you.

013:018 Pray for us: for we trust we have a good conscience, in all
        things willing to live honestly.

013:019 But I beseech you the rather to do this, that I may be
        restored to you the sooner.

013:020 Now the God of peace, that brought again from the dead our
        Lord Jesus, that great shepherd of the sheep, through the
        blood of the everlasting covenant,

013:021 Make you perfect in every good work to do his will, working in
        you that which is wellpleasing in his sight, through Jesus
        Christ; to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.

013:022 And I beseech you, brethren, suffer the word of exhortation:
        for I have written a letter unto you in few words.

013:023 Know ye that our brother Timothy is set at liberty; with whom,
        if he come shortly, I will see you.

013:024 Salute all them that have the rule over you, and all the
        saints. They of Italy salute you.

013:025 Grace be with you all. Amen.

Book 59	James

001:001 James, a servant of God and of the Lord Jesus Christ, to the
        twelve tribes which are scattered abroad, greeting.

001:002 My brethren, count it all joy when ye fall into divers
        temptations;

001:003 Knowing this, that the trying of your faith worketh patience.

001:004 But let patience have her perfect work, that ye may be perfect
        and entire, wanting nothing.

001:005 If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to
        all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it shall be given
        him.

001:006 But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that
        wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and
        tossed.

001:007 For let not that man think that he shall receive any thing of
        the Lord.

001:008 A double minded man is unstable in all his ways.

001:009 Let the brother of low degree rejoice in that he is exalted:

001:010 But the rich, in that he is made low: because as the flower of
        the grass he shall pass away.

001:011 For the sun is no sooner risen with a burning heat, but it
        withereth the grass, and the flower thereof falleth, and the
        grace of the fashion of it perisheth: so also shall the rich
        man fade away in his ways.

001:012 Blessed is the man that endureth temptation: for when he is
        tried, he shall receive the crown of life, which the Lord hath
        promised to them that love him.

001:013 Let no man say when he is tempted, I am tempted of God: for
        God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man:

001:014 But every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own
        lust, and enticed.

001:015 Then when lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth sin: and sin,
        when it is finished, bringeth forth death.

001:016 Do not err, my beloved brethren.

001:017 Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and
        cometh down from the Father of lights, with whom is no
        variableness, neither shadow of turning.

001:018 Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth, that we
        should be a kind of firstfruits of his creatures.

001:019 Wherefore, my beloved brethren, let every man be swift to
        hear, slow to speak, slow to wrath:

001:020 For the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God.

001:021 Wherefore lay apart all filthiness and superfluity of
        naughtiness, and receive with meekness the engrafted word,
        which is able to save your souls.

001:022 But be ye doers of the word, and not hearers only, deceiving
        your own selves.

001:023 For if any be a hearer of the word, and not a doer, he is like
        unto a man beholding his natural face in a glass:

001:024 For he beholdeth himself, and goeth his way, and straightway
        forgetteth what manner of man he was.

001:025 But whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and
        continueth therein, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a
        doer of the work, this man shall be blessed in his deed.

001:026 If any man among you seem to be religious, and bridleth not
        his tongue, but deceiveth his own heart, this man's religion
        is vain.

001:027 Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father is this,
        To visit the fatherless and widows in their affliction, and to
        keep himself unspotted from the world.

002:001 My brethren, have not the faith of our Lord Jesus Christ, the
        Lord of glory, with respect of persons.

002:002 For if there come unto your assembly a man with a gold ring,
        in goodly apparel, and there come in also a poor man in vile
        raiment;

002:003 And ye have respect to him that weareth the gay clothing, and
        say unto him, Sit thou here in a good place; and say to the
        poor, Stand thou there, or sit here under my footstool:

002:004 Are ye not then partial in yourselves, and are become judges
        of evil thoughts?

002:005 Hearken, my beloved brethren, Hath not God chosen the poor of
        this world rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which he
        hath promised to them that love him?

002:006 But ye have despised the poor. Do not rich men oppress you,
        and draw you before the judgment seats?

002:007 Do not they blaspheme that worthy name by the which ye are
        called?

002:008 If ye fulfil the royal law according to the scripture, Thou
        shalt love thy neighbour as thyself, ye do well:

002:009 But if ye have respect to persons, ye commit sin, and are
        convinced of the law as transgressors.

002:010 For whosoever shall keep the whole law, and yet offend in one
        point, he is guilty of all.

002:011 For he that said, Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not
        kill. Now if thou commit no adultery, yet if thou kill, thou
        art become a transgressor of the law.

002:012 So speak ye, and so do, as they that shall be judged by the
        law of liberty.

002:013 For he shall have judgment without mercy, that hath shewed no
        mercy; and mercy rejoiceth against judgment.

002:014 What doth it profit, my brethren, though a man say he hath
        faith, and have not works? can faith save him?

002:015 If a brother or sister be naked, and destitute of daily food,

002:016 And one of you say unto them, Depart in peace, be ye warmed
        and filled; notwithstanding ye give them not those things
        which are needful to the body; what doth it profit?

002:017 Even so faith, if it hath not works, is dead, being alone.

002:018 Yea, a man may say, Thou hast faith, and I have works: shew me
        thy faith without thy works, and I will shew thee my faith by
        my works.

002:019 Thou believest that there is one God; thou doest well: the
        devils also believe, and tremble.

002:020 But wilt thou know, O vain man, that faith without works is
        dead?

002:021 Was not Abraham our father justified by works, when he had
        offered Isaac his son upon the altar?

002:022 Seest thou how faith wrought with his works, and by works was
        faith made perfect?

002:023 And the scripture was fulfilled which saith, Abraham believed
        God, and it was imputed unto him for righteousness: and he was
        called the Friend of God.

002:024 Ye see then how that by works a man is justified, and not by
        faith only.

002:025 Likewise also was not Rahab the harlot justified by works,
        when she had received the messengers, and had sent them out
        another way?

002:026 For as the body without the spirit is dead, so faith without
        works is dead also.

003:001 My brethren, be not many masters, knowing that we shall
        receive the greater condemnation.

003:002 For in many things we offend all. If any man offend not in
        word, the same is a perfect man, and able also to bridle the
        whole body.

003:003 Behold, we put bits in the horses' mouths, that they may obey
        us; and we turn about their whole body.

003:004 Behold also the ships, which though they be so great, and are
        driven of fierce winds, yet are they turned about with a very
        small helm, whithersoever the governor listeth.

003:005 Even so the tongue is a little member, and boasteth great
        things. Behold, how great a matter a little fire kindleth!

003:006 And the tongue is a fire, a world of iniquity: so is the
        tongue among our members, that it defileth the whole body, and
        setteth on fire the course of nature; and it is set on fire of
        hell.

003:007 For every kind of beasts, and of birds, and of serpents, and
        of things in the sea, is tamed, and hath been tamed of
        mankind:

003:008 But the tongue can no man tame; it is an unruly evil, full of
        deadly poison.

003:009 Therewith bless we God, even the Father; and therewith curse
        we men, which are made after the similitude of God.

003:010 Out of the same mouth proceedeth blessing and cursing. My
        brethren, these things ought not so to be.

003:011 Doth a fountain send forth at the same place sweet water and
        bitter?

003:012 Can the fig tree, my brethren, bear olive berries? either a
        vine, figs? so can no fountain both yield salt water and
        fresh.

003:013 Who is a wise man and endued with knowledge among you? let him
        shew out of a good conversation his works with meekness of
        wisdom.

003:014 But if ye have bitter envying and strife in your hearts, glory
        not, and lie not against the truth.

003:015 This wisdom descendeth not from above, but is earthly,
        sensual, devilish.

003:016 For where envying and strife is, there is confusion and every
        evil work.

003:017 But the wisdom that is from above is first pure, then
        peaceable, gentle, and easy to be intreated, full of mercy and
        good fruits, without partiality, and without hypocrisy.

003:018 And the fruit of righteousness is sown in peace of them that
        make peace.

004:001 From whence come wars and fightings among you? come they not
        hence, even of your lusts that war in your members?

004:002 Ye lust, and have not: ye kill, and desire to have, and cannot
        obtain: ye fight and war, yet ye have not, because ye ask not.

004:003 Ye ask, and receive not, because ye ask amiss, that ye may
        consume it upon your lusts.

004:004 Ye adulterers and adulteresses, know ye not that the
        friendship of the world is enmity with God? whosoever
        therefore will be a friend of the world is the enemy of God.

004:005 Do ye think that the scripture saith in vain, The spirit that
        dwelleth in us lusteth to envy?

004:006 But he giveth more grace. Wherefore he saith, God resisteth
        the proud, but giveth grace unto the humble.

004:007 Submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil, and he
        will flee from you.

004:008 Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you. Cleanse your
        hands, ye sinners; and purify your hearts, ye double minded.

004:009 Be afflicted, and mourn, and weep: let your laughter be turned
        to mourning, and your joy to heaviness.

004:010 Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and he shall lift
        you up.

004:011 Speak not evil one of another, brethren. He that speaketh evil
        of his brother, and judgeth his brother, speaketh evil of the
        law, and judgeth the law: but if thou judge the law, thou art
        not a doer of the law, but a judge.

004:012 There is one lawgiver, who is able to save and to destroy: who
        art thou that judgest another?

004:013 Go to now, ye that say, To day or to morrow we will go into
        such a city, and continue there a year, and buy and sell, and
        get gain:

004:014 Whereas ye know not what shall be on the morrow. For what is
        your life? It is even a vapour, that appeareth for a little
        time, and then vanisheth away.

004:015 For that ye ought to say, If the Lord will, we shall live, and
        do this, or that.

004:016 But now ye rejoice in your boastings: all such rejoicing is
        evil.

004:017 Therefore to him that knoweth to do good, and doeth it not, to
        him it is sin.

005:001 Go to now, ye rich men, weep and howl for your miseries that
        shall come upon you.

005:002 Your riches are corrupted, and your garments are motheaten.

005:003 Your gold and silver is cankered; and the rust of them shall
        be a witness against you, and shall eat your flesh as it were
        fire. Ye have heaped treasure together for the last days.

005:004 Behold, the hire of the labourers who have reaped down your
        fields, which is of you kept back by fraud, crieth: and the
        cries of them which have reaped are entered into the ears of
        the Lord of sabaoth.

005:005 Ye have lived in pleasure on the earth, and been wanton; ye
        have nourished your hearts, as in a day of slaughter.

005:006 Ye have condemned and killed the just; and he doth not resist
        you.

005:007 Be patient therefore, brethren, unto the coming of the Lord.
        Behold, the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the
        earth, and hath long patience for it, until he receive the
        early and latter rain.

005:008 Be ye also patient; stablish your hearts: for the coming of
        the Lord draweth nigh.

005:009 Grudge not one against another, brethren, lest ye be
        condemned: behold, the judge standeth before the door.

005:010 Take, my brethren, the prophets, who have spoken in the name
        of the Lord, for an example of suffering affliction, and of
        patience.

005:011 Behold, we count them happy which endure. Ye have heard of the
        patience of Job, and have seen the end of the Lord; that the
        Lord is very pitiful, and of tender mercy.

005:012 But above all things, my brethren, swear not, neither by
        heaven, neither by the earth, neither by any other oath: but
        let your yea be yea; and your nay, nay; lest ye fall into
        condemnation.

005:013 Is any among you afflicted? let him pray. Is any merry? let
        him sing psalms.

005:014 Is any sick among you? let him call for the elders of the
        church; and let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in
        the name of the Lord:

005:015 And the prayer of faith shall save the sick, and the Lord
        shall raise him up; and if he have committed sins, they shall
        be forgiven him.

005:016 Confess your faults one to another, and pray one for another,
        that ye may be healed. The effectual fervent prayer of a
        righteous man availeth much.

005:017 Elias was a man subject to like passions as we are, and he
        prayed earnestly that it might not rain: and it rained not on
        the earth by the space of three years and six months.

005:018 And he prayed again, and the heaven gave rain, and the earth
        brought forth her fruit.

005:019 Brethren, if any of you do err from the truth, and one convert
        him;

005:020 Let him know, that he which converteth the sinner from the
        error of his way shall save a soul from death, and shall hide
        a multitude of sins.

Book 60	1 Peter

001:001 Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ, to the strangers scattered
        throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia,

001:002 Elect according to the foreknowledge of God the Father,
        through sanctification of the Spirit, unto obedience and
        sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ: Grace unto you, and
        peace, be multiplied.

001:003 Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which
        according to his abundant mercy hath begotten us again unto a
        lively hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,

001:004 To an inheritance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that
        fadeth not away, reserved in heaven for you,

001:005 Who are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation
        ready to be revealed in the last time.

001:006 Wherein ye greatly rejoice, though now for a season, if need
        be, ye are in heaviness through manifold temptations:

001:007 That the trial of your faith, being much more precious than of
        gold that perisheth, though it be tried with fire, might be
        found unto praise and honour and glory at the appearing of
        Jesus Christ:

001:008 Whom having not seen, ye love; in whom, though now ye see him
        not, yet believing, ye rejoice with joy unspeakable and full
        of glory:

001:009 Receiving the end of your faith, even the salvation of your
        souls.

001:010 Of which salvation the prophets have enquired and searched
        diligently, who prophesied of the grace that should come unto
        you:

001:011 Searching what, or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ
        which was in them did signify, when it testified beforehand
        the sufferings of Christ, and the glory that should follow.

001:012 Unto whom it was revealed, that not unto themselves, but unto
        us they did minister the things, which are now reported unto
        you by them that have preached the gospel unto you with the
        Holy Ghost sent down from heaven; which things the angels
        desire to look into.

001:013 Wherefore gird up the loins of your mind, be sober, and hope
        to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the
        revelation of Jesus Christ;

001:014 As obedient children, not fashioning yourselves according to
        the former lusts in your ignorance:

001:015 But as he which hath called you is holy, so be ye holy in all
        manner of conversation;

001:016 Because it is written, Be ye holy; for I am holy.

001:017 And if ye call on the Father, who without respect of persons
        judgeth according to every man's work, pass the time of your
        sojourning here in fear:

001:018 Forasmuch as ye know that ye were not redeemed with
        corruptible things, as silver and gold, from your vain
        conversation received by tradition from your fathers;

001:019 But with the precious blood of Christ, as of a lamb without
        blemish and without spot:

001:020 Who verily was foreordained before the foundation of the
        world, but was manifest in these last times for you,

001:021 Who by him do believe in God, that raised him up from the
        dead, and gave him glory; that your faith and hope might be in
        God.

001:022 Seeing ye have purified your souls in obeying the truth
        through the Spirit unto unfeigned love of the brethren, see
        that ye love one another with a pure heart fervently:

001:023 Being born again, not of corruptible seed, but of
        incorruptible, by the word of God, which liveth and abideth
        for ever.

001:024 For all flesh is as grass, and all the glory of man as the
        flower of grass. The grass withereth, and the flower thereof
        falleth away:

001:025 But the word of the Lord endureth for ever. And this is the
        word which by the gospel is preached unto you.

002:001 Wherefore laying aside all malice, and all guile, and
        hypocrisies, and envies, all evil speakings,

002:002 As newborn babes, desire the sincere milk of the word, that ye
        may grow thereby:

002:003 If so be ye have tasted that the Lord is gracious.

002:004 To whom coming, as unto a living stone, disallowed indeed of
        men, but chosen of God, and precious,

002:005 Ye also, as lively stones, are built up a spiritual house, an
        holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable
        to God by Jesus Christ.

002:006 Wherefore also it is contained in the scripture, Behold, I lay
        in Sion a chief corner stone, elect, precious: and he that
        believeth on him shall not be confounded.

002:007 Unto you therefore which believe he is precious: but unto them
        which be disobedient, the stone which the builders disallowed,
        the same is made the head of the corner,

002:008 And a stone of stumbling, and a rock of offence, even to them
        which stumble at the word, being disobedient: whereunto also
        they were appointed.

002:009 But ye are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, an holy
        nation, a peculiar people; that ye should shew forth the
        praises of him who hath called you out of darkness into his
        marvellous light;

002:010 Which in time past were not a people, but are now the people
        of God: which had not obtained mercy, but now have obtained
        mercy.

002:011 Dearly beloved, I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims,
        abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul;

002:012 Having your conversation honest among the Gentiles: that,
        whereas they speak against you as evildoers, they may by your
        good works, which they shall behold, glorify God in the day of
        visitation.

002:013 Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord's
        sake: whether it be to the king, as supreme;

002:014 Or unto governors, as unto them that are sent by him for the
        punishment of evildoers, and for the praise of them that do
        well.

002:015 For so is the will of God, that with well doing ye may put to
        silence the ignorance of foolish men:

002:016 As free, and not using your liberty for a cloke of
        maliciousness, but as the servants of God.

002:017 Honour all men. Love the brotherhood. Fear God. Honour the
        king.

002:018 Servants, be subject to your masters with all fear; not only
        to the good and gentle, but also to the froward.

002:019 For this is thankworthy, if a man for conscience toward God
        endure grief, suffering wrongfully.

002:020 For what glory is it, if, when ye be buffeted for your faults,
        ye shall take it patiently? but if, when ye do well, and
        suffer for it, ye take it patiently, this is acceptable with
        God.

002:021 For even hereunto were ye called: because Christ also suffered
        for us, leaving us an example, that ye should follow his
        steps:

002:022 Who did no sin, neither was guile found in his mouth:

002:023 Who, when he was reviled, reviled not again; when he suffered,
        he threatened not; but committed himself to him that judgeth
        righteously:

002:024 Who his own self bare our sins in his own body on the tree,
        that we, being dead to sins, should live unto righteousness:
        by whose stripes ye were healed.

002:025 For ye were as sheep going astray; but are now returned unto
        the Shepherd and Bishop of your souls.

003:001 Likewise, ye wives, be in subjection to your own husbands;
        that, if any obey not the word, they also may without the word
        be won by the conversation of the wives;

003:002 While they behold your chaste conversation coupled with fear.

003:003 Whose adorning let it not be that outward adorning of plaiting
        the hair, and of wearing of gold, or of putting on of apparel;

003:004 But let it be the hidden man of the heart, in that which is
        not corruptible, even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit,
        which is in the sight of God of great price.

003:005 For after this manner in the old time the holy women also, who
        trusted in God, adorned themselves, being in subjection unto
        their own husbands:

003:006 Even as Sara obeyed Abraham, calling him lord: whose daughters
        ye are, as long as ye do well, and are not afraid with any
        amazement.

003:007 Likewise, ye husbands, dwell with them according to knowledge,
        giving honour unto the wife, as unto the weaker vessel, and as
        being heirs together of the grace of life; that your prayers
        be not hindered.

003:008 Finally, be ye all of one mind, having compassion one of
        another, love as brethren, be pitiful, be courteous:

003:009 Not rendering evil for evil, or railing for railing: but
        contrariwise blessing; knowing that ye are thereunto called,
        that ye should inherit a blessing.

003:010 For he that will love life, and see good days, let him refrain
        his tongue from evil, and his lips that they speak no guile:

003:011 Let him eschew evil, and do good; let him seek peace, and
        ensue it.

003:012 For the eyes of the Lord are over the righteous, and his ears
        are open unto their prayers: but the face of the Lord is
        against them that do evil.

003:013 And who is he that will harm you, if ye be followers of that
        which is good?

003:014 But and if ye suffer for righteousness' sake, happy are ye:
        and be not afraid of their terror, neither be troubled;

003:015 But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts: and be ready always
        to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the
        hope that is in you with meekness and fear:

003:016 Having a good conscience; that, whereas they speak evil of
        you, as of evildoers, they may be ashamed that falsely accuse
        your good conversation in Christ.

003:017 For it is better, if the will of God be so, that ye suffer for
        well doing, than for evil doing.

003:018 For Christ also hath once suffered for sins, the just for the
        unjust, that he might bring us to God, being put to death in
        the flesh, but quickened by the Spirit:

003:019 By which also he went and preached unto the spirits in prison;

003:020 Which sometime were disobedient, when once the longsuffering
        of God waited in the days of Noah, while the ark was a
        preparing, wherein few, that is, eight souls were saved by
        water.

003:021 The like figure whereunto even baptism doth also now save us
        (not the putting away of the filth of the flesh, but the
        answer of a good conscience toward God,) by the resurrection
        of Jesus Christ:

003:022 Who is gone into heaven, and is on the right hand of God;
        angels and authorities and powers being made subject unto him.

004:001 Forasmuch then as Christ hath suffered for us in the flesh,
        arm yourselves likewise with the same mind: for he that hath
        suffered in the flesh hath ceased from sin;

004:002 That he no longer should live the rest of his time in the
        flesh to the lusts of men, but to the will of God.

004:003 For the time past of our life may suffice us to have wrought
        the will of the Gentiles, when we walked in lasciviousness,
        lusts, excess of wine, revellings, banquetings, and abominable
        idolatries:

004:004 Wherein they think it strange that ye run not with them to the
        same excess of riot, speaking evil of you:

004:005 Who shall give account to him that is ready to judge the quick
        and the dead.

004:006 For for this cause was the gospel preached also to them that
        are dead, that they might be judged according to men in the
        flesh, but live according to God in the spirit.

004:007 But the end of all things is at hand: be ye therefore sober,
        and watch unto prayer.

004:008 And above all things have fervent charity among yourselves:
        for charity shall cover the multitude of sins.

004:009 Use hospitality one to another without grudging.

004:010 As every man hath received the gift, even so minister the same
        one to another, as good stewards of the manifold grace of God.

004:011 If any man speak, let him speak as the oracles of God; if any
        man minister, let him do it as of the ability which God
        giveth: that God in all things may be glorified through Jesus
        Christ, to whom be praise and dominion for ever and ever.
        Amen.

004:012 Beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial which
        is to try you, as though some strange thing happened unto you:

004:013 But rejoice, inasmuch as ye are partakers of Christ's
        sufferings; that, when his glory shall be revealed, ye may be
        glad also with exceeding joy.

004:014 If ye be reproached for the name of Christ, happy are ye; for
        the spirit of glory and of God resteth upon you: on their part
        he is evil spoken of, but on your part he is glorified.

004:015 But let none of you suffer as a murderer, or as a thief, or as
        an evildoer, or as a busybody in other men's matters.

004:016 Yet if any man suffer as a Christian, let him not be ashamed;
        but let him glorify God on this behalf.

004:017 For the time is come that judgment must begin at the house of
        God: and if it first begin at us, what shall the end be of
        them that obey not the gospel of God?

004:018 And if the righteous scarcely be saved, where shall the
        ungodly and the sinner appear?

004:019 Wherefore let them that suffer according to the will of God
        commit the keeping of their souls to him in well doing, as
        unto a faithful Creator.

005:001 The elders which are among you I exhort, who am also an elder,
        and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, and also a partaker
        of the glory that shall be revealed:

005:002 Feed the flock of God which is among you, taking the oversight
        thereof, not by constraint, but willingly; not for filthy
        lucre, but of a ready mind;

005:003 Neither as being lords over God's heritage, but being
        ensamples to the flock.

005:004 And when the chief Shepherd shall appear, ye shall receive a
        crown of glory that fadeth not away.

005:005 Likewise, ye younger, submit yourselves unto the elder. Yea,
        all of you be subject one to another, and be clothed with
        humility: for God resisteth the proud, and giveth grace to the
        humble.

005:006 Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, that
        he may exalt you in due time:

005:007 Casting all your care upon him; for he careth for you.

005:008 Be sober, be vigilant; because your adversary the devil, as a
        roaring lion, walketh about, seeking whom he may devour:

005:009 Whom resist stedfast in the faith, knowing that the same
        afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the
        world.

005:010 But the God of all grace, who hath called us unto his eternal
        glory by Christ Jesus, after that ye have suffered a while,
        make you perfect, stablish, strengthen, settle you.

005:011 To him be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.

005:012 By Silvanus, a faithful brother unto you, as I suppose, I have
        written briefly, exhorting, and testifying that this is the
        true grace of God wherein ye stand.

005:013 The church that is at Babylon, elected together with you,
        saluteth you; and so doth Marcus my son.

005:014 Greet ye one another with a kiss of charity. Peace be with you
        all that are in Christ Jesus. Amen.

Book 61	2 Peter

001:001 Simon Peter, a servant and an apostle of Jesus Christ, to them
        that have obtained like precious faith with us through the
        righteousness of God and our Saviour Jesus Christ:

001:002 Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge
        of God, and of Jesus our Lord,

001:003 According as his divine power hath given unto us all things
        that pertain unto life and godliness, through the knowledge of
        him that hath called us to glory and virtue:

001:004 Whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious
        promises: that by these ye might be partakers of the divine
        nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world
        through lust.

001:005 And beside this, giving all diligence, add to your faith
        virtue; and to virtue knowledge;

001:006 And to knowledge temperance; and to temperance patience; and
        to patience godliness;

001:007 And to godliness brotherly kindness; and to brotherly kindness
        charity.

001:008 For if these things be in you, and abound, they make you that
        ye shall neither be barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of
        our Lord Jesus Christ.

001:009 But he that lacketh these things is blind, and cannot see afar
        off, and hath forgotten that he was purged from his old sins.

001:010 Wherefore the rather, brethren, give diligence to make your
        calling and election sure: for if ye do these things, ye shall
        never fall:

001:011 For so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly
        into the everlasting kingdom of our Lord and Saviour Jesus
        Christ.

001:012 Wherefore I will not be negligent to put you always in
        remembrance of these things, though ye know them, and be
        established in the present truth.

001:013 Yea, I think it meet, as long as I am in this tabernacle, to
        stir you up by putting you in remembrance;

001:014 Knowing that shortly I must put off this my tabernacle, even
        as our Lord Jesus Christ hath shewed me.

001:015 Moreover I will endeavour that ye may be able after my decease
        to have these things always in remembrance.

001:016 For we have not followed cunningly devised fables, when we
        made known unto you the power and coming of our Lord Jesus
        Christ, but were eyewitnesses of his majesty.

001:017 For he received from God the Father honour and glory, when
        there came such a voice to him from the excellent glory, This
        is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased.

001:018 And this voice which came from heaven we heard, when we were
        with him in the holy mount.

001:019 We have also a more sure word of prophecy; whereunto ye do
        well that ye take heed, as unto a light that shineth in a dark
        place, until the day dawn, and the day star arise in your
        hearts:

001:020 Knowing this first, that no prophecy of the scripture is of
        any private interpretation.

001:021 For the prophecy came not in old time by the will of man: but
        holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.

002:001 But there were false prophets also among the people, even as
        there shall be false teachers among you, who privily shall
        bring in damnable heresies, even denying the Lord that bought
        them, and bring upon themselves swift destruction.

002:002 And many shall follow their pernicious ways; by reason of whom
        the way of truth shall be evil spoken of.

002:003 And through covetousness shall they with feigned words make
        merchandise of you: whose judgment now of a long time
        lingereth not, and their damnation slumbereth not.

002:004 For if God spared not the angels that sinned, but cast them
        down to hell, and delivered them into chains of darkness, to
        be reserved unto judgment;

002:005 And spared not the old world, but saved Noah the eighth
        person, a preacher of righteousness, bringing in the flood
        upon the world of the ungodly;

002:006 And turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrha into ashes
        condemned them with an overthrow, making them an ensample unto
        those that after should live ungodly;

002:007 And delivered just Lot, vexed with the filthy conversation of
        the wicked:

002:008 (For that righteous man dwelling among them, in seeing and
        hearing, vexed his righteous soul from day to day with their
        unlawful deeds;)

002:009 The Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptations,
        and to reserve the unjust unto the day of judgment to be
        punished:

002:010 But chiefly them that walk after the flesh in the lust of
        uncleanness, and despise government. Presumptuous are they,
        selfwilled, they are not afraid to speak evil of dignities.

002:011 Whereas angels, which are greater in power and might, bring
        not railing accusation against them before the Lord.

002:012 But these, as natural brute beasts, made to be taken and
        destroyed, speak evil of the things that they understand not;
        and shall utterly perish in their own corruption;

002:013 And shall receive the reward of unrighteousness, as they that
        count it pleasure to riot in the day time. Spots they are and
        blemishes, sporting themselves with their own deceivings while
        they feast with you;

002:014 Having eyes full of adultery, and that cannot cease from sin;
        beguiling unstable souls: an heart they have exercised with
        covetous practices; cursed children:

002:015 Which have forsaken the right way, and are gone astray,
        following the way of Balaam the son of Bosor, who loved the
        wages of unrighteousness;

002:016 But was rebuked for his iniquity: the dumb ass speaking with
        man's voice forbad the madness of the prophet.

002:017 These are wells without water, clouds that are carried with a
        tempest; to whom the mist of darkness is reserved for ever.

002:018 For when they speak great swelling words of vanity, they
        allure through the lusts of the flesh, through much
        wantonness, those that were clean escaped from them who live
        in error.

002:019 While they promise them liberty, they themselves are the
        servants of corruption: for of whom a man is overcome, of the
        same is he brought in bondage.

002:020 For if after they have escaped the pollutions of the world
        through the knowledge of the Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ,
        they are again entangled therein, and overcome, the latter end
        is worse with them than the beginning.

002:021 For it had been better for them not to have known the way of
        righteousness, than, after they have known it, to turn from
        the holy commandment delivered unto them.

002:022 But it is happened unto them according to the true proverb,
        The dog is turned to his own vomit again; and the sow that was
        washed to her wallowing in the mire.

003:001 This second epistle, beloved, I now write unto you; in both
        which I stir up your pure minds by way of remembrance:

003:002 That ye may be mindful of the words which were spoken before
        by the holy prophets, and of the commandment of us the
        apostles of the Lord and Saviour:

003:003 Knowing this first, that there shall come in the last days
        scoffers, walking after their own lusts,

003:004 And saying, Where is the promise of his coming? for since the
        fathers fell asleep, all things continue as they were from the
        beginning of the creation.

003:005 For this they willingly are ignorant of, that by the word of
        God the heavens were of old, and the earth standing out of the
        water and in the water:

003:006 Whereby the world that then was, being overflowed with water,
        perished:

003:007 But the heavens and the earth, which are now, by the same word
        are kept in store, reserved unto fire against the day of
        judgment and perdition of ungodly men.

003:008 But, beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing, that one day
        is with the Lord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as
        one day.

003:009 The Lord is not slack concerning his promise, as some men
        count slackness; but is longsuffering to us-ward, not willing
        that any should perish, but that all should come to
        repentance.

003:010 But the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night; in
        the which the heavens shall pass away with a great noise, and
        the elements shall melt with fervent heat, the earth also and
        the works that are therein shall be burned up.

003:011 Seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved, what
        manner of persons ought ye to be in all holy conversation and
        godliness,

003:012 Looking for and hasting unto the coming of the day of God,
        wherein the heavens being on fire shall be dissolved, and the
        elements shall melt with fervent heat?

003:013 Nevertheless we, according to his promise, look for new
        heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteousness.

003:014 Wherefore, beloved, seeing that ye look for such things, be
        diligent that ye may be found of him in peace, without spot,
        and blameless.

003:015 And account that the longsuffering of our Lord is salvation;
        even as our beloved brother Paul also according to the wisdom
        given unto him hath written unto you;

003:016 As also in all his epistles, speaking in them of these things;
        in which are some things hard to be understood, which they
        that are unlearned and unstable wrest, as they do also the
        other scriptures, unto their own destruction.

003:017 Ye therefore, beloved, seeing ye know these things before,
        beware lest ye also, being led away with the error of the
        wicked, fall from your own stedfastness.

003:018 But grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and
        Saviour Jesus Christ. To him be glory both now and for ever.
        Amen.

Book 62	1 John

001:001 That which was from the beginning, which we have heard, which
        we have seen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our
        hands have handled, of the Word of life;

001:002 (For the life was manifested, and we have seen it, and bear
        witness, and shew unto you that eternal life, which was with
        the Father, and was manifested unto us;)

001:003 That which we have seen and heard declare we unto you, that ye
        also may have fellowship with us: and truly our fellowship is
        with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ.

001:004 And these things write we unto you, that your joy may be full.

001:005 This then is the message which we have heard of him, and
        declare unto you, that God is light, and in him is no darkness
        at all.

001:006 If we say that we have fellowship with him, and walk in
        darkness, we lie, and do not the truth:

001:007 But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have
        fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his
        Son cleanseth us from all sin.

001:008 If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the
        truth is not in us.

001:009 If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us
        our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness.

001:010 If we say that we have not sinned, we make him a liar, and his
        word is not in us.

002:001 My little children, these things write I unto you, that ye sin
        not. And if any man sin, we have an advocate with the Father,
        Jesus Christ the righteous:

002:002 And he is the propitiation for our sins: and not for our's
        only, but also for the sins of the whole world.

002:003 And hereby we do know that we know him, if we keep his
        commandments.

002:004 He that saith, I know him, and keepeth not his commandments,
        is a liar, and the truth is not in him.

002:005 But whoso keepeth his word, in him verily is the love of God
        perfected: hereby know we that we are in him.

002:006 He that saith he abideth in him ought himself also so to walk,
        even as he walked.

002:007 Brethren, I write no new commandment unto you, but an old
        commandment which ye had from the beginning. The old
        commandment is the word which ye have heard from the
        beginning.

002:008 Again, a new commandment I write unto you, which thing is true
        in him and in you: because the darkness is past, and the true
        light now shineth.

002:009 He that saith he is in the light, and hateth his brother, is
        in darkness even until now.

002:010 He that loveth his brother abideth in the light, and there is
        none occasion of stumbling in him.

002:011 But he that hateth his brother is in darkness, and walketh in
        darkness, and knoweth not whither he goeth, because that
        darkness hath blinded his eyes.

002:012 I write unto you, little children, because your sins are
        forgiven you for his name's sake.

002:013 I write unto you, fathers, because ye have known him that is
        from the beginning. I write unto you, young men, because ye
        have overcome the wicked one. I write unto you, little
        children, because ye have known the Father.

002:014 I have written unto you, fathers, because ye have known him
        that is from the beginning. I have written unto you, young
        men, because ye are strong, and the word of God abideth in
        you, and ye have overcome the wicked one.

002:015 Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world.
        If any man love the world, the love of the Father is not in
        him.

002:016 For all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, and the
        lust of the eyes, and the pride of life, is not of the Father,
        but is of the world.

002:017 And the world passeth away, and the lust thereof: but he that
        doeth the will of God abideth for ever.

002:018 Little children, it is the last time: and as ye have heard
        that antichrist shall come, even now are there many
        antichrists; whereby we know that it is the last time.

002:019 They went out from us, but they were not of us; for if they
        had been of us, they would no doubt have continued with us:
        but they went out, that they might be made manifest that they
        were not all of us.

002:020 But ye have an unction from the Holy One, and ye know all
        things.

002:021 I have not written unto you because ye know not the truth, but
        because ye know it, and that no lie is of the truth.

002:022 Who is a liar but he that denieth that Jesus is the Christ? He
        is antichrist, that denieth the Father and the Son.

002:023 Whosoever denieth the Son, the same hath not the Father: he
        that acknowledgeth the Son hath the Father also.

002:024 Let that therefore abide in you, which ye have heard from the
        beginning. If that which ye have heard from the beginning
        shall remain in you, ye also shall continue in the Son, and in
        the Father.

002:025 And this is the promise that he hath promised us, even eternal
        life.

002:026 These things have I written unto you concerning them that
        seduce you.

002:027 But the anointing which ye have received of him abideth in
        you, and ye need not that any man teach you: but as the same
        anointing teacheth you of all things, and is truth, and is no
        lie, and even as it hath taught you, ye shall abide in him.

002:028 And now, little children, abide in him; that, when he shall
        appear, we may have confidence, and not be ashamed before him
        at his coming.

002:029 If ye know that he is righteous, ye know that every one that
        doeth righteousness is born of him.

003:001 Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us,
        that we should be called the sons of God: therefore the world
        knoweth us not, because it knew him not.

003:002 Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet
        appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall
        appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is.

003:003 And every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself,
        even as he is pure.

003:004 Whosoever committeth sin transgresseth also the law: for sin
        is the transgression of the law.

003:005 And ye know that he was manifested to take away our sins; and
        in him is no sin.

003:006 Whosoever abideth in him sinneth not: whosoever sinneth hath
        not seen him, neither known him.

003:007 Little children, let no man deceive you: he that doeth
        righteousness is righteous, even as he is righteous.

003:008 He that committeth sin is of the devil; for the devil sinneth
        from the beginning. For this purpose the Son of God was
        manifested, that he might destroy the works of the devil.

003:009 Whosoever is born of God doth not commit sin; for his seed
        remaineth in him: and he cannot sin, because he is born of
        God.

003:010 In this the children of God are manifest, and the children of
        the devil: whosoever doeth not righteousness is not of God,
        neither he that loveth not his brother.

003:011 For this is the message that ye heard from the beginning, that
        we should love one another.

003:012 Not as Cain, who was of that wicked one, and slew his brother.
        And wherefore slew he him? Because his own works were evil,
        and his brother's righteous.

003:013 Marvel not, my brethren, if the world hate you.

003:014 We know that we have passed from death unto life, because we
        love the brethren. He that loveth not his brother abideth in
        death.

003:015 Whosoever hateth his brother is a murderer: and ye know that
        no murderer hath eternal life abiding in him.

003:016 Hereby perceive we the love of God, because he laid down his
        life for us: and we ought to lay down our lives for the
        brethren.

003:017 But whoso hath this world's good, and seeth his brother have
        need, and shutteth up his bowels of compassion from him, how
        dwelleth the love of God in him?

003:018 My little children, let us not love in word, neither in
        tongue; but in deed and in truth.

003:019 And hereby we know that we are of the truth, and shall assure
        our hearts before him.

003:020 For if our heart condemn us, God is greater than our heart,
        and knoweth all things.

003:021 Beloved, if our heart condemn us not, then have we confidence
        toward God.

003:022 And whatsoever we ask, we receive of him, because we keep his
        commandments, and do those things that are pleasing in his
        sight.

003:023 And this is his commandment, That we should believe on the
        name of his Son Jesus Christ, and love one another, as he gave
        us commandment.

003:024 And he that keepeth his commandments dwelleth in him, and he
        in him. And hereby we know that he abideth in us, by the
        Spirit which he hath given us.

004:001 Beloved, believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether
        they are of God: because many false prophets are gone out into
        the world.

004:002 Hereby know ye the Spirit of God: Every spirit that confesseth
        that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is of God:

004:003 And every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come
        in the flesh is not of God: and this is that spirit of
        antichrist, whereof ye have heard that it should come; and
        even now already is it in the world.

004:004 Ye are of God, little children, and have overcome them:
        because greater is he that is in you, than he that is in the
        world.

004:005 They are of the world: therefore speak they of the world, and
        the world heareth them.

004:006 We are of God: he that knoweth God heareth us; he that is not
        of God heareth not us. Hereby know we the spirit of truth, and
        the spirit of error.

004:007 Beloved, let us love one another: for love is of God; and
        every one that loveth is born of God, and knoweth God.

004:008 He that loveth not knoweth not God; for God is love.

004:009 In this was manifested the love of God toward us, because that
        God sent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might
        live through him.

004:010 Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us,
        and sent his Son to be the propitiation for our sins.

004:011 Beloved, if God so loved us, we ought also to love one
        another.

004:012 No man hath seen God at any time. If we love one another, God
        dwelleth in us, and his love is perfected in us.

004:013 Hereby know we that we dwell in him, and he in us, because he
        hath given us of his Spirit.

004:014 And we have seen and do testify that the Father sent the Son
        to be the Saviour of the world.

004:015 Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the Son of God, God
        dwelleth in him, and he in God.

004:016 And we have known and believed the love that God hath to us.
        God is love; and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and
        God in him.

004:017 Herein is our love made perfect, that we may have boldness in
        the day of judgment: because as he is, so are we in this
        world.

004:018 There is no fear in love; but perfect love casteth out fear:
        because fear hath torment. He that feareth is not made perfect
        in love.

004:019 We love him, because he first loved us.

004:020 If a man say, I love God, and hateth his brother, he is a
        liar: for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen,
        how can he love God whom he hath not seen?

004:021 And this commandment have we from him, That he who loveth God
        love his brother also.

005:001 Whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of God:
        and every one that loveth him that begat loveth him also that
        is begotten of him.

005:002 By this we know that we love the children of God, when we love
        God, and keep his commandments.

005:003 For this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments:
        and his commandments are not grievous.

005:004 For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world: and this
        is the victory that overcometh the world, even our faith.

005:005 Who is he that overcometh the world, but he that believeth
        that Jesus is the Son of God?

005:006 This is he that came by water and blood, even Jesus Christ;
        not by water only, but by water and blood. And it is the
        Spirit that beareth witness, because the Spirit is truth.

005:007 For there are three that bear record in heaven, the Father,
        the Word, and the Holy Ghost: and these three are one.

005:008 And there are three that bear witness in earth, the Spirit,
        and the water, and the blood: and these three agree in one.

005:009 If we receive the witness of men, the witness of God is
        greater: for this is the witness of God which he hath
        testified of his Son.

005:010 He that believeth on the Son of God hath the witness in
        himself: he that believeth not God hath made him a liar;
        because he believeth not the record that God gave of his Son.

005:011 And this is the record, that God hath given to us eternal
        life, and this life is in his Son.

005:012 He that hath the Son hath life; and he that hath not the Son
        of God hath not life.

005:013 These things have I written unto you that believe on the name
        of the Son of God; that ye may know that ye have eternal life,
        and that ye may believe on the name of the Son of God.

005:014 And this is the confidence that we have in him, that, if we
        ask any thing according to his will, he heareth us:

005:015 And if we know that he hear us, whatsoever we ask, we know
        that we have the petitions that we desired of him.

005:016 If any man see his brother sin a sin which is not unto death,
        he shall ask, and he shall give him life for them that sin not
        unto death. There is a sin unto death: I do not say that he
        shall pray for it.

005:017 All unrighteousness is sin: and there is a sin not unto death.

005:018 We know that whosoever is born of God sinneth not; but he that
        is begotten of God keepeth himself, and that wicked one
        toucheth him not.

005:019 And we know that we are of God, and the whole world lieth in
        wickedness.

005:020 And we know that the Son of God is come, and hath given us an
        understanding, that we may know him that is true, and we are
        in him that is true, even in his Son Jesus Christ. This is the
        true God, and eternal life.

005:021 Little children, keep yourselves from idols. Amen.

Book 63	2 John

001:001 The elder unto the elect lady and her children, whom I love in
        the truth; and not I only, but also all they that have known
        the truth;

001:002 For the truth's sake, which dwelleth in us, and shall be with
        us for ever.

001:003 Grace be with you, mercy, and peace, from God the Father, and
        from the Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of the Father, in truth
        and love.

001:004 I rejoiced greatly that I found of thy children walking in
        truth, as we have received a commandment from the Father.

001:005 And now I beseech thee, lady, not as though I wrote a new
        commandment unto thee, but that which we had from the
        beginning, that we love one another.

001:006 And this is love, that we walk after his commandments. This is
        the commandment, That, as ye have heard from the beginning, ye
        should walk in it.

001:007 For many deceivers are entered into the world, who confess not
        that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh. This is a deceiver and
        an antichrist.

001:008 Look to yourselves, that we lose not those things which we
        have wrought, but that we receive a full reward.

001:009 Whosoever transgresseth, and abideth not in the doctrine of
        Christ, hath not God. He that abideth in the doctrine of
        Christ, he hath both the Father and the Son.

001:010 If there come any unto you, and bring not this doctrine,
        receive him not into your house, neither bid him God speed:

001:011 For he that biddeth him God speed is partaker of his evil
        deeds.

001:012 Having many things to write unto you, I would not write with
        paper and ink: but I trust to come unto you, and speak face to
        face, that our joy may be full.

001:013 The children of thy elect sister greet thee. Amen.

Book 64	3 John

001:001 The elder unto the wellbeloved Gaius, whom I love in the
        truth.

001:002 Beloved, I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and
        be in health, even as thy soul prospereth.

001:003 For I rejoiced greatly, when the brethren came and testified
        of the truth that is in thee, even as thou walkest in the
        truth.

001:004 I have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in
        truth.

001:005 Beloved, thou doest faithfully whatsoever thou doest to the
        brethren, and to strangers;

001:006 Which have borne witness of thy charity before the church:
        whom if thou bring forward on their journey after a godly
        sort, thou shalt do well:

001:007 Because that for his name's sake they went forth, taking
        nothing of the Gentiles.

001:008 We therefore ought to receive such, that we might be
        fellowhelpers to the truth.

001:009 I wrote unto the church: but Diotrephes, who loveth to have
        the preeminence among them, receiveth us not.

001:010 Wherefore, if I come, I will remember his deeds which he
        doeth, prating against us with malicious words: and not
        content therewith, neither doth he himself receive the
        brethren, and forbiddeth them that would, and casteth them out
        of the church.

001:011 Beloved, follow not that which is evil, but that which is
        good. He that doeth good is of God: but he that doeth evil
        hath not seen God.

001:012 Demetrius hath good report of all men, and of the truth
        itself: yea, and we also bear record; and ye know that our
        record is true.

001:013 I had many things to write, but I will not with ink and pen
        write unto thee:

001:014 But I trust I shall shortly see thee, and we shall speak face
        to face. Peace be to thee. Our friends salute thee. Greet the
        friends by name.

Book 65	Jude

001:001 Jude, the servant of Jesus Christ, and brother of James, to
        them that are sanctified by God the Father, and preserved in
        Jesus Christ, and called:

001:002 Mercy unto you, and peace, and love, be multiplied.

001:003 Beloved, when I gave all diligence to write unto you of the
        common salvation, it was needful for me to write unto you, and
        exhort you that ye should earnestly contend for the faith
        which was once delivered unto the saints.

001:004 For there are certain men crept in unawares, who were before
        of old ordained to this condemnation, ungodly men, turning the
        grace of our God into lasciviousness, and denying the only
        Lord God, and our Lord Jesus Christ.

001:005 I will therefore put you in remembrance, though ye once knew
        this, how that the Lord, having saved the people out of the
        land of Egypt, afterward destroyed them that believed not.

001:006 And the angels which kept not their first estate, but left
        their own habitation, he hath reserved in everlasting chains
        under darkness unto the judgment of the great day.

001:007 Even as Sodom and Gomorrha, and the cities about them in like
        manner, giving themselves over to fornication, and going after
        strange flesh, are set forth for an example, suffering the
        vengeance of eternal fire.

001:008 Likewise also these filthy dreamers defile the flesh, despise
        dominion, and speak evil of dignities.

001:009 Yet Michael the archangel, when contending with the devil he
        disputed about the body of Moses, durst not bring against him
        a railing accusation, but said, The Lord rebuke thee.

001:010 But these speak evil of those things which they know not: but
        what they know naturally, as brute beasts, in those things
        they corrupt themselves.

001:011 Woe unto them! for they have gone in the way of Cain, and ran
        greedily after the error of Balaam for reward, and perished in
        the gainsaying of Core.

001:012 These are spots in your feasts of charity, when they feast
        with you, feeding themselves without fear: clouds they are
        without water, carried about of winds; trees whose fruit
        withereth, without fruit, twice dead, plucked up by the roots;

001:013 Raging waves of the sea, foaming out their own shame;
        wandering stars, to whom is reserved the blackness of darkness
        for ever.

001:014 And Enoch also, the seventh from Adam, prophesied of these,
        saying, Behold, the Lord cometh with ten thousands of his
        saints,

001:015 To execute judgment upon all, and to convince all that are
        ungodly among them of all their ungodly deeds which they have
        ungodly committed, and of all their hard speeches which
        ungodly sinners have spoken against him.

001:016 These are murmurers, complainers, walking after their own
        lusts; and their mouth speaketh great swelling words, having
        men's persons in admiration because of advantage.

001:017 But, beloved, remember ye the words which were spoken before
        of the apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ;

001:018 How that they told you there should be mockers in the last
        time, who should walk after their own ungodly lusts.

001:019 These be they who separate themselves, sensual, having not the
        Spirit.

001:020 But ye, beloved, building up yourselves on your most holy
        faith, praying in the Holy Ghost,

001:021 Keep yourselves in the love of God, looking for the mercy of
        our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life.

001:022 And of some have compassion, making a difference:

001:023 And others save with fear, pulling them out of the fire;
        hating even the garment spotted by the flesh.

001:024 Now unto him that is able to keep you from falling, and to
        present you faultless before the presence of his glory with
        exceeding joy,

001:025 To the only wise God our Saviour, be glory and majesty,
        dominion and power, both now and ever. Amen.

Book 66	Revelation

001:001 The Revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave unto him, to
        shew unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass;
        and he sent and signified it by his angel unto his servant
        John:

001:002 Who bare record of the word of God, and of the testimony of
        Jesus Christ, and of all things that he saw.

001:003 Blessed is he that readeth, and they that hear the words of
        this prophecy, and keep those things which are written
        therein: for the time is at hand.

001:004 John to the seven churches which are in Asia: Grace be unto
        you, and peace, from him which is, and which was, and which is
        to come; and from the seven Spirits which are before his
        throne;

001:005 And from Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness, and the
        first begotten of the dead, and the prince of the kings of the
        earth. Unto him that loved us, and washed us from our sins in
        his own blood,

001:006 And hath made us kings and priests unto God and his Father; to
        him be glory and dominion for ever and ever. Amen.

001:007 Behold, he cometh with clouds; and every eye shall see him,
        and they also which pierced him: and all kindreds of the earth
        shall wail because of him. Even so, Amen.

001:008 I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the ending, saith the
        Lord, which is, and which was, and which is to come, the
        Almighty.

001:009 I John, who also am your brother, and companion in
        tribulation, and in the kingdom and patience of Jesus Christ,
        was in the isle that is called Patmos, for the word of God,
        and for the testimony of Jesus Christ.

001:010 I was in the Spirit on the Lord's day, and heard behind me a
        great voice, as of a trumpet,

001:011 Saying, I am Alpha and Omega, the first and the last: and,
        What thou seest, write in a book, and send it unto the seven
        churches which are in Asia; unto Ephesus, and unto Smyrna, and
        unto Pergamos, and unto Thyatira, and unto Sardis, and unto
        Philadelphia, and unto Laodicea.

001:012 And I turned to see the voice that spake with me. And being
        turned, I saw seven golden candlesticks;

001:013 And in the midst of the seven candlesticks one like unto the
        Son of man, clothed with a garment down to the foot, and girt
        about the paps with a golden girdle.

001:014 His head and his hairs were white like wool, as white as snow;
        and his eyes were as a flame of fire;

001:015 And his feet like unto fine brass, as if they burned in a
        furnace; and his voice as the sound of many waters.

001:016 And he had in his right hand seven stars: and out of his mouth
        went a sharp twoedged sword: and his countenance was as the
        sun shineth in his strength.

001:017 And when I saw him, I fell at his feet as dead. And he laid
        his right hand upon me, saying unto me, Fear not; I am the
        first and the last:

001:018 I am he that liveth, and was dead; and, behold, I am alive for
        evermore, Amen; and have the keys of hell and of death.

001:019 Write the things which thou hast seen, and the things which
        are, and the things which shall be hereafter;

001:020 The mystery of the seven stars which thou sawest in my right
        hand, and the seven golden candlesticks. The seven stars are
        the angels of the seven churches: and the seven candlesticks
        which thou sawest are the seven churches.

002:001 Unto the angel of the church of Ephesus write; These things
        saith he that holdeth the seven stars in his right hand, who
        walketh in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks;

002:002 I know thy works, and thy labour, and thy patience, and how
        thou canst not bear them which are evil: and thou hast tried
        them which say they are apostles, and are not, and hast found
        them liars:

002:003 And hast borne, and hast patience, and for my name's sake hast
        laboured, and hast not fainted.

002:004 Nevertheless I have somewhat against thee, because thou hast
        left thy first love.

002:005 Remember therefore from whence thou art fallen, and repent,
        and do the first works; or else I will come unto thee quickly,
        and will remove thy candlestick out of his place, except thou
        repent.

002:006 But this thou hast, that thou hatest the deeds of the
        Nicolaitanes, which I also hate.

002:007 He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto
        the churches; To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the
        tree of life, which is in the midst of the paradise of God.

002:008 And unto the angel of the church in Smyrna write; These things
        saith the first and the last, which was dead, and is alive;

002:009 I know thy works, and tribulation, and poverty, (but thou art
        rich) and I know the blasphemy of them which say they are
        Jews, and are not, but are the synagogue of Satan.

002:010 Fear none of those things which thou shalt suffer: behold, the
        devil shall cast some of you into prison, that ye may be
        tried; and ye shall have tribulation ten days: be thou
        faithful unto death, and I will give thee a crown of life.

002:011 He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto
        the churches; He that overcometh shall not be hurt of the
        second death.

002:012 And to the angel of the church in Pergamos write; These things
        saith he which hath the sharp sword with two edges;

002:013 I know thy works, and where thou dwellest, even where Satan's
        seat is: and thou holdest fast my name, and hast not denied my
        faith, even in those days wherein Antipas was my faithful
        martyr, who was slain among you, where Satan dwelleth.

002:014 But I have a few things against thee, because thou hast there
        them that hold the doctrine of Balaam, who taught Balac to
        cast a stumblingblock before the children of Israel, to eat
        things sacrificed unto idols, and to commit fornication.

002:015 So hast thou also them that hold the doctrine of the
        Nicolaitanes, which thing I hate.

002:016 Repent; or else I will come unto thee quickly, and will fight
        against them with the sword of my mouth.

002:017 He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto
        the churches; To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the
        hidden manna, and will give him a white stone, and in the
        stone a new name written, which no man knoweth saving he that
        receiveth it.

002:018 And unto the angel of the church in Thyatira write; These
        things saith the Son of God, who hath his eyes like unto a
        flame of fire, and his feet are like fine brass;

002:019 I know thy works, and charity, and service, and faith, and thy
        patience, and thy works; and the last to be more than the
        first.

002:020 Notwithstanding I have a few things against thee, because thou
        sufferest that woman Jezebel, which calleth herself a
        prophetess, to teach and to seduce my servants to commit
        fornication, and to eat things sacrificed unto idols.

002:021 And I gave her space to repent of her fornication; and she
        repented not.

002:022 Behold, I will cast her into a bed, and them that commit
        adultery with her into great tribulation, except they repent
        of their deeds.

002:023 And I will kill her children with death; and all the churches
        shall know that I am he which searcheth the reins and hearts:
        and I will give unto every one of you according to your works.

002:024 But unto you I say, and unto the rest in Thyatira, as many as
        have not this doctrine, and which have not known the depths of
        Satan, as they speak; I will put upon you none other burden.

002:025 But that which ye have already hold fast till I come.

002:026 And he that overcometh, and keepeth my works unto the end, to
        him will I give power over the nations:

002:027 And he shall rule them with a rod of iron; as the vessels of a
        potter shall they be broken to shivers: even as I received of
        my Father.

002:028 And I will give him the morning star.

002:029 He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto
        the churches.

003:001 And unto the angel of the church in Sardis write; These things
        saith he that hath the seven Spirits of God, and the seven
        stars; I know thy works, that thou hast a name that thou
        livest, and art dead.

003:002 Be watchful, and strengthen the things which remain, that are
        ready to die: for I have not found thy works perfect before
        God.

003:003 Remember therefore how thou hast received and heard, and hold
        fast, and repent. If therefore thou shalt not watch, I will
        come on thee as a thief, and thou shalt not know what hour I
        will come upon thee.

003:004 Thou hast a few names even in Sardis which have not defiled
        their garments; and they shall walk with me in white: for they
        are worthy.

003:005 He that overcometh, the same shall be clothed in white
        raiment; and I will not blot out his name out of the book of
        life, but I will confess his name before my Father, and before
        his angels.

003:006 He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto
        the churches.

003:007 And to the angel of the church in Philadelphia write; These
        things saith he that is holy, he that is true, he that hath
        the key of David, he that openeth, and no man shutteth; and
        shutteth, and no man openeth;

003:008 I know thy works: behold, I have set before thee an open door,
        and no man can shut it: for thou hast a little strength, and
        hast kept my word, and hast not denied my name.

003:009 Behold, I will make them of the synagogue of Satan, which say
        they are Jews, and are not, but do lie; behold, I will make
        them to come and worship before thy feet, and to know that I
        have loved thee.

003:010 Because thou hast kept the word of my patience, I also will
        keep thee from the hour of temptation, which shall come upon
        all the world, to try them that dwell upon the earth.

003:011 Behold, I come quickly: hold that fast which thou hast, that
        no man take thy crown.

003:012 Him that overcometh will I make a pillar in the temple of my
        God, and he shall go no more out: and I will write upon him
        the name of my God, and the name of the city of my God, which
        is new Jerusalem, which cometh down out of heaven from my God:
        and I will write upon him my new name.

003:013 He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto
        the churches.

003:014 And unto the angel of the church of the Laodiceans write;
        These things saith the Amen, the faithful and true witness,
        the beginning of the creation of God;

003:015 I know thy works, that thou art neither cold nor hot: I would
        thou wert cold or hot.

003:016 So then because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I
        will spue thee out of my mouth.

003:017 Because thou sayest, I am rich, and increased with goods, and
        have need of nothing; and knowest not that thou art wretched,
        and miserable, and poor, and blind, and naked:

003:018 I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire, that thou
        mayest be rich; and white raiment, that thou mayest be
        clothed, and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear;
        and anoint thine eyes with eyesalve, that thou mayest see.

003:019 As many as I love, I rebuke and chasten: be zealous therefore,
        and repent.

003:020 Behold, I stand at the door, and knock: if any man hear my
        voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will sup
        with him, and he with me.

003:021 To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my
        throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with my
        Father in his throne.

003:022 He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto
        the churches.

004:001 After this I looked, and, behold, a door was opened in heaven:
        and the first voice which I heard was as it were of a trumpet
        talking with me; which said, Come up hither, and I will shew
        thee things which must be hereafter.

004:002 And immediately I was in the spirit: and, behold, a throne was
        set in heaven, and one sat on the throne.

004:003 And he that sat was to look upon like a jasper and a sardine
        stone: and there was a rainbow round about the throne, in
        sight like unto an emerald.

004:004 And round about the throne were four and twenty seats: and
        upon the seats I saw four and twenty elders sitting, clothed
        in white raiment; and they had on their heads crowns of gold.

004:005 And out of the throne proceeded lightnings and thunderings and
        voices: and there were seven lamps of fire burning before the
        throne, which are the seven Spirits of God.

004:006 And before the throne there was a sea of glass like unto
        crystal: and in the midst of the throne, and round about the
        throne, were four beasts full of eyes before and behind.

004:007 And the first beast was like a lion, and the second beast like
        a calf, and the third beast had a face as a man, and the
        fourth beast was like a flying eagle.

004:008 And the four beasts had each of them six wings about him; and
        they were full of eyes within: and they rest not day and
        night, saying, Holy, holy, holy, LORD God Almighty, which was,
        and is, and is to come.

004:009 And when those beasts give glory and honour and thanks to him
        that sat on the throne, who liveth for ever and ever,

004:010 The four and twenty elders fall down before him that sat on
        the throne, and worship him that liveth for ever and ever, and
        cast their crowns before the throne, saying,

004:011 Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and honour and
        power: for thou hast created all things, and for thy pleasure
        they are and were created.

005:001 And I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a
        book written within and on the backside, sealed with seven
        seals.

005:002 And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, Who is
        worthy to open the book, and to loose the seals thereof?

005:003 And no man in heaven, nor in earth, neither under the earth,
        was able to open the book, neither to look thereon.

005:004 And I wept much, because no man was found worthy to open and
        to read the book, neither to look thereon.

005:005 And one of the elders saith unto me, Weep not: behold, the
        Lion of the tribe of Juda, the Root of David, hath prevailed
        to open the book, and to loose the seven seals thereof.

005:006 And I beheld, and, lo, in the midst of the throne and of the
        four beasts, and in the midst of the elders, stood a Lamb as
        it had been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which
        are the seven Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth.

005:007 And he came and took the book out of the right hand of him
        that sat upon the throne.

005:008 And when he had taken the book, the four beasts and four and
        twenty elders fell down before the Lamb, having every one of
        them harps, and golden vials full of odours, which are the
        prayers of saints.

005:009 And they sung a new song, saying, Thou art worthy to take the
        book, and to open the seals thereof: for thou wast slain, and
        hast redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every kindred, and
        tongue, and people, and nation;

005:010 And hast made us unto our God kings and priests: and we shall
        reign on the earth.

005:011 And I beheld, and I heard the voice of many angels round about
        the throne and the beasts and the elders: and the number of
        them was ten thousand times ten thousand, and thousands of
        thousands;

005:012 Saying with a loud voice, Worthy is the Lamb that was slain to
        receive power, and riches, and wisdom, and strength, and
        honour, and glory, and blessing.

005:013 And every creature which is in heaven, and on the earth, and
        under the earth, and such as are in the sea, and all that are
        in them, heard I saying, Blessing, and honour, and glory, and
        power, be unto him that sitteth upon the throne, and unto the
        Lamb for ever and ever.

005:014 And the four beasts said, Amen. And the four and twenty elders
        fell down and worshipped him that liveth for ever and ever.

006:001 And I saw when the Lamb opened one of the seals, and I heard,
        as it were the noise of thunder, one of the four beasts
        saying, Come and see.

006:002 And I saw, and behold a white horse: and he that sat on him
        had a bow; and a crown was given unto him: and he went forth
        conquering, and to conquer.

006:003 And when he had opened the second seal, I heard the second
        beast say, Come and see.

006:004 And there went out another horse that was red: and power was
        given to him that sat thereon to take peace from the earth,
        and that they should kill one another: and there was given
        unto him a great sword.

006:005 And when he had opened the third seal, I heard the third beast
        say, Come and see. And I beheld, and lo a black horse; and he
        that sat on him had a pair of balances in his hand.

006:006 And I heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts say, A
        measure of wheat for a penny, and three measures of barley for
        a penny; and see thou hurt not the oil and the wine.

006:007 And when he had opened the fourth seal, I heard the voice of
        the fourth beast say, Come and see.

006:008 And I looked, and behold a pale horse: and his name that sat
        on him was Death, and Hell followed with him. And power was
        given unto them over the fourth part of the earth, to kill
        with sword, and with hunger, and with death, and with the
        beasts of the earth.

006:009 And when he had opened the fifth seal, I saw under the altar
        the souls of them that were slain for the word of God, and for
        the testimony which they held:

006:010 And they cried with a loud voice, saying, How long, O Lord,
        holy and true, dost thou not judge and avenge our blood on
        them that dwell on the earth?

006:011 And white robes were given unto every one of them; and it was
        said unto them, that they should rest yet for a little season,
        until their fellowservants also and their brethren, that
        should be killed as they were, should be fulfilled.

006:012 And I beheld when he had opened the sixth seal, and, lo, there
        was a great earthquake; and the sun became black as sackcloth
        of hair, and the moon became as blood;

006:013 And the stars of heaven fell unto the earth, even as a fig
        tree casteth her untimely figs, when she is shaken of a mighty
        wind.

006:014 And the heaven departed as a scroll when it is rolled
        together; and every mountain and island were moved out of
        their places.

006:015 And the kings of the earth, and the great men, and the rich
        men, and the chief captains, and the mighty men, and every
        bondman, and every free man, hid themselves in the dens and in
        the rocks of the mountains;

006:016 And said to the mountains and rocks, Fall on us, and hide us
        from the face of him that sitteth on the throne, and from the
        wrath of the Lamb:

006:017 For the great day of his wrath is come; and who shall be able
        to stand?

007:001 And after these things I saw four angels standing on the four
        corners of the earth, holding the four winds of the earth,
        that the wind should not blow on the earth, nor on the sea,
        nor on any tree.

007:002 And I saw another angel ascending from the east, having the
        seal of the living God: and he cried with a loud voice to the
        four angels, to whom it was given to hurt the earth and the
        sea,

007:003 Saying, Hurt not the earth, neither the sea, nor the trees,
        till we have sealed the servants of our God in their
        foreheads.

007:004 And I heard the number of them which were sealed: and there
        were sealed an hundred and forty and four thousand of all the
        tribes of the children of Israel.

007:005 Of the tribe of Juda were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe
        of Reuben were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of Gad
        were sealed twelve thousand.

007:006 Of the tribe of Aser were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe
        of Nephthalim were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of
        Manasses were sealed twelve thousand.

007:007 Of the tribe of Simeon were sealed twelve thousand. Of the
        tribe of Levi were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of
        Issachar were sealed twelve thousand.

007:008 Of the tribe of Zabulon were sealed twelve thousand. Of the
        tribe of Joseph were sealed twelve thousand. Of the tribe of
        Benjamin were sealed twelve thousand.

007:009 After this I beheld, and, lo, a great multitude, which no man
        could number, of all nations, and kindreds, and people, and
        tongues, stood before the throne, and before the Lamb, clothed
        with white robes, and palms in their hands;

007:010 And cried with a loud voice, saying, Salvation to our God
        which sitteth upon the throne, and unto the Lamb.

007:011 And all the angels stood round about the throne, and about the
        elders and the four beasts, and fell before the throne on
        their faces, and worshipped God,

007:012 Saying, Amen: Blessing, and glory, and wisdom, and
        thanksgiving, and honour, and power, and might, be unto our
        God for ever and ever. Amen.

007:013 And one of the elders answered, saying unto me, What are these
        which are arrayed in white robes? and whence came they?

007:014 And I said unto him, Sir, thou knowest. And he said to me,
        These are they which came out of great tribulation, and have
        washed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the
        Lamb.

007:015 Therefore are they before the throne of God, and serve him day
        and night in his temple: and he that sitteth on the throne
        shall dwell among them.

007:016 They shall hunger no more, neither thirst any more; neither
        shall the sun light on them, nor any heat.

007:017 For the Lamb which is in the midst of the throne shall feed
        them, and shall lead them unto living fountains of waters: and
        God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes.

008:001 And when he had opened the seventh seal, there was silence in
        heaven about the space of half an hour.

008:002 And I saw the seven angels which stood before God; and to them
        were given seven trumpets.

008:003 And another angel came and stood at the altar, having a golden
        censer; and there was given unto him much incense, that he
        should offer it with the prayers of all saints upon the golden
        altar which was before the throne.

008:004 And the smoke of the incense, which came with the prayers of
        the saints, ascended up before God out of the angel's hand.

008:005 And the angel took the censer, and filled it with fire of the
        altar, and cast it into the earth: and there were voices, and
        thunderings, and lightnings, and an earthquake.

008:006 And the seven angels which had the seven trumpets prepared
        themselves to sound.

008:007 The first angel sounded, and there followed hail and fire
        mingled with blood, and they were cast upon the earth: and the
        third part of trees was burnt up, and all green grass was
        burnt up.

008:008 And the second angel sounded, and as it were a great mountain
        burning with fire was cast into the sea: and the third part of
        the sea became blood;

008:009 And the third part of the creatures which were in the sea, and
        had life, died; and the third part of the ships were
        destroyed.

008:010 And the third angel sounded, and there fell a great star from
        heaven, burning as it were a lamp, and it fell upon the third
        part of the rivers, and upon the fountains of waters;

008:011 And the name of the star is called Wormwood: and the third
        part of the waters became wormwood; and many men died of the
        waters, because they were made bitter.

008:012 And the fourth angel sounded, and the third part of the sun
        was smitten, and the third part of the moon, and the third
        part of the stars; so as the third part of them was darkened,
        and the day shone not for a third part of it, and the night
        likewise.

008:013 And I beheld, and heard an angel flying through the midst of
        heaven, saying with a loud voice, Woe, woe, woe, to the
        inhabiters of the earth by reason of the other voices of the
        trumpet of the three angels, which are yet to sound!

009:001 And the fifth angel sounded, and I saw a star fall from heaven
        unto the earth: and to him was given the key of the bottomless
        pit.

009:002 And he opened the bottomless pit; and there arose a smoke out
        of the pit, as the smoke of a great furnace; and the sun and
        the air were darkened by reason of the smoke of the pit.

009:003 And there came out of the smoke locusts upon the earth: and
        unto them was given power, as the scorpions of the earth have
        power.

009:004 And it was commanded them that they should not hurt the grass
        of the earth, neither any green thing, neither any tree; but
        only those men which have not the seal of God in their
        foreheads.

009:005 And to them it was given that they should not kill them, but
        that they should be tormented five months: and their torment
        was as the torment of a scorpion, when he striketh a man.

009:006 And in those days shall men seek death, and shall not find it;
        and shall desire to die, and death shall flee from them.

009:007 And the shapes of the locusts were like unto horses prepared
        unto battle; and on their heads were as it were crowns like
        gold, and their faces were as the faces of men.

009:008 And they had hair as the hair of women, and their teeth were
        as the teeth of lions.

009:009 And they had breastplates, as it were breastplates of iron;
        and the sound of their wings was as the sound of chariots of
        many horses running to battle.

009:010 And they had tails like unto scorpions, and there were stings
        in their tails: and their power was to hurt men five months.

009:011 And they had a king over them, which is the angel of the
        bottomless pit, whose name in the Hebrew tongue is Abaddon,
        but in the Greek tongue hath his name Apollyon.

009:012 One woe is past; and, behold, there come two woes more
        hereafter.

009:013 And the sixth angel sounded, and I heard a voice from the four
        horns of the golden altar which is before God,

009:014 Saying to the sixth angel which had the trumpet, Loose the
        four angels which are bound in the great river Euphrates.

009:015 And the four angels were loosed, which were prepared for an
        hour, and a day, and a month, and a year, for to slay the
        third part of men.

009:016 And the number of the army of the horsemen were two hundred
        thousand thousand: and I heard the number of them.

009:017 And thus I saw the horses in the vision, and them that sat on
        them, having breastplates of fire, and of jacinth, and
        brimstone: and the heads of the horses were as the heads of
        lions; and out of their mouths issued fire and smoke and
        brimstone.

009:018 By these three was the third part of men killed, by the fire,
        and by the smoke, and by the brimstone, which issued out of
        their mouths.

009:019 For their power is in their mouth, and in their tails: for
        their tails were like unto serpents, and had heads, and with
        them they do hurt.

009:020 And the rest of the men which were not killed by these plagues
        yet repented not of the works of their hands, that they should
        not worship devils, and idols of gold, and silver, and brass,
        and stone, and of wood: which neither can see, nor hear, nor
        walk:

009:021 Neither repented they of their murders, nor of their
        sorceries, nor of their fornication, nor of their thefts.

010:001 And I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven, clothed
        with a cloud: and a rainbow was upon his head, and his face
        was as it were the sun, and his feet as pillars of fire:

010:002 And he had in his hand a little book open: and he set his
        right foot upon the sea, and his left foot on the earth,

010:003 And cried with a loud voice, as when a lion roareth: and when
        he had cried, seven thunders uttered their voices.

010:004 And when the seven thunders had uttered their voices, I was
        about to write: and I heard a voice from heaven saying unto
        me, Seal up those things which the seven thunders uttered, and
        write them not.

010:005 And the angel which I saw stand upon the sea and upon the
        earth lifted up his hand to heaven,

010:006 And sware by him that liveth for ever and ever, who created
        heaven, and the things that therein are, and the earth, and
        the things that therein are, and the sea, and the things which
        are therein, that there should be time no longer:

010:007 But in the days of the voice of the seventh angel, when he
        shall begin to sound, the mystery of God should be finished,
        as he hath declared to his servants the prophets.

010:008 And the voice which I heard from heaven spake unto me again,
        and said, Go and take the little book which is open in the
        hand of the angel which standeth upon the sea and upon the
        earth.

010:009 And I went unto the angel, and said unto him, Give me the
        little book. And he said unto me, Take it, and eat it up; and
        it shall make thy belly bitter, but it shall be in thy mouth
        sweet as honey.

010:010 And I took the little book out of the angel's hand, and ate it
        up; and it was in my mouth sweet as honey: and as soon as I
        had eaten it, my belly was bitter.

010:011 And he said unto me, Thou must prophesy again before many
        peoples, and nations, and tongues, and kings.

011:001 And there was given me a reed like unto a rod: and the angel
        stood, saying, Rise, and measure the temple of God, and the
        altar, and them that worship therein.

011:002 But the court which is without the temple leave out, and
        measure it not; for it is given unto the Gentiles: and the
        holy city shall they tread under foot forty and two months.

011:003 And I will give power unto my two witnesses, and they shall
        prophesy a thousand two hundred and threescore days, clothed
        in sackcloth.

011:004 These are the two olive trees, and the two candlesticks
        standing before the God of the earth.

011:005 And if any man will hurt them, fire proceedeth out of their
        mouth, and devoureth their enemies: and if any man will hurt
        them, he must in this manner be killed.

011:006 These have power to shut heaven, that it rain not in the days
        of their prophecy: and have power over waters to turn them to
        blood, and to smite the earth with all plagues, as often as
        they will.

011:007 And when they shall have finished their testimony, the beast
        that ascendeth out of the bottomless pit shall make war
        against them, and shall overcome them, and kill them.

011:008 And their dead bodies shall lie in the street of the great
        city, which spiritually is called Sodom and Egypt, where also
        our Lord was crucified.

011:009 And they of the people and kindreds and tongues and nations
        shall see their dead bodies three days and an half, and shall
        not suffer their dead bodies to be put in graves.

011:010 And they that dwell upon the earth shall rejoice over them,
        and make merry, and shall send gifts one to another; because
        these two prophets tormented them that dwelt on the earth.

011:011 And after three days and an half the spirit of life from God
        entered into them, and they stood upon their feet; and great
        fear fell upon them which saw them.

011:012 And they heard a great voice from heaven saying unto them,
        Come up hither. And they ascended up to heaven in a cloud; and
        their enemies beheld them.

011:013 And the same hour was there a great earthquake, and the tenth
        part of the city fell, and in the earthquake were slain of men
        seven thousand: and the remnant were affrighted, and gave
        glory to the God of heaven.

011:014 The second woe is past; and, behold, the third woe cometh
        quickly.

011:015 And the seventh angel sounded; and there were great voices in
        heaven, saying, The kingdoms of this world are become the
        kingdoms of our Lord, and of his Christ; and he shall reign
        for ever and ever.

011:016 And the four and twenty elders, which sat before God on their
        seats, fell upon their faces, and worshipped God,

011:017 Saying, We give thee thanks, O LORD God Almighty, which art,
        and wast, and art to come; because thou hast taken to thee thy
        great power, and hast reigned.

011:018 And the nations were angry, and thy wrath is come, and the
        time of the dead, that they should be judged, and that thou
        shouldest give reward unto thy servants the prophets, and to
        the saints, and them that fear thy name, small and great; and
        shouldest destroy them which destroy the earth.

011:019 And the temple of God was opened in heaven, and there was seen
        in his temple the ark of his testament: and there were
        lightnings, and voices, and thunderings, and an earthquake,
        and great hail.

012:001 And there appeared a great wonder in heaven; a woman clothed
        with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a
        crown of twelve stars:

012:002 And she being with child cried, travailing in birth, and
        pained to be delivered.

012:003 And there appeared another wonder in heaven; and behold a
        great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and seven
        crowns upon his heads.

012:004 And his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven, and
        did cast them to the earth: and the dragon stood before the
        woman which was ready to be delivered, for to devour her child
        as soon as it was born.

012:005 And she brought forth a man child, who was to rule all nations
        with a rod of iron: and her child was caught up unto God, and
        to his throne.

012:006 And the woman fled into the wilderness, where she hath a place
        prepared of God, that they should feed her there a thousand
        two hundred and threescore days.

012:007 And there was war in heaven: Michael and his angels fought
        against the dragon; and the dragon fought and his angels,

012:008 And prevailed not; neither was their place found any more in
        heaven.

012:009 And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent, called
        the Devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world: he was
        cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with
        him.

012:010 And I heard a loud voice saying in heaven, Now is come
        salvation, and strength, and the kingdom of our God, and the
        power of his Christ: for the accuser of our brethren is cast
        down, which accused them before our God day and night.

012:011 And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the
        word of their testimony; and they loved not their lives unto
        the death.

012:012 Therefore rejoice, ye heavens, and ye that dwell in them. Woe
        to the inhabiters of the earth and of the sea! for the devil
        is come down unto you, having great wrath, because he knoweth
        that he hath but a short time.

012:013 And when the dragon saw that he was cast unto the earth, he
        persecuted the woman which brought forth the man child.

012:014 And to the woman were given two wings of a great eagle, that
        she might fly into the wilderness, into her place, where she
        is nourished for a time, and times, and half a time, from the
        face of the serpent.

012:015 And the serpent cast out of his mouth water as a flood after
        the woman, that he might cause her to be carried away of the
        flood.

012:016 And the earth helped the woman, and the earth opened her
        mouth, and swallowed up the flood which the dragon cast out of
        his mouth.

012:017 And the dragon was wroth with the woman, and went to make war
        with the remnant of her seed, which keep the commandments of
        God, and have the testimony of Jesus Christ.

013:001 And I stood upon the sand of the sea, and saw a beast rise up
        out of the sea, having seven heads and ten horns, and upon his
        horns ten crowns, and upon his heads the name of blasphemy.

013:002 And the beast which I saw was like unto a leopard, and his
        feet were as the feet of a bear, and his mouth as the mouth of
        a lion: and the dragon gave him his power, and his seat, and
        great authority.

013:003 And I saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death; and
        his deadly wound was healed: and all the world wondered after
        the beast.

013:004 And they worshipped the dragon which gave power unto the
        beast: and they worshipped the beast, saying, Who is like unto
        the beast? who is able to make war with him?

013:005 And there was given unto him a mouth speaking great things and
        blasphemies; and power was given unto him to continue forty
        and two months.

013:006 And he opened his mouth in blasphemy against God, to blaspheme
        his name, and his tabernacle, and them that dwell in heaven.

013:007 And it was given unto him to make war with the saints, and to
        overcome them: and power was given him over all kindreds, and
        tongues, and nations.

013:008 And all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him, whose
        names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb slain
        from the foundation of the world.

013:009 If any man have an ear, let him hear.

013:010 He that leadeth into captivity shall go into captivity: he
        that killeth with the sword must be killed with the sword.
        Here is the patience and the faith of the saints.

013:011 And I beheld another beast coming up out of the earth; and he
        had two horns like a lamb, and he spake as a dragon.

013:012 And he exerciseth all the power of the first beast before him,
        and causeth the earth and them which dwell therein to worship
        the first beast, whose deadly wound was healed.

013:013 And he doeth great wonders, so that he maketh fire come down
        from heaven on the earth in the sight of men,

013:014 And deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by the means of
        those miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the
        beast; saying to them that dwell on the earth, that they
        should make an image to the beast, which had the wound by a
        sword, and did live.

013:015 And he had power to give life unto the image of the beast,
        that the image of the beast should both speak, and cause that
        as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be
        killed.

013:016 And he causeth all, both small and great, rich and poor, free
        and bond, to receive a mark in their right hand, or in their
        foreheads:

013:017 And that no man might buy or sell, save he that had the mark,
        or the name of the beast, or the number of his name.

013:018 Here is wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the
        number of the beast: for it is the number of a man; and his
        number is Six hundred threescore and six.

014:001 And I looked, and, lo, a Lamb stood on the mount Sion, and
        with him an hundred forty and four thousand, having his
        Father's name written in their foreheads.

014:002 And I heard a voice from heaven, as the voice of many waters,
        and as the voice of a great thunder: and I heard the voice of
        harpers harping with their harps:

014:003 And they sung as it were a new song before the throne, and
        before the four beasts, and the elders: and no man could learn
        that song but the hundred and forty and four thousand, which
        were redeemed from the earth.

014:004 These are they which were not defiled with women; for they are
        virgins. These are they which follow the Lamb whithersoever he
        goeth. These were redeemed from among men, being the
        firstfruits unto God and to the Lamb.

014:005 And in their mouth was found no guile: for they are without
        fault before the throne of God.

014:006 And I saw another angel fly in the midst of heaven, having the
        everlasting gospel to preach unto them that dwell on the
        earth, and to every nation, and kindred, and tongue, and
        people,

014:007 Saying with a loud voice, Fear God, and give glory to him; for
        the hour of his judgment is come: and worship him that made
        heaven, and earth, and the sea, and the fountains of waters.

014:008 And there followed another angel, saying, Babylon is fallen,
        is fallen, that great city, because she made all nations drink
        of the wine of the wrath of her fornication.

014:009 And the third angel followed them, saying with a loud voice,
        If any man worship the beast and his image, and receive his
        mark in his forehead, or in his hand,

014:010 The same shall drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is
        poured out without mixture into the cup of his indignation;
        and he shall be tormented with fire and brimstone in the
        presence of the holy angels, and in the presence of the Lamb:

014:011 And the smoke of their torment ascendeth up for ever and ever:
        and they have no rest day nor night, who worship the beast and
        his image, and whosoever receiveth the mark of his name.

014:012 Here is the patience of the saints: here are they that keep
        the commandments of God, and the faith of Jesus.

014:013 And I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me, Write, Blessed
        are the dead which die in the Lord from henceforth: Yea, saith
        the Spirit, that they may rest from their labours; and their
        works do follow them.

014:014 And I looked, and behold a white cloud, and upon the cloud one
        sat like unto the Son of man, having on his head a golden
        crown, and in his hand a sharp sickle.

014:015 And another angel came out of the temple, crying with a loud
        voice to him that sat on the cloud, Thrust in thy sickle, and
        reap: for the time is come for thee to reap; for the harvest
        of the earth is ripe.

014:016 And he that sat on the cloud thrust in his sickle on the
        earth; and the earth was reaped.

014:017 And another angel came out of the temple which is in heaven,
        he also having a sharp sickle.

014:018 And another angel came out from the altar, which had power
        over fire; and cried with a loud cry to him that had the sharp
        sickle, saying, Thrust in thy sharp sickle, and gather the
        clusters of the vine of the earth; for her grapes are fully
        ripe.

014:019 And the angel thrust in his sickle into the earth, and
        gathered the vine of the earth, and cast it into the great
        winepress of the wrath of God.

014:020 And the winepress was trodden without the city, and blood came
        out of the winepress, even unto the horse bridles, by the
        space of a thousand and six hundred furlongs.

015:001 And I saw another sign in heaven, great and marvellous, seven
        angels having the seven last plagues; for in them is filled up
        the wrath of God.

015:002 And I saw as it were a sea of glass mingled with fire: and
        them that had gotten the victory over the beast, and over his
        image, and over his mark, and over the number of his name,
        stand on the sea of glass, having the harps of God.

015:003 And they sing the song of Moses the servant of God, and the
        song of the Lamb, saying, Great and marvellous are thy works,
        Lord God Almighty; just and true are thy ways, thou King of
        saints.

015:004 Who shall not fear thee, O Lord, and glorify thy name? for
        thou only art holy: for all nations shall come and worship
        before thee; for thy judgments are made manifest.

015:005 And after that I looked, and, behold, the temple of the
        tabernacle of the testimony in heaven was opened:

015:006 And the seven angels came out of the temple, having the seven
        plagues, clothed in pure and white linen, and having their
        breasts girded with golden girdles.

015:007 And one of the four beasts gave unto the seven angels seven
        golden vials full of the wrath of God, who liveth for ever and
        ever.

015:008 And the temple was filled with smoke from the glory of God,
        and from his power; and no man was able to enter into the
        temple, till the seven plagues of the seven angels were
        fulfilled.

016:001 And I heard a great voice out of the temple saying to the
        seven angels, Go your ways, and pour out the vials of the
        wrath of God upon the earth.

016:002 And the first went, and poured out his vial upon the earth;
        and there fell a noisome and grievous sore upon the men which
        had the mark of the beast, and upon them which worshipped his
        image.

016:003 And the second angel poured out his vial upon the sea; and it
        became as the blood of a dead man: and every living soul died
        in the sea.

016:004 And the third angel poured out his vial upon the rivers and
        fountains of waters; and they became blood.

016:005 And I heard the angel of the waters say, Thou art righteous, O
        Lord, which art, and wast, and shalt be, because thou hast
        judged thus.

016:006 For they have shed the blood of saints and prophets, and thou
        hast given them blood to drink; for they are worthy.

016:007 And I heard another out of the altar say, Even so, Lord God
        Almighty, true and righteous are thy judgments.

016:008 And the fourth angel poured out his vial upon the sun; and
        power was given unto him to scorch men with fire.

016:009 And men were scorched with great heat, and blasphemed the name
        of God, which hath power over these plagues: and they repented
        not to give him glory.

016:010 And the fifth angel poured out his vial upon the seat of the
        beast; and his kingdom was full of darkness; and they gnawed
        their tongues for pain,

016:011 And blasphemed the God of heaven because of their pains and
        their sores, and repented not of their deeds.

016:012 And the sixth angel poured out his vial upon the great river
        Euphrates; and the water thereof was dried up, that the way of
        the kings of the east might be prepared.

016:013 And I saw three unclean spirits like frogs come out of the
        mouth of the dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and
        out of the mouth of the false prophet.

016:014 For they are the spirits of devils, working miracles, which go
        forth unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world, to
        gather them to the battle of that great day of God Almighty.

016:015 Behold, I come as a thief. Blessed is he that watcheth, and
        keepeth his garments, lest he walk naked, and they see his
        shame.

016:016 And he gathered them together into a place called in the
        Hebrew tongue Armageddon.

016:017 And the seventh angel poured out his vial into the air; and
        there came a great voice out of the temple of heaven, from the
        throne, saying, It is done.

016:018 And there were voices, and thunders, and lightnings; and there
        was a great earthquake, such as was not since men were upon
        the earth, so mighty an earthquake, and so great.

016:019 And the great city was divided into three parts, and the
        cities of the nations fell: and great Babylon came in
        remembrance before God, to give unto her the cup of the wine
        of the fierceness of his wrath.

016:020 And every island fled away, and the mountains were not found.

016:021 And there fell upon men a great hail out of heaven, every
        stone about the weight of a talent: and men blasphemed God
        because of the plague of the hail; for the plague thereof was
        exceeding great.

017:001 And there came one of the seven angels which had the seven
        vials, and talked with me, saying unto me, Come hither; I will
        shew unto thee the judgment of the great whore that sitteth
        upon many waters:

017:002 With whom the kings of the earth have committed fornication,
        and the inhabitants of the earth have been made drunk with the
        wine of her fornication.

017:003 So he carried me away in the spirit into the wilderness: and I
        saw a woman sit upon a scarlet coloured beast, full of names
        of blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns.

017:004 And the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet colour, and
        decked with gold and precious stones and pearls, having a
        golden cup in her hand full of abominations and filthiness of
        her fornication:

017:005 And upon her forehead was a name written, MYSTERY, BABYLON THE
        GREAT, THE MOTHER OF HARLOTS AND ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH.

017:006 And I saw the woman drunken with the blood of the saints, and
        with the blood of the martyrs of Jesus: and when I saw her, I
        wondered with great admiration.

017:007 And the angel said unto me, Wherefore didst thou marvel? I
        will tell thee the mystery of the woman, and of the beast that
        carrieth her, which hath the seven heads and ten horns.

017:008 The beast that thou sawest was, and is not; and shall ascend
        out of the bottomless pit, and go into perdition: and they
        that dwell on the earth shall wonder, whose names were not
        written in the book of life from the foundation of the world,
        when they behold the beast that was, and is not, and yet is.

017:009 And here is the mind which hath wisdom. The seven heads are
        seven mountains, on which the woman sitteth.

017:010 And there are seven kings: five are fallen, and one is, and
        the other is not yet come; and when he cometh, he must
        continue a short space.

017:011 And the beast that was, and is not, even he is the eighth, and
        is of the seven, and goeth into perdition.

017:012 And the ten horns which thou sawest are ten kings, which have
        received no kingdom as yet; but receive power as kings one
        hour with the beast.

017:013 These have one mind, and shall give their power and strength
        unto the beast.

017:014 These shall make war with the Lamb, and the Lamb shall
        overcome them: for he is Lord of lords, and King of kings: and
        they that are with him are called, and chosen, and faithful.

017:015 And he saith unto me, The waters which thou sawest, where the
        whore sitteth, are peoples, and multitudes, and nations, and
        tongues.

017:016 And the ten horns which thou sawest upon the beast, these
        shall hate the whore, and shall make her desolate and naked,
        and shall eat her flesh, and burn her with fire.

017:017 For God hath put in their hearts to fulfil his will, and to
        agree, and give their kingdom unto the beast, until the words
        of God shall be fulfilled.

017:018 And the woman which thou sawest is that great city, which
        reigneth over the kings of the earth.

018:001 And after these things I saw another angel come down from
        heaven, having great power; and the earth was lightened with
        his glory.

018:002 And he cried mightily with a strong voice, saying, Babylon the
        great is fallen, is fallen, and is become the habitation of
        devils, and the hold of every foul spirit, and a cage of every
        unclean and hateful bird.

018:003 For all nations have drunk of the wine of the wrath of her
        fornication, and the kings of the earth have committed
        fornication with her, and the merchants of the earth are waxed
        rich through the abundance of her delicacies.

018:004 And I heard another voice from heaven, saying, Come out of
        her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that
        ye receive not of her plagues.

018:005 For her sins have reached unto heaven, and God hath remembered
        her iniquities.

018:006 Reward her even as she rewarded you, and double unto her
        double according to her works: in the cup which she hath
        filled fill to her double.

018:007 How much she hath glorified herself, and lived deliciously, so
        much torment and sorrow give her: for she saith in her heart,
        I sit a queen, and am no widow, and shall see no sorrow.

018:008 Therefore shall her plagues come in one day, death, and
        mourning, and famine; and she shall be utterly burned with
        fire: for strong is the Lord God who judgeth her.

018:009 And the kings of the earth, who have committed fornication and
        lived deliciously with her, shall bewail her, and lament for
        her, when they shall see the smoke of her burning,

018:010 Standing afar off for the fear of her torment, saying, Alas,
        alas that great city Babylon, that mighty city! for in one
        hour is thy judgment come.

018:011 And the merchants of the earth shall weep and mourn over her;
        for no man buyeth their merchandise any more:

018:012 The merchandise of gold, and silver, and precious stones, and
        of pearls, and fine linen, and purple, and silk, and scarlet,
        and all thyine wood, and all manner vessels of ivory, and all
        manner vessels of most precious wood, and of brass, and iron,
        and marble,

018:013 And cinnamon, and odours, and ointments, and frankincense, and
        wine, and oil, and fine flour, and wheat, and beasts, and
        sheep, and horses, and chariots, and slaves, and souls of men.

018:014 And the fruits that thy soul lusted after are departed from
        thee, and all things which were dainty and goodly are departed
        from thee, and thou shalt find them no more at all.

018:015 The merchants of these things, which were made rich by her,
        shall stand afar off for the fear of her torment, weeping and
        wailing,

018:016 And saying, Alas, alas that great city, that was clothed in
        fine linen, and purple, and scarlet, and decked with gold, and
        precious stones, and pearls!

018:017 For in one hour so great riches is come to nought. And every
        shipmaster, and all the company in ships, and sailors, and as
        many as trade by sea, stood afar off,

018:018 And cried when they saw the smoke of her burning, saying, What
        city is like unto this great city!

018:019 And they cast dust on their heads, and cried, weeping and
        wailing, saying, Alas, alas that great city, wherein were made
        rich all that had ships in the sea by reason of her
        costliness! for in one hour is she made desolate.

018:020 Rejoice over her, thou heaven, and ye holy apostles and
        prophets; for God hath avenged you on her.

018:021 And a mighty angel took up a stone like a great millstone, and
        cast it into the sea, saying, Thus with violence shall that
        great city Babylon be thrown down, and shall be found no more
        at all.

018:022 And the voice of harpers, and musicians, and of pipers, and
        trumpeters, shall be heard no more at all in thee; and no
        craftsman, of whatsoever craft he be, shall be found any more
        in thee; and the sound of a millstone shall be heard no more
        at all in thee;

018:023 And the light of a candle shall shine no more at all in thee;
        and the voice of the bridegroom and of the bride shall be
        heard no more at all in thee: for thy merchants were the great
        men of the earth; for by thy sorceries were all nations
        deceived.

018:024 And in her was found the blood of prophets, and of saints, and
        of all that were slain upon the earth.

019:001 And after these things I heard a great voice of much people in
        heaven, saying, Alleluia; Salvation, and glory, and honour,
        and power, unto the Lord our God:

019:002 For true and righteous are his judgments: for he hath judged
        the great whore, which did corrupt the earth with her
        fornication, and hath avenged the blood of his servants at her
        hand.

019:003 And again they said, Alleluia And her smoke rose up for ever
        and ever.

019:004 And the four and twenty elders and the four beasts fell down
        and worshipped God that sat on the throne, saying, Amen;
        Alleluia.

019:005 And a voice came out of the throne, saying, Praise our God,
        all ye his servants, and ye that fear him, both small and
        great.

019:006 And I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude, and as
        the voice of many waters, and as the voice of mighty
        thunderings, saying, Alleluia: for the Lord God omnipotent
        reigneth.

019:007 Let us be glad and rejoice, and give honour to him: for the
        marriage of the Lamb is come, and his wife hath made herself
        ready.

019:008 And to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine
        linen, clean and white: for the fine linen is the
        righteousness of saints.

019:009 And he saith unto me, Write, Blessed are they which are called
        unto the marriage supper of the Lamb. And he saith unto me,
        These are the true sayings of God.

019:010 And I fell at his feet to worship him. And he said unto me,
        See thou do it not: I am thy fellowservant, and of thy
        brethren that have the testimony of Jesus: worship God: for
        the testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.

019:011 And I saw heaven opened, and behold a white horse; and he that
        sat upon him was called Faithful and True, and in
        righteousness he doth judge and make war.

019:012 His eyes were as a flame of fire, and on his head were many
        crowns; and he had a name written, that no man knew, but he
        himself.

019:013 And he was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood: and his
        name is called The Word of God.

019:014 And the armies which were in heaven followed him upon white
        horses, clothed in fine linen, white and clean.

019:015 And out of his mouth goeth a sharp sword, that with it he
        should smite the nations: and he shall rule them with a rod of
        iron: and he treadeth the winepress of the fierceness and
        wrath of Almighty God.

019:016 And he hath on his vesture and on his thigh a name written,
        KING OF KINGS, AND LORD OF LORDS.

019:017 And I saw an angel standing in the sun; and he cried with a
        loud voice, saying to all the fowls that fly in the midst of
        heaven, Come and gather yourselves together unto the supper of
        the great God;

019:018 That ye may eat the flesh of kings, and the flesh of captains,
        and the flesh of mighty men, and the flesh of horses, and of
        them that sit on them, and the flesh of all men, both free and
        bond, both small and great.

019:019 And I saw the beast, and the kings of the earth, and their
        armies, gathered together to make war against him that sat on
        the horse, and against his army.

019:020 And the beast was taken, and with him the false prophet that
        wrought miracles before him, with which he deceived them that
        had received the mark of the beast, and them that worshipped
        his image. These both were cast alive into a lake of fire
        burning with brimstone.

019:021 And the remnant were slain with the sword of him that sat upon
        the horse, which sword proceeded out of his mouth: and all the
        fowls were filled with their flesh.

020:001 And I saw an angel come down from heaven, having the key of
        the bottomless pit and a great chain in his hand.

020:002 And he laid hold on the dragon, that old serpent, which is the
        Devil, and Satan, and bound him a thousand years,

020:003 And cast him into the bottomless pit, and shut him up, and set
        a seal upon him, that he should deceive the nations no more,
        till the thousand years should be fulfilled: and after that he
        must be loosed a little season.

020:004 And I saw thrones, and they sat upon them, and judgment was
        given unto them: and I saw the souls of them that were
        beheaded for the witness of Jesus, and for the word of God,
        and which had not worshipped the beast, neither his image,
        neither had received his mark upon their foreheads, or in
        their hands; and they lived and reigned with Christ a thousand
        years.

020:005 But the rest of the dead lived not again until the thousand
        years were finished. This is the first resurrection.

020:006 Blessed and holy is he that hath part in the first
        resurrection: on such the second death hath no power, but they
        shall be priests of God and of Christ, and shall reign with
        him a thousand years.

020:007 And when the thousand years are expired, Satan shall be loosed
        out of his prison,

020:008 And shall go out to deceive the nations which are in the four
        quarters of the earth, Gog, and Magog, to gather them together
        to battle: the number of whom is as the sand of the sea.

020:009 And they went up on the breadth of the earth, and compassed
        the camp of the saints about, and the beloved city: and fire
        came down from God out of heaven, and devoured them.

020:010 And the devil that deceived them was cast into the lake of
        fire and brimstone, where the beast and the false prophet are,
        and shall be tormented day and night for ever and ever.

020:011 And I saw a great white throne, and him that sat on it, from
        whose face the earth and the heaven fled away; and there was
        found no place for them.

020:012 And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God; and the
        books were opened: and another book was opened, which is the
        book of life: and the dead were judged out of those things
        which were written in the books, according to their works.

020:013 And the sea gave up the dead which were in it; and death and
        hell delivered up the dead which were in them: and they were
        judged every man according to their works.

020:014 And death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. This is
        the second death.

020:015 And whosoever was not found written in the book of life was
        cast into the lake of fire.

021:001 And I saw a new heaven and a new earth: for the first heaven
        and the first earth were passed away; and there was no more
        sea.

021:002 And I John saw the holy city, new Jerusalem, coming down from
        God out of heaven, prepared as a bride adorned for her
        husband.

021:003 And I heard a great voice out of heaven saying, Behold, the
        tabernacle of God is with men, and he will dwell with them,
        and they shall be his people, and God himself shall be with
        them, and be their God.

021:004 And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there
        shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither
        shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed
        away.

021:005 And he that sat upon the throne said, Behold, I make all
        things new. And he said unto me, Write: for these words are
        true and faithful.

021:006 And he said unto me, It is done. I am Alpha and Omega, the
        beginning and the end. I will give unto him that is athirst of
        the fountain of the water of life freely.

021:007 He that overcometh shall inherit all things; and I will be his
        God, and he shall be my son.

021:008 But the fearful, and unbelieving, and the abominable, and
        murderers, and whoremongers, and sorcerers, and idolaters, and
        all liars, shall have their part in the lake which burneth
        with fire and brimstone: which is the second death.

021:009 And there came unto me one of the seven angels which had the
        seven vials full of the seven last plagues, and talked with
        me, saying, Come hither, I will shew thee the bride, the
        Lamb's wife.

021:010 And he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high
        mountain, and shewed me that great city, the holy Jerusalem,
        descending out of heaven from God,

021:011 Having the glory of God: and her light was like unto a stone
        most precious, even like a jasper stone, clear as crystal;

021:012 And had a wall great and high, and had twelve gates, and at
        the gates twelve angels, and names written thereon, which are
        the names of the twelve tribes of the children of Israel:

021:013 On the east three gates; on the north three gates; on the
        south three gates; and on the west three gates.

021:014 And the wall of the city had twelve foundations, and in them
        the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb.

021:015 And he that talked with me had a golden reed to measure the
        city, and the gates thereof, and the wall thereof.

021:016 And the city lieth foursquare, and the length is as large as
        the breadth: and he measured the city with the reed, twelve
        thousand furlongs. The length and the breadth and the height
        of it are equal.

021:017 And he measured the wall thereof, an hundred and forty and
        four cubits, according to the measure of a man, that is, of
        the angel.

021:018 And the building of the wall of it was of jasper: and the city
        was pure gold, like unto clear glass.

021:019 And the foundations of the wall of the city were garnished
        with all manner of precious stones. The first foundation was
        jasper; the second, sapphire; the third, a chalcedony; the
        fourth, an emerald;

021:020 The fifth, sardonyx; the sixth, sardius; the seventh,
        chrysolyte; the eighth, beryl; the ninth, a topaz; the tenth,
        a chrysoprasus; the eleventh, a jacinth; the twelfth, an
        amethyst.

021:021 And the twelve gates were twelve pearls: every several gate
        was of one pearl: and the street of the city was pure gold, as
        it were transparent glass.

021:022 And I saw no temple therein: for the Lord God Almighty and the
        Lamb are the temple of it.

021:023 And the city had no need of the sun, neither of the moon, to
        shine in it: for the glory of God did lighten it, and the Lamb
        is the light thereof.

021:024 And the nations of them which are saved shall walk in the
        light of it: and the kings of the earth do bring their glory
        and honour into it.

021:025 And the gates of it shall not be shut at all by day: for there
        shall be no night there.

021:026 And they shall bring the glory and honour of the nations into
        it.

021:027 And there shall in no wise enter into it any thing that
        defileth, neither whatsoever worketh abomination, or maketh a
        lie: but they which are written in the Lamb's book of life.

022:001 And he shewed me a pure river of water of life, clear as
        crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb.

022:002 In the midst of the street of it, and on either side of the
        river, was there the tree of life, which bare twelve manner of
        fruits, and yielded her fruit every month: and the leaves of
        the tree were for the healing of the nations.

022:003 And there shall be no more curse: but the throne of God and of
        the Lamb shall be in it; and his servants shall serve him:

022:004 And they shall see his face; and his name shall be in their
        foreheads.

022:005 And there shall be no night there; and they need no candle,
        neither light of the sun; for the Lord God giveth them light:
        and they shall reign for ever and ever.

022:006 And he said unto me, These sayings are faithful and true: and
        the Lord God of the holy prophets sent his angel to shew unto
        his servants the things which must shortly be done.

022:007 Behold, I come quickly: blessed is he that keepeth the sayings
        of the prophecy of this book.

022:008 And I John saw these things, and heard them. And when I had
        heard and seen, I fell down to worship before the feet of the
        angel which shewed me these things.

022:009 Then saith he unto me, See thou do it not: for I am thy
        fellowservant, and of thy brethren the prophets, and of them
        which keep the sayings of this book: worship God.

022:010 And he saith unto me, Seal not the sayings of the prophecy of
        this book: for the time is at hand.

022:011 He that is unjust, let him be unjust still: and he which is
        filthy, let him be filthy still: and he that is righteous, let
        him be righteous still: and he that is holy, let him be holy
        still.

022:012 And, behold, I come quickly; and my reward is with me, to give
        every man according as his work shall be.

022:013 I am Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, the first and
        the last.

022:014 Blessed are they that do his commandments, that they may have
        right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates
        into the city.

022:015 For without are dogs, and sorcerers, and whoremongers, and
        murderers, and idolaters, and whosoever loveth and maketh a
        lie.

022:016 I Jesus have sent mine angel to testify unto you these things
        in the churches. I am the root and the offspring of David, and
        the bright and morning star.

022:017 And the Spirit and the bride say, Come. And let him that
        heareth say, Come. And let him that is athirst come. And
        whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely.

022:018 For I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the
        prophecy of this book, If any man shall add unto these things,
        God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this
        book:

022:019 And if any man shall take away from the words of the book of
        this prophecy, God shall take away his part out of the book of
        life, and out of the holy city, and from the things which are
        written in this book.

022:020 He which testifieth these things saith, Surely I come quickly.
        Amen. Even so, come, Lord Jesus.

022:021 The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all. Amen.
